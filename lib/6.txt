WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 Translated by the club Translated by everyone  00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.900 Of all the improvements made by SideFX in Houdini over the past few years,  00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.700 I was most pleased with the Vellum system.  00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.300 As artists around and generalists,  00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.000 we often omit one of the most important components of a truthful and exciting shot or scene,  00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000 this is the movement of objects.  00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000 Vellum is the best in the industry and the most powerful simulation tools in Houdini have become more accessible.  00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000 Not that they were not there before,  00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000 but the previous tools were developed taking into account the interests of the effects artists.  00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000 Therefore, the training was unique and had to make a long way to a realistic result.  00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000 And I, as an artist around, just need the curtains to be nicely draped, the ropes to be hung,  00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000 and the paper was flying all over the scene.  00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000 And with Vellum, it's all done very easily and fun.  00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000 This week we will focus on the trade area that we are doing for our scene.  00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000 And in the process we will consider four main components of Vellum.  00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000 This is Vellum Claws,  00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000 Vellum String,  00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000 Soft Body,  00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000 and also Rigid Body.  00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000 And we will approach all these processes taking into account the procedurality.  00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000 At the end of this week, we will take all these lessons, all this theory,  00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000 and use it in practice to create procedural benches for our market.  00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000 Thank you for watching!
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000 VellumClos is one of the main elements of the whole setup.  00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000 And we will use it all the time to perform the most different things.  00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000 In this lesson, I want to demonstrate how to configure the setup with VellumClos.  00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000 I will show you the various nodes that are associated with it.  00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000 I will show you how these nodes will become the basis for any simulation of Vellum  00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000 and I will show you the functional capabilities of this working process.  00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000 And then we use it in practice.  00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000 So, let's get back to Houdini.  00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000 First, we need to create something that we can simulate.  00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000 I'll start with the mesh.  00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 This will be our fabric.  00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000 I will set up the camera better.  00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000 Now, to start the simulation, I need two things.  00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000 The VellumConstraints node and the VellumSolver node.  00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000 If I change the name, I will write Clos.  00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000 And here will be the VellumConfigureClos node.  00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000 In fact, this is the VellumConstraints node,  00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000 which already has the VellumClos option  00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000 and some parameters pre-set.  00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000 That is, for fabric you can use this node as a basis.  00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000 And then the second one is the VellumSolver.  00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000 If you look at the VellumConstraints node,  00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000 you will see that it is already set up.  00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000 And here is the VellumSolver.  00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000 If you look at the VellumClos node,  00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000 you will see that it has three inputs.  00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000 The main one, that is, the VellumGeometry,  00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000 the Geometry of Constraints  00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000 and the Geometry for Collision.  00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000 I will connect this hand to the RebelWay  00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000 in the CollisionGeometry slot.  00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000 In most setups, the VellumSolver will be the last.  00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000 But it's all easy to connect, I focus on colors.  00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000 Next, everything is simple.  00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000 We have the geometry that we want to simulate.  00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000 And let's divide it more.  00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000 So that we have enough geometry.  00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000 So, now this geometry is converted into fabric.  00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000 And we will consider these parameters a little later.  00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000 Next, we have the geometry with which this fabric should interact.  00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000 And at the end, the VellumSolver, which calculates all this,  00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000 performs the simulation.  00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000 Let's turn it on.  00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000 It looks great.  00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000 Of course, we still need to change a lot of parameters.  00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000 Let's start with the most important ones.  00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000 Well, the first thing to mention is what we have already changed.  00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000 This is the geometry of the VellumSolver.  00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000 The higher the resolution, the slower the simulation will be.  00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 But the higher the quality.  00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000 If I make 100 by 100 rows of columns.  00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000 Notice that the color at the bottom has changed on the scale.  00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000 Blue is when the simulation is already cached.  00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000 And when the strip becomes orange, it means that you have updated something.  00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000 But for now you see the cached simulation.  00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000 If I go back to the beginning, all the cache will be cleared.  00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000 I'll turn it on again.  00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000 And we will see the simulation with this higher polygonal geometry.  00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000 As you can see, the quality has immediately improved.  00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000 But there are still a lot of parameters with which we can also improve the quality.  00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000 The next important thing is the sub-steps.  00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000 When you increase them, two things happen.  00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000 The simulation will become more accurate.  00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000 Now you are like performing another simulation pass between frames.  00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000 And in the end, the fabric will also become less rigid.  00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000 Because more details will appear and the simulation will be more accurate.  00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000 And the second thing that happens when we increase the sub-steps, the simulation becomes much slower.  00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000 When you start the simulation, you first need to check these two things.  00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000 The sub-steps are now much more accurate.  00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000 And now we can see the simulation with the sub-steps.  00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000 The simulation is much more accurate.  00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000 The simulation is much more accurate.  00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000 And now let's look at some more parameters that are in the Valum Constraints node.  00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000 Now in this parameter we have chosen the Cloth option.  00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000 But you can switch to other types.  00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000 We will deal with many other options later.  00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000 But just so you know, the Valum Constraints node is a container for different types of constraints that can be applied to geometry.  00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000 In this node we have set up the fabric.  00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000 And now the first thing I want to change is the binding to the animation.  00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000 Pin to animation.  00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000 We want to highlight a few points and make them not move.  00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000 It's very easy.  00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000 I will go to the mesh.  00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000 I switch to highlight points and highlight some corner ones.  00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000 I'll take a few here.  00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000 And add them to the group.  00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000 I'll call it pin. You can call it whatever you want.  00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000 And then in the Valum Constraints node I'll select this group of pins.  00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000 And look how they are highlighted in a different color.  00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000 So you understand that they were activated.  00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000 And now in the solver, when I turn on the simulation, they don't move.  00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000 Great.  00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000 And now we can even animate them.  00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000 I'll go back to this group.  00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000 Let's drop the simulation.  00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000 And I'll add the edit node.  00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 We take this group of pins in it.  00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000 I scale and move to the side.  00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000 And I'll add the blend node at the end.  00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000 We will mix the original position and the new one.  00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000 Let's animate.  00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000 I click with ALT.  00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000 I move forward for a couple of seconds.  00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000 And the value is 1.  00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000 Again ALT and click with the left mouse button to set the key frame.  00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000 And in the end we have such an animation for several frames.  00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000 And now we'll see what happens in the simulation process.  00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000 I'll connect.  00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000 I'll go back to the Valum Claws node.  00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000 And in the pin section you need to turn on match to animation.  00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000 And let's run the simulation.  00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000 And we see how the pin constraints are animated.  00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000 And with this you can do a lot more, but we will discuss this in the process of work.  00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000 This is already a good basis for more complex simulations.  00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000 So we continue to discuss the simulation.  00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000 And now we will add the pin constraints.  00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000 And we will add the pin constraints.  00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000 So we continue to discuss the parameters.  00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000 I will return to the Valum Claws node.  00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000 I want to consider three main sets of parameters.  00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000 Stretch, Bend and Rest Length Scale.  00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000 Let's start with stretch.  00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000 These parameters control at what distance points can be removed from each other during the simulation.  00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000 And Bend determines the angle between these points.  00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000 And when you start to change, then you have them changing with a coefficient of 10.  00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000 And stiffness is already as much as possible.  00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000 Stiffness.  00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000 If I turn on the simulation.  00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000 So you see how the stiffness changes.  00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000 And the stiffness changes.  00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000 So you see how much it falls.  00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000 And if I now reduce this value to one, for example, you will immediately see the difference.  00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000 Now it stretches much lower.  00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000 Now I will return the default value.  00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000 And this time the stiffness is already as much as possible.  00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000 And I will change the Bend.  00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000 And to make it more obvious, I will remove the pin.  00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000 I will remove this group.  00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000 And I will turn on the simulation again.  00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000 It will fall down again, as before.  00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000 And the folds around the hand will be quite dense.  00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000 If I now increase the Bend stiffness.  00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000 See what happens.  00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000 The bend becomes more rigid.  00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000 The folds are already more voluminous.  00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000 And the last important parameter in ValumClos is RestLength.  00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000 Length in rest state.  00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000 When you reduce it, it reduces the length of the ribs during the simulation.  00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000 If I change this value to 0.9.  00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000 And in Bend I will return the default value again.  00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000 Now I simulate.  00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000 And see how it will shrink.  00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000 How you can create very interesting effects.  00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000 Especially when you combine them with different fabrics.  00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000 And connect them together.  00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000 By the way, I want to move on to this.  00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000 One of the examples is to connect two pieces of fabric together.  00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000 I'll take the same setup.  00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000 And copy it.  00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000 And I'll copy the grid too.  00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000 Let's reduce this.  00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000 And this too.  00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000 So that their edges touch.  00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000 Something like this.  00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000 I'll reduce the pillars in half.  00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000 So that they are even.  00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000 Let's be 50 and 50.  00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000 In one and the second.  00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000 And I'll make the same thing.  00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000 In one and the second.  00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000 Now you can take this grid.  00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000 I'll move the grid from above.  00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000 I'll highlight the points.  00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000 On the edge.  00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000 And again, I'll group them.  00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000 Again, you can call it whatever you want.  00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000 I'll call it From.  00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000 The same with this grid.  00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000 I'll group this edge.  00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000 And I'll call it To.  00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000 And this is one of the working processes with Vellum.  00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000 When you combine fabrics.  00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000 I'll add Merge.  00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000 Like this.  00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000 And I'll return PinConstrain.  00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000 But of course, you need to update it, because the topology has changed.  00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 This time I'll take these two corners.  00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000 Super.  00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000 No animation needed.  00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000 I'll just skip this node.  00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000 Delete.  00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000 Now after VellumClos, I'll add a VellumConstraints node.  00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000 Here I'll choose Weld Points.  00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000 The type of constraints.  00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000 So, now I have a From group, but I need to change it to Points.  00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000 And a To group.  00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000 And look, I have a To group.  00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000 And I'll change it to To.  00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000 Now we have a seam in the middle.  00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000 If I simulate now.  00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000 It will look like it's one whole fabric.  00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000 One geometry.  00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000 I forgot to change something.  00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000 First, RestLength.  00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000 Let's return it to 1.  00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000 The second is to fix the Pin group again.  00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000 Okay.  00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000 Now it looks like it's one whole fabric.  00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000 And we can roughly see where this line is between them.  00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000 I also want to change the Band.  00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000 Band Stiffness.  00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000 A little less.  00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000 I think it will be better this way.  00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 And now with this setup we can break this geometry.  00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000 VellumConstraints.  00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000 At the bottom we have a Breaking section.  00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000 Here we can set the threshold.  00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000 I'll make it 0.3.  00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000 If the voltage is high enough, the fabric can be broken.  00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000 And I'll change the Band Stiffness.  00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000 If the voltage is high enough, the fabric can be broken.  00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000 Look.  00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000 Super.  00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000 If I change the voltage, it may take a little more time.  00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000 And of course, so far we have a straight line here.  00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000 But you could make it uneven.  00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000 That is, make a more interesting result.  00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000 Well, there are still a few more important parameters that we need to discuss.  00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000 But let's consider this process taking into account our specifics.  00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000 That is, taking into account the creation of the environment.  00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000 Let's start again with a new setup.  00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000 Let's start from the side.  00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000 And this time I'll just start with the line.  00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000 I'll direct it along the x-axis.  00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000 And I'll make it even more interesting.  00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000 And I'll make it even more interesting.  00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000 And I want to move it to the beginning of the coordinate.  00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 I'll take the length.  00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000 I'll insert it into Origin.  00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000 I'll divide it by 2.  00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000 And multiply by minus 1.  00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000 So it will always be at the beginning of the coordinate, regardless of the length.  00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000 And I want to add more points.  00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000 Let it be 50.  00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000 Well, a few meters wide.  00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000 So, since we are doing the overhang, it should be made so wavy.  00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000 This can be done with Wrangler.  00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000 I will use the Sinus function with the number of points.  00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000 If you are not familiar with this function, then here it will simply create such a wavy shape for points.  00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000 And let's say I only want to go along the z-axis.  00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000 This means pi.z.  00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000 Equal.  00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 Or rather, plus equal.  00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000 Because I take the current position.  00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000 And add it to it.  00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000 Next, Sin and number of points.  00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000 And let's see what we get.  00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000 We created such a wavy pattern.  00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000 Only I need to add more functionality.  00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000 I want to change the frequency, so I multiply the number of points by the new channel.  00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000 It will be the frequency.  00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000 And all this in general, we multiply by another channel, which will control the intensity.  00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000 It seems that we have the brackets wrong there.  00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000 Yes, here one is not enough.  00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000 Super.  00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000 Now we can change the intensity and frequency.  00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000 This is great, because now we can change the number of points.  00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000 I think I did it wrong.  00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000 It should be here.  00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000 Yes, exactly.  00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000 In general, we can now change the number of points and we will not spoil anything.  00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000 And then we can change the frequency.  00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 And we can also change the frequency of the current channel.  00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000 And we can also change the frequency of the current channel.  00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000 And then we can change the frequency and intensity.  00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000 And we will keep this beautiful pattern.  00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000 As for the length, I could use many different solutions.  00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000 But one of them is, again, to take Wrangle.  00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000 And here we will set the position on the other side of the curtain.  00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000 Let me first raise these.  00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:19.000 And now in this Wrangle we write, dog P.Y equal and write this new position by Y.  00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000 I will have it as minus 0.2.  00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000 And then we just merge them.  00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000 So we got points on top and bottom.  00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000 Next, we take the Skin node and create a mesh between them.  00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000 Great.  00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 I changed the length to 2 and reduced the intensity a little.  00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000 I think that's enough.  00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000 However, so far this geometry will be difficult to simulate.  00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000 It has no internal breaks, no horizontal ribs.  00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000 Therefore, I will add a polysplit.  00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000 I will press Enter.  00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000 And now here we change to Edge Loop.  00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000 And after that we change the number of loops.  00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000 We do as much as we need to get a good density for simulation.  00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000 That's all. Now I have the basic geometry.  00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000 Next, we need to create constraints.  00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000 I will take the Group node for this.  00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000 And now we need to do this procedurally.  00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000 Therefore, I do not want to manually select points.  00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000 I will use Bounding Region, that is, Bounding Box.  00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000 The height of the box should depend on this line.  00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000 Therefore, we copy its height and insert it into this box.  00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000 Again, the length should be equal to them.  00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000 We take the length parameter and insert it into the Z channel of the box.  00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000 No, sorry, it was necessary to enter in X.  00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000 And now the box will always be the same width.  00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000 Well, let's add a little more.  00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000 So that it exactly captures the entire line.  00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000 On Y, it is not necessary to make it so big.  00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000 The main thing is to capture the upper row.  00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000 And we definitely group the points.  00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:27.120 Now let's obtain the  00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000 conceptき pela.  00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000 Next, create a new material, Vellum Cloth.  00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000 And Vellum Solver.  00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000 And this time we will have animated collision geometry.  00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Just a cylinder.  00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000 Or a sphere.  00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000 And we will have a collision geometry.  00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000 I will choose Mesh or polygons.  00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000 I will reduce the scale.  00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000 And I will turn it a little.  00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000 And I will move it to the side.  00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000 And I will move it to the side.  00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000 And I will move it to the side.  00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000 And I will move it to the side.  00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000 And I will move it to the side.  00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000 And then I animate its movement so that it moves this curtain.  00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000 As if lifting it.  00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000 So, I add a keyframe.  00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000 I lower it.  00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000 Another key.  00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000 Ah, it's trying to simulate.  00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000 I'll go back.  00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000 We will look through this node.  00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000 So, we set the key.  00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000 Now we lift it here.  00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000 Super.  00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000 Now you need to add a pin constrain for the fabric.  00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000 Select the pin group.  00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000 And connect the collision geometry.  00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000 I also want to animate the descent down so that the fabric has a curtain at the bottom.  00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000 I add a transform.  00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000 I'll start here at the top.  00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000 I add a key.  00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000 And then we lower it.  00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:53.000 I'll cancel the simulation for now.  00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000 And we move it down.  00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:05.000 So that it passes through the ground.  00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000 It will pass.  00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000 Now let's see what happens when we simulate.  00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.000 Actually, let's make this first key outside the fabric.  00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:40.000 Better.  00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000 Good.  00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000 The fabric did not move, because we did not turn on match to animation.  00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000 Now it falls down.  00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000 We did not turn on ground plane.  00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000 I turn it on.  00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000 We go to the collisions tab in the solver.  00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:16.000 Here we turn on ground position.  00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000 Great.  00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000 We got such a simple setup.  00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:28.000 Let's consider some more parameters that will help us change this fabric a little.  00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000 I increase the substep to 2 so that the simulation is more accurate.  00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:48.000 And then when we simulate, we will see how small and dense the folds will be.  00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000 This can also be controlled using the thickness.  00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000 I turn on visualization.  00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:04.000 And if we look closer, we can see how dense and thick this fabric is now.  00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000 You can even increase.  00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000 Like this, for example.  00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000 Or like this.  00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:28.000 This can be controlled in a different way, but this is one of the ways.  00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:35.000 As a result, we will have more gaps here.  00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000 Let me increase the substep so that you can see the effect better.  00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000 Here they are now not so dense.  00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000 The next step is to change the mass in the Velum Cloth node.  00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000 There is a mass attribute here at the top.  00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000 So you can increase the overall feeling of weight during simulation.  00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:23.000 If I change it to 1.  00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:34.000 And now, during the simulation, when the force is affected, the fabric behaves as if it has more weight.  00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000 Now let's look at the parameters in Solver.  00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000 There are two important forces that need to be discussed, this is gravity and wind.  00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000 By default, gravity is always with a value of minus 9.  00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000 You can change it, but you have to understand why you are doing this.  00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000 Minus 9 is a realistic result.  00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000 Or rather, minus 9.8.  00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000 It's better to leave it as it is.  00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000 And there is also the wind.  00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000 Here you can set the direction of the wind, say, 1 by z.  00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:17.000 And when I turn on the simulation, the fabric will be blown in our direction.  00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:33.000 We can change this direction, increase or decrease it, depending on how much effect we need.  00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000 Super!  00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000 Before we continue, I would like to make this set more reliable.  00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000 I think it's time to get rid of the topic when we discussed the fabric.  00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000 In this setup, we added the polysplit node.  00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:05.000 And now, if I change the incoming curves, or rather the incoming points on this curve, then our setup will be spoiled.  00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000 Therefore, we need to make this setup more procedural.  00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:16.000 That is, how to make this decision more procedural.  00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000 You could take polyextrude or start from the grid.  00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000 Then we would have about the same result there and there.  00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000 But let's find some new procedural method with polysplit nodes.  00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000 In this node at the top we have the SplitLocations parameter.  00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:46.000 If I remove all this from the parameter and highlight this edge, it will determine where we will have a division.  00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000 Let me reduce them so that you understand what is happening.  00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:57.000 If I highlight this edge, we will have such an expression.  00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000 To be honest, it doesn't mean anything to us.  00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000 It's hard to understand what exactly is happening.  00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:15.000 Instead, let me add a group node.  00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000 Here I will change to edges.  00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:24.000 Now I will highlight this edge and press Enter.  00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000 We will get this group.  00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:35.000 Again, it may be difficult to understand what is written here.  00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000 But there is some logic here.  00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000 Here it is written that the point is 130.  00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000 If we check our line, then here it is exactly 130 points.  00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:56.000 If I change to 100, for example, and repeat this operation, then here it will be written P100, 0.  00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000 Now we understand what number it is.  00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000 It depends on how many points are in this line.  00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:14.000 Instead of leaving this P100, 0, we can copy this parameter and insert it here.  00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:24.000 We need to add the letter P.  00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000 This should be a line.  00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:37.000 Because we add it to the line.  00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000 And at the end we add a defis, 0.  00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000 In the end, we will get the same result, but it is procedural.  00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000 Therefore, if I change the line, this group will automatically be updated.  00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000 This is great, because now PolySplit will work procedurally.  00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000 If it is with the same line.  00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000 But before I continue, let me explain what these return check marks are.  00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:13.000 If I remove them, then it will not work, because the parameter now does not understand that this is an expression.  00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000 If I return these return check marks again.  00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000 Not even two, but one is enough.  00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:31.000 Now the parameter understands that this is an expression that needs to be performed.  00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000 Now we go to PolySplit.  00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000 You can copy all this expression.  00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000 And insert it here.  00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000 Now if I change the incoming points, PolySplit will still work correctly.  00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:01.000 Great.  00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000 Now everything works as we expect.  00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:15.000 Despite the fact that the incoming geometry is changing.  00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000 We also have a group of pins that always selects the upper row.  00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:27.000 So constraints will always be in the right place.  00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000 That's it. This was the first introduction to Wellum.  00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000 If you have never previously considered simulation in Houdini as part of your workflow, especially as an artist in the environment.  00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000 I hope that this has already shown you some possibilities.  00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000 Next, we will consider the constraint stream and create a rope.
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000 We have looked at the fabric, but the Vellum is not only fabric.  00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000 There is much more in this system.  00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000 I very often use Vellum for things like ropes, wire and so on.  00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000 For this, string constraints are used.  00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000 So let's start with a line with several points.  00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000 We start with a line.  00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000 Then add a node to the Vellum Constraints, choosing the type String.  00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000 Then add a Vellum Solver.  00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 Create a line.  00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000 Again, I will direct it along the X axis.  00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000 And do the same thing we did before.  00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000 I will add several points.  00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000 And I want to change the length.  00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000 Okay, then we need a node to the Vellum Constraints.  00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000 Choose the type String.  00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000 And then Vellum Solver.  00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000 Super. Let's raise it.  00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000 I will turn on the simulation.  00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000 And I will add a node to the Vellum Constraints.  00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000 And I will add a node to the Vellum Constraints.  00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000 I will turn on the simulation.  00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000 It will simply fall, because nothing is fixed.  00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000 And instead of highlighting points and creating a group, let's add Wrangle instead.  00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000 In Wrangle we write SetPointGroup.  00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000 This function will take everything that we pass in the arguments.  00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000 That is, the number of points that we indicate in the arguments.  00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000 And add to the group of points that we created here.  00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000 So we need the first entry with geometry.  00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 The group will be called Pin.  00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000 And so far we only need the first point, which has a number 0.  00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000 The state in the group will be equal to 1.  00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000 This means that the group of points will be in the group.  00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000 If there is 0, then we remove the point from the group.  00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000 Now the value is 1.  00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000 And at the end of the operation Set, that is, we set up the group.  00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000 And just to remind you, if you are a total beginner in Vex,  00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000 then you can add a node to the group.  00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000 And then we will add a node to the group.  00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000 And remember, if you are a total beginner in Vex,  00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000 then you can open a reference like this and look at all the arguments here.  00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000 So we put the first point in the Pin group.  00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000 Look, 0.  00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000 It has a value of 1, it means it is in the group.  00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 And we also need the last point.  00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000 This is also easy. We create a new variable.  00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000 I will call it LPLastPoint.  00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000 The last point is Integer.  00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000 And we have already done this with you.  00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000 We have already found the last point.  00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 We take 5.  00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000 This is the total number of points.  00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000 In this case, this is 15.  00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000 14 and the zero point.  00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000 And we write minus 1, because we need the exact number,  00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000 that is, number 14.  00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000 The number of the last point.  00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000 And then the same.  00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000 The same expression, only now  00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000 we replace 0, that is, the number of points, with LP.  00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000 This means we created a Pin group.  00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000 And now in string constraints we can just select this group of pins  00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 and fix it.  00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000 We will have these two final points fixed.  00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000 Two extreme.  00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 This is such a quick way to make a rope.  00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000 But of course, this is only the beginning of the setup.  00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000 What if we want to throw this rope to the ground?  00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000 Let's start here in the side.  00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000 I will cancel the preparation.  00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000 I will remove the pin constraint, we do not need it here.  00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000 And this time instead of the line, let's start with the Draw Curve node.  00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000 I will add a node.  00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000 And I will select the ZX plane.  00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000 I will press Enter in the viewport.  00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000 And with the shift and middle mouse button I will change the size.  00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000 Now I can draw any curve.  00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000 It will be something like a rope.  00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Then I will add Resample.  00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000 So that the points are distributed evenly.  00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000 If you switch to the Saab Div, the curve will be smoother.  00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000 Like this.  00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000 And connect further.  00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000 And now let's raise it up.  00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000 I'll just add Transform.  00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000 And now it will just fall to the ground.  00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000 Yes, let's just activate Ground Plane.  00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000 It turns out, of course, not very realistic.  00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000 It's unlikely it will help us.  00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000 One of the main problems is that all this falls to the ground.  00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000 And the plane is not very smooth.  00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000 One of the main problems is that all this falls the same.  00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000 And at the same time.  00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000 You need to connect correctly.  00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000 Instead of shifting all points to the same position along the Y axis.  00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000 Let's take Wrangle and shift them differently.  00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000 In Wrangle we write the dog P.Y.  00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000 That is, the position is equal to the number of points.  00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000 Of course, now all points will move up along the Y axis.  00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000 So if I turn on.  00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000 They will all fly up.  00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000 And now I will just add a new point.  00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000 And now I will just add a new point.  00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000 And, of course, all points will fly up.  00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000 We add the Fit function.  00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000 And this time it will be taken not Fit01.  00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000 Because our starting range is not from zero to one.  00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000 Therefore, we write Fit and first we indicate this starting range.  00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:36.840 The starting point is from 0 to the last point number, this is 5 minus 1.  00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:47.680 And the target range will be from 0 and then the value of any value you like.  00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.960 I will have it as 1.  00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.480 So they will go down, but they will all have a displacement.  00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.400 If I turn on the simulation, they will again fall to the ground and lie on each other.  00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.120 This distance can be changed using the thickness.  00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.400 And to make it possible to visualize, let me add a sweep.  00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.360 I will choose the round tube shape.  00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.120 And as an up vector, we choose y.  00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.240 Turn off the points attributes.  00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.840 I want quad, but we have some problems here.  00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.400 I think it's okay.  00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.320 In general, everything is fine.  00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.080 Well, then we want to change the thickness.  00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.800 Look, when it falls, they start to intersect like this.  00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.120 We return to the string constraints and where the thickness is, we select calculate varying.  00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.320 And you can visualize it at the same time.  00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.040 So we can see how thick these ropes will be.  00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.160 If I simulate now, they will lie on each other.  00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.540 Super.  00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.160 Well, now with this setup, we can create as many curves as we want.  00:09:25.079 --> 00:09:26.680 You can return to the draw curve node.  00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:32.760 Draw any curve, one on the other, and so on.  00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.560 I will turn on the simulation and they will fall on each other.  00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.900 Super.  00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.199 Well, in general, this setup works, but it turned out, of course, a little boring.  00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.400 What if we make twisted ropes out of them?  00:09:48.319 --> 00:09:51.680 That is, those that are made of three sections, twisted along the entire length.  00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.000 And we already have a sweep node.  00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:55.599 This can be done using this node.  00:09:56.719 --> 00:09:58.479 So we still need a cross section.  00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:01.199 This is just a shape that we stretch along the entire length.  00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.880 Let's start with a circle.  00:10:13.439 --> 00:10:15.359 And I need a copy and transform node.  00:10:22.319 --> 00:10:24.319 I want to turn around the Z axis.  00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.959 I will change the value to 120.  00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:35.520 And now we move the circle like this.  00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:40.319 I will increase the number of copies to 3.  00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.839 As a result, we got such a cross section for the sweep node.  00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.680 I will increase the number of copies to 8.  00:10:56.959 --> 00:11:00.560 Then I will add a transform after that to control the scale.  00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:07.120 And we connect to the cross section slot.  00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:13.920 Here, from the surface surface, we switch to the second input cross sections.  00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.880 Although they turned out to be too big.  00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.040 Here, in this node, you can also reduce the scale of the cross section.  00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:25.920 But I would still like to control it more precisely.  00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.480 Well, in the end, we get what we need.  00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.200 Well, there are several ways to control this result.  00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.200 Let's consider some options.  00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.200 First, we create normals.  00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.840 Then I will increase the number of polygons.  00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.960 Since we are going to twist them, there should be a fairly high density.  00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.440 And then we also change the partial twist.  00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:02.160 This will be the twisting.  00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.040 Just increase.  00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.480 And we will also change the partial twist.  00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.480 And we will also change the partial twist.  00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.480 And we will also change the partial twist.  00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.480 Just increase.  00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.920 I will hide the points and look, we got such a twisted rope.  00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.719 But in this form, the setup turned out to be not very effective.  00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.719 Because of the Resample node that we have before simulation.  00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.680 Of course, we would like to simulate this rope with less points.  00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.439 If I go here, let's reduce.  00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:58.959 Well, it's good that we have a rope with less points.  00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.960 That's good. And we can perform the Resample after simulation.  00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.960 That is, create a rope from this new curve after Resampling.  00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.960 I will hide the points.  00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960 Here.  00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.960 Here we have a small gap.  00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.960 We need to reduce the thickness.  00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.960 And we will fix it.  00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.960 And we will reduce the thickness.  00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.960 And we will fix it.  00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.960 And that's it. Great.  00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.960 We got the ropes.  00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.960 That is, we can simulate how they hang.  00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.960 We can simulate them lying on the ground and so on.  00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960 But when we make our hanging rope, I would not want to make them one by one.  00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.960 But when we make our hanging rope, I would not want to make them one by one.  00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.960 It would be great to find some way to simulate them all at the same time.  00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.960 It would be great to find some way to simulate them all at the same time.  00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960 Let's look at this setup again.  00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.960 Let's look at this setup again.  00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.960 Although, let's start from scratch.  00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960 Why not?  00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960 First, I want to create a surface  00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.960 that will be attached to these ropes.  00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.960 A flat mesh is suitable for this.  00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.960 But of course, it can be any geometry you need.  00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.960 But of course, it can be any geometry you need.  00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960 But of course, it can be any geometry you need.  00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.960 I'll make it smaller.  00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960 Great.  00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960 And I'll move to the left.  00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.960 Next, we need points.  00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.960 It will be easy.  00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.960 We take the scatter node.  00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.960 We take the scatter node.  00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960 Here we have points.  00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.960 Let's make it smaller.  00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.960 I need several of them.  00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.960 The idea is to connect the points  00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960 to the other points on the other side.  00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.960 We need to transform them.  00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960 I will have the same points, but on the other side.  00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:21.960 And then we need the add node, which we already talked about.  00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:31.200 Because the add node can take the points that are in the space and connect them.  00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:42.040 So we have points here.  00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.040 And we have already created points, so here we create polygons.  00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.040 We will do this by the number of points.  00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.040 We can take, for example, 0 and 6.  00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.040 As a result, a line will be created between them.  00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:04.040 And we could continue to add such numbers.  00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.040 And the points will connect.  00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:18.040 You can add several separate polygons, adding a new parameter and choosing other points.  00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.040 But again, we don't want to do it manually.  00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.040 We would like to do it procedurally.  00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:30.040 Therefore, here we go to the By Group tab.  00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.040 And so everything will be united.  00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:40.040 Or you can add the Sort node.  00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.040 And here we sort by the X axis.  00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:50.040 As a result, they will connect like this.  00:16:50.040 --> 00:17:00.040 We will come back and change something here, but let's first add a Resample.  00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.040 And we do what we have already done.  00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:10.040 We take a sphere to group the points.  00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.040 This is so that we can fix the starting points.  00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.040 No, not like that, sorry.  00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.040 From here.  00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.040 I forgot the Copy node. Copy to Points.  00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.040 Like this.  00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:38.040 And now we group by bounding object.  00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.040 Here we select the points.  00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.040 And make it smaller.  00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:57.040 In the Resample node, you need to enable Resample by Polygon Edge.  00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.040 So that we have points at the end.  00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.040 And you need to connect correctly.  00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.040 And now we select the point.  00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.040 And now we have spheres at the end.  00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.040 They are still a little big, we need to reduce.  00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:17.040 So we created a group.  00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.040 And then you need to perform a simulation.  00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.040 I will copy these nodes and insert them here.  00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.040 Don't forget to drop the cache.  00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.040 And now we will add a new node.  00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.040 And now we have a more procedural setup.  00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.040 Now let's try to change how they connect.  00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.040 So that they are not so zigzag.  00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.040 And just opposite each other.  00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.040 To do this, we need to somehow divide the points into two parts.  00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.040 And we will do this in the same way.  00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:55.040 We will add a new node.  00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:02.040 To do this, we need to somehow divide the points into pairs that we want to connect.  00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:15.040 Here, after Scatter, we will add a new attribute.  00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.040 Which we can call later.  00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.040 I will add Wrangle.  00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.040 We will create an attribute ID.  00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.040 And notice, I called it IID.  00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.040 This is so that we have no problem with the ID attribute in Elum Solver.  00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.040 And it will be equal to the number of points.  00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.040 And now when we divide them, these two points will have the same attribute.  00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.040 We go to the Add node.  00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:56.040 And instead of connecting as it is, we change to By Attribute.  00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.040 And we enter that attribute IID.  00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.040 And now we will add a new node.  00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.040 And we will add a new node.  00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.040 And we will add a new node.  00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.040 We enter the value IID.  00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.040 Oh, only need to write correctly.  00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.040 I had a different ID.  00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.040 And now they connect left to right. Just in pairs.  00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.040 Then, we will do the same.  00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.040 It will be great.  00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.040 super  00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.040 What if we want more random connections, not just one to one, opposite each other?  00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.040 We will need to divide them, do like this  00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.040 I'll copy and paste here  00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.040 And now before Wrangle add the Sort node  00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.040 And now we will connect these points randomly  00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.040 Great  00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:14.040 And in the end we have such a good setup, a good basis for creating wires, cables and ropes in our scene  00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:22.040 Let's try to combine what we have already studied and create banners that will hang on these ropes  00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.040 So we have ropes, now we only need grids  00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.040 And now we need to add a new node  00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.040 So we have ropes, now we only need grids  00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:46.040 For this I'll just take Grid, select the right orientation and change the size  00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.040 Something like this  00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.040 Something like this  00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:06.040 I'll just adjust the orientation and move the coordinate to the beginning  00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.040 Super  00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.040 And we need to divide it well, because we will simulate it  00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.040 And now we need to add a new node  00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:42.040 Since we have already created our curves, I want to slightly adjust their orientation, add the Orient and Long Curve node  00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.040 Take these curves, I'll move them below  00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.040 Next, Copy to Points  00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.040 And now we need to add a new node  00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:11.040 We have such banners on each line, of course we don't need so many, we can add Resample  00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.040 Or we can try with the Delete node, let's take it this time  00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.040 Delete by range  00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040 Super  00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:35.040 There are already fewer of them, but again we need to correct the orientation  00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.040 We need to create an up vector  00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.040 Now they are all correctly oriented  00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.040 Next I want to combine them  00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:52.040 How does Vellum work?  00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.040 We create different materials using different constrain nodes  00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.040 And then in these constrain nodes we select a certain geometry group  00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:05.040 So I'll add a group node, call it String  00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.040 I'll leave Primitives for now  00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.040 But then we will most likely need to change it, I will explain why later  00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.040 I'll leave Primitives for now and call it Close  00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.040 And then Merge  00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.040 Then we go to the String Constraints node, we need to connect this third connection  00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:38.040 Here we select the String group  00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.040 That is, these constraints will only be in the String group  00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.040 Next, I will add a new node, Vellum Configure Close  00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.040 Here we select the Close group  00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.040 Now these two groups will be separate from each other with different materials  00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.040 If I run the simulation now, I think you will understand what will happen  00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.040 The String will hang, the fabric will fall to the ground, as we expected  00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.040 And where it caught, but this is not exactly what we want  00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.040 We want this fabric to hang on these ropes  00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.040 And we already know how to do this  00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:30.040 We need the Vellum Constraint Properties node  00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.040 And we need to turn on the Vellum Constraints node  00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.040 And here we select the Vellum Constraints type  00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.040 these are called points  00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.040 Only we need to select the necessary points  00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.040 I'll go back to the original fabric  00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.040 I'll take this point and this point by the corners  00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.040 Add them to a new group  00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.040 You can name them as you wish  00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.040 I'll call it Click 원  00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:23.120 we select this group of pins. Here we select the points, the class pin group.  00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:31.200 It should attach to the rope. If I turn this menu around, I will not have a string option here.  00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:38.040 This is because, despite the fact that primitives are selected here, we still started with the point group,  00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.720 so it is looking for another group. So here you need to change the primitives at the point.  00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:49.800 And then I will also switch to the value of the string at the point.  00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.680 And now I can find this group in the wealth.  00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.880 As a result, we attached them, but they are trying to attach to the closest point. This is the closest point on the line.  00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:08.440 It is to it that the fabric is constrained. This can be changed. Here we have toCloseAsPoint selected.  00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.520 We can turn on the maximum distance.  00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.320 I think this can also be left. And let's see the simulation.  00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.040 Well, it turns out exactly what we expected.  00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.120 However, we have a small problem here, but we will fix it now.  00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.040 As a result, we have such banners on the ropes.  00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.040 You can also add a wind along the x axis.  00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:51.040 And so they will develop slightly.  00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.520 Well, after that, you can add a layer and divide the geometry.  00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.720 We take the string group on one side.  00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.440 And on the other side of the close.  00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.720 I will add a sweep again to give the thickness.  00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.720 And we turn it off.  00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.440 Let me tell you why you need to turn it off.  00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.240 Now we just have the attributes of the point with a curve not set as it should be.  00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.440 Therefore, it is best if the sweep node will create its own, if you did not do it yourself.  00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.920 Therefore, we turn off the transform node.  00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.920 Well, then we merge them.  00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.960 I think you will need to remove this extra fabric.  00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.800 It's not in place here.  00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800 Well, here.  00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.800 Next, we will continue to study different combinations and create several interesting setups.  00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:23.800 As for the valum string and valum close, I think we can finish with them.  00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.800 Next, we will move on to soft, hard bodies.
Translated by the club.  Next we move on to soft and hard bodies.  And by their names, you can already understand what they are.  Soft bodies are plastic, flexible objects that have some mobility.  And as an example, in our scene I want to create a pile of carpets for the market.  And hard bodies will remain hard when interacting with each other or with other objects.  With their help, you can create, for example, fruit and vegetable baskets, or some pile of garbage or other objects.  Let's first consider soft bodies, because it will be easier to configure them.  So, I'll start with the cylinder.  I'll make it about the size of a carpet.  In a few meters.  I'll increase the division.  Since we will simulate it, we need to have enough space for the body.  Since we will simulate it, we need to have enough geometry to make the simulation more accurate.  Well, I think it will be better this way.  And at the end we close the polycap node.  I'll choose the quads.  Well.  And now we will simulate this shape with the help of a vellum.  Let's raise it.  And then I'll add the vellum-strat-soft-body node.  In this setup, we first define this object as a cloth.  And it will have the properties that we expect from it, which we have already considered before.  And then the strat constantly creates internal ribs that help to support and prevent the destruction of objects so that they do not fall and do not shrink.  But at the same time they keep some freedom of action.  And when interacting, these constraints are combined with each other and as a result something more or less organic is obtained.  Then I will add the vellum-sover.  I turn on the ground position.  I will run the simulation.  And it will fall and stay on the ground. Super.  The strat constraints have parameters similar to the fabric parameters.  You can change the length, you can change the rigidity.  I want to increase the rigidity a little.  I want to increase the rigidity a lot.  I change it to 5 and it will be like multiplying by 10.  Not bad.  So far we have only one carpet, but I want to create a whole bunch.  Therefore, I will add a few copy and transform nodes.  First, create a couple of copies along the Z axis.  And then you need another node to raise them.  And I want to turn them.  I will turn it to 90.  And I will place it on top.  You could lay them apart, but we will save time.  Super. Now I simulate.  They will lie on each other, bounce off.  In general, they will interact.  Just note that when we simulate them, they begin to slide.  In this we will look at the parameters in the vellum-solver.  On the force-sets tab we have friction.  These two parameters work together.  If I increase the static threshold, it will affect friction.  I will make 0.7.  Dynamic scale will reduce friction between objects.  I will change it to 0.3 and start the simulation again.  They are still in place and do not slide so much.  It takes a little more time to move them.  Ok.  Simulation is ready.  Everything works fine.  I will just turn on real-time.  But of course they are still low-polygonal.  I would like to create a high-polygonal version.  I will return to the original cylinder.  Of course, it is necessary that the high-poly matches the low-poly.  Because after the simulation we will replace the low-poly with the high-poly.  Now we will start with the mesh.  I will make the same length.  I think it was 2 meters.  It should be long enough to be able to fold it.  I will divide it in the same way.  Since we will be using the same mesh,  we will need to make the same amount of  breaking.  We had 24.  Now in this direction, these are the pillars.  I need so much to get a beautiful cylinder.  When we will fold.  Let's add the bend node.  We need to combine with the direction of the mesh.  I need the X axis.  The length should be the same as the rug itself.  This is 4.  I will make the same length.  I will make the same length.  This is 4.  Then I will shift to start on the edge of the rug.  Now we can increase the bend.  Look, it twists like this.  We need it to really twist,  not just lay down on top of each other.  Therefore, we need to shift the capture direction.  P, Y.  Look, they are curled together like this.  As we wanted.  Super.  Next, I will take the transform node.  I will move the coordinate to the beginning.  And we will check how it matches with the proxy version.  You can press this button Move Centroid to Origin.  And it will be in the beginning of the coordinate.  And let's compare.  Well, almost.  I don't need these rounded ends,  so in Polyfill you need to turn off the deform patch.  When the edges are flat.  Well, let's make it more accurate.  So that they match better.  Here I will reduce the radius.  Super, I think it's not bad.  If anything, we can come back and correct it a little later.  Just need to turn over the normals.  They are directed in the wrong direction.  Well, then we need the point deform node.  And it has three inputs.  Here is the mesh that we deform.  Then the point grid in a state of rest.  And the deformed points.  This is the mesh that we want to deform.  These are the points in a state of rest.  We take from here.  So here we have a proxy version.  And then we take the deformed version of this proxy.  This is the result of simulation.  Yes, we need.  We take the full path.  And use this path,  so that we get the new nodes are gonna work correctly  and you are not looking at the 데 once again for  like listening in the later part.  The next change you will use is red gate program 눌러,  maybe we don't need  the next one acknowledgement V sente.  Yeah, finally.  and now I simulate it super very good, but there are a couple of mistakes  here some strange things are happening too, but we can fix it now  first we go to the point deform node and here we have a piece attribute  we can add a connectivity node and create an attribute  attribute can be any, the main thing is that it helps separate these individual  geometries from each other in this case it will be an attribute class I will leave it like this here too I will write a class  you can at the same time check that the class will coincide with the proxy and the highpoly geometry  in the connectivity node we can  add a new visualizer, call it class and now we see its value  I will do the same on this side, just copy and paste  and if we now compare them, then we will see that the attributes of the same objects coincide,  which means everything is correct and when we return to the point deform and simulate the result should be more accurate  because now the transformation of objects is performed separately, this  transfer from lowpoly to highpoly, but we still have errors  how does point deform work? it moves highpoly points in the same way as lowpoly points  simulated, based on the position of the rest of both objects, and here in the settings we have a radius  if you increase it, then you increase the influence of lowpoly points on highpoly points, and the maximum  number of points is those that are taken into account within this radius, I will increase these two values  and see they begin to shift and smooth out a little, I will also increase the maximum number of points  in general, you can play with these two values ​​and see what you get, how  you can save the shape better and how smooth the result will be,  and at the end I will also add a polyextrude and give it a thickness  let's save the back face output back  and add normal tops to smooth them out  and I want here that it was a soft transition  at the end I will add null, let's look at the final result  fine  also as for the radius and the maximum number of points, since I add polyextrude after  this, here we can slightly balance these two parameters and reduce the artifacts that we  get in the end,  but still some remained  by the way, if you have such bugs in the viewport and you have a set of laps, then here you can  reset the viewport and everything will be fine, okay, these crossings appear because of the polyextrude,  probably instead of extruding outward, you need to do it inside, but I think it will be better  because of this we have changed the direction of the normals, I will  add a clean node,  I will connect here and turn on reverse winding and then add a normal node  so we will update them, that's great  it seems to me great, it would be possible to add even more such carpets, but I think so, too, not bad  if you want to make them softer, you just need to reduce the rigidity of the  strat constraints, here again all the same parameters, if I change it to one,  and now because of the fact that high poly is introduced after simulation, it is still performed very quickly,  we have all these artifacts again, we need to return to the point deform node and try to change the parameters,  and so you can reduce the artifacts,  it seems to me not bad,  but fortunately we only need their final form, if we simulated this and used the whole simulation,  then of course we would have to get rid of the artifacts, but now we are only interested in the final  stage, we just cache them and in this form we will use them, let's move on to the rigid bodies,  we go to the rigid bodies and, as I said, with their help you can fill baskets or boxes with some  objects or vegetables, fruits and so on, and here I created such a procedural box,  here everything is the same as we have already done nothing new, the only difference is that we have  such diagonal boards, and let's go inside and show you how they were made,  here I have the add node again,  and I took the box, removed the upper part,  and then I removed the geometry of the dissolve node, left only the points,  then we take these points and in the add node we connect those that are located diagonally  to each other, just like I have already shown,  then we give the sweep node thickness, the peak node, we move further from the surface and then extrude,  in general, nothing special,  everything is the same as we have already said,  and in the end I get such a box in which you can put vegetables and some other items,  and on the left I have such a pepper that I want to fill this box, you can take any  other object, I decided to choose pepper, I moved the coordinates to the beginning,  I think that you need to increase the scale a little,  and now I will add a standard node to the valum constraints,  and here I will choose the shape match type,  this type of constraints will try to save the shape of the incoming object when simulating it,  we will take the box again, remove this upper face and add a little thickness,  and of course we will not fill it completely, I will take this inner face and raise it a little,  we will fill only this small area, that is, you do not need to take the whole box as a whole,  and now this will be the geometry for collisions,  so we have a collider, there is one pepper, but of course we need to do more,  I will create a cloud of points, but the points from the volume,  if I connect the box here,  here we will have a bunch of points, you can increase the distance, that is, separation and jitter,  so we slightly randomize them,  and then we take the copy to points node,  and now with this you can fill the box, but I would like a little more, I think there are few of them,  less than the distance between the points, for example,  and move them up so that they then fall into the box,  so good,  and then we need a volume solver, this time it will be slower,  but I think not so much.  As with soft bodies, we do not need the simulation itself, we just need its result,  that is, you don't even need to bring it to the end, just wait until they stop and  lay down more or less as you like, I think it's not bad, and then we will combine with the box  and we will get a box with peppers, the distance looks very good,  but you probably noticed that some of them slightly flattened,  we could turn around and increase the rigidity, the multiplier is already maximum,  but you can make 100, for example, or even more, and again simulate,  gorgeous,  but again, we have somewhere some objects intersect with each other or deform,  and to fix this, you can do a couple of things,  firstly, in the initial setup, they already intersect slightly before the start of the simulation,  this happens due to the distance between the points due to randomization, it is too strong,  you need to make sure that there is less penetration immediately,  they should not intersect, and let's also increase the separation point,  then there will be less peppers, some can fall out of the box, but it's okay,  we can fix it later, now at the beginning they do not intersect, this is much better,  then in solver we increase the sub steps,  and also increase the collision passes, this means that in simulations collisions will be checked more often,  and then in valum constraints we increase the stiffness,  I will make the value 150,  for example,  I think that these three things will give us a good result, let's see the simulation,  probably need to raise it higher so that we do not have problems with the box,  so they will not intersect,  so it's better,  but it's okay,  okay, it seems to me that it's better, but it's true that somewhere else it can be seen that some of them are slightly compressed,  but you can consider that we have already done most of the part, then we need to fix this deformation,  I will add the valum transform pieces node,  the first two inputs we pass the result of the valum simulation, I will just reset it first,  the first input and the second,  the last input we pass the input geometry, for example, the point deform node, I will add the connectivity node,  because the valum transform pieces is also looking for an attribute,  that is, the attribute of these separate elements is a piece,  I will call it class,  and now I will turn on the solver and simulate,  now let's look through the valum transform pieces,  we will find places where they are slightly compressed,  and we will also see how the valum transform pieces look like,  now we will see how the valum transform pieces look like,  and now we will see how the valum transform pieces look like,  and now let's look through the valum transform pieces,  we will find places where they are slightly compressed,  I will switch and compare the result,  notice we returned the volume,  so we fixed even the most strongly deformed objects,  because now we take the orientation and the result of the simulation from the valum solver and replace the original geometry,  just using this node transform pieces,  super,  and in the end we got a setup that we can connect a box of any size,  let's reset,  and now we will take the original box and increase it a little,  notice that more peppers appear at once,  let's make it smaller on the contrary, so that the simulation is faster,  now let's throw the box,  and now we can add more items,  great,  and of course you can remove those that you don't like, some extra,  or you can add more,  because we see the bottom here,  and we could add others on top to close this bottom,  or add more falling objects,  it's easiest to increase the scale of the box before it is transferred to the points from volume,  I will return to the points and add the transform node,  and here I will simply increase the scale,  and in the end I will have more peppers,  super,  well, let's finish on this,  and in the next lesson we will continue and start creating markets,  and then we will also consider different ways to fill them with what we have already created, 
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000   00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000   00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000   00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000 I will place the coordinate at the beginning  00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000 I will block these channels so that it always remains at the beginning of the coordinate  00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000 And now when I will interactively change it, it will remain in the center  00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000 And now let's change some parameters  00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000 And now we are talking about the size of the counter  00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000 I will make it a couple of meters high  00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000 And wider  00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 Now I want to divide this box into parts  00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 I will divide the box into parts  00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000 Because on the sides we will have just a frame and a fabric on top  00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Let's divide it  00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000 Since this input box will not change, it is not necessary to do this as procedurally as possible  00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000 When we will break it  00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000 But just in case, since many of this will depend on the number of points or the number of primitives  00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000 I want to add a sort node just in case  00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000 So that we are sure that they will not change for sure  00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000 Sorting along the y-axis  00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000 Good  00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000 Then the first thing we will do is a visor on top  00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000 We need to isolate the upper face  00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000 It would be possible to add a blast node, but let's use Wrangle instead  00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000 And now this action can be done with just one line of code  00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000 Just delete the primitive  00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000 To do this, just write removePrim, then the geometry input and the primitive number  00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000 And then the number that says whether it is necessary to delete the points or not  00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000 This is 1 or 0  00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000 And so we just delete this primitive  00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000 But we actually don't want to delete it  00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000 We want to delete everything else except it  00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000 We could add an if here  00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000 If the number of points is not equal to 5  00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000 Then delete this primitive  00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000 And then the number of points is not equal to 5  00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000 And so we delete this primitive  00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 And here we replace the number of primitives  00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000 And here, sorry, not the points, but the primitives, because we are overriding the primitives  00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000 And so we deleted everything except this primitive  00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000 But this can be done even easier  00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000 We leave the first starting line and delete the points  00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000 But instead of determining here what primitive we want to delete, let's use the group field  00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000 Write not 5, that is, everything is deleted except the fifth face  00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 In general, this is several different ways to do the same  00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000 I think it will be better this way  00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000 And so we have such a rectangle  00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000 And since I will simulate it, it needs to be divided more  00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000 You can again add the subdivide node  00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000 But instead I will take polysplit  00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000 Since this incoming geometry will not change, you can switch to edge loop  00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000 And select one of the edges  00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000 Let's do this  00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000 And now you need to connect the number of loops with the size of this box  00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000 In my opinion, this is this axis  00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000 Copy the parameter  00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000 I put it here  00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000 And multiply it by something  00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000 If I multiply by 5  00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000 Then when I replace this one  00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000 Everything works fine  00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000 Now I will add another polysplit  00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000 And now I will choose another edge  00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000 This one  00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000 Let's see if it will work  00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000 Yes, it also works fine  00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000 But now we multiply not by 5, but by 8 more  00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000 Or maybe leave 5  00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000 And here 4  00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000 Or maybe a little more  00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000 But it will work fine  00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000 As a result, we got an even number of faces on top  00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000 Next I want to add extruding on the sides  00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000 And group the edges  00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000 Fine  00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000 Why is this necessary?  00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000 If I add a polyextrude, just as it is  00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000 And connect it like this  00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000 I can't extrude in the right direction  00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000 Without defining the edges first  00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000 So we first create a group  00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000 I call it Edge  00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000 Sometimes I call it Bound, just to understand what it is for  00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000 And now we select the Edge group  00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000 And here is the primitive EdgeNormal mode  00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000 And we get the right direction  00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000 I want to make it outside  00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000 And also select Individual Elements  00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000 So it will look like this  00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000 If I leave everything as it is and then simulate  00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000 Each part on the sides will be a separate element  00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000 It will work fine for me, so I will leave everything as it is  00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000 But you can combine them with the Fuse nodes later  00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000 But if we want to make them longer, we need to divide them more  00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000 So we can combine these two elements  00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000 Like this, for example  00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000 And now if you extrude further, the division changes  00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000 Great  00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000 And I will leave it like this  00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000 And after that I will add Subdivide  00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000 Because I need enough geometry for simulation  00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000 So I will leave the option OpenSubdivBi-Linear  00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000 It will look like this  00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000 And before simulating, I want to fix some points  00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000 Again, we create a sphere and copy it to the geometry points  00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000 We have already done it several times, so I think you can easily repeat it  00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000 The Wennoh datafile will be on the sizzling scene  00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000 Heat OF given material will issue different bits  00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000 This will help you to tune the confession  00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000 Now we have the Pin group  00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000 Next we add Velum Cloth as we did before  00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000 PlusOver  00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.880 россий  00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.100 you  00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.620 the steps will increase to 2  00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:04.200 we secure the group with aong clothes  00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.840 super we got this rising  00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.840 If you want, you can divide it more.  00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.840 Just need to go back to the beginning and check that everything works procedurally.  00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.840 If I increase this weight and simulate again, let's see what happens.  00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840 Yes, great.  00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:37.840 Everything works great and will work when we change something at the input geometry.  00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840 Great.  00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.840 We can consider that we have finished with the weight.  00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.840 Next, let's do the frame of the bench.  00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.840 I will return to the original geometry again.  00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.840 Let's make it not just so flat from the flat boards that will stand on the sides.  00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.840 Let's make them crosswise.  00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.840 I'll just reset everything again and return it as it was.  00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.840 You can even make a simple cube.  00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.840 Now I want to highlight the points, so that the frame of the bench is not so flat.  00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.840 Now I want to highlight the points and connect them as we did before.  00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.840 Points can be separated from the Dissolve node.  00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.840 Just turn off Remove Unused Points.  00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.840 Although again, all this can be done in one wrangler.  00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.840 I can delete all primitives and leave only points.  00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.840 Done.  00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.840 We only have points left.  00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.840 And in the next wrangle, let's connect them.  00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.840 This is again one of the ways to do it with a wrangle.  00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.840 First, set a group of points.  00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.840 So, in the end, I have a group A and in the middle of it I have a group B.  00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.840 I will use the same group A to connect the points.  00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.840 I will also connect the points to the Dissolve node.  00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.840 I will also connect the points to the Dissolve node.  00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.840 I will connect the points to the Dissolve node.  00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.840 So, in the end, I have a group A and in it there is one zero point.  00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.840 And we do the same for all the others.  00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.840 I want to connect 0, 2 and 3.  00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.840 And then I will do the same with the rest of the groups.  00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.840 So, 2 and 1.  00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840 So, 0 and 3.  00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.840 And I will connect the points to the Dissolve node.  00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.840 And I will connect the points to the Dissolve node.  00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.840 And I will connect the points to the Dissolve node.  00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.840 So, 0 and 3.  00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:16.840 2 and 1.  00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.840 4 and 7.  00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840 And 6 and 5.  00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840 Then the Add node.  00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.840 Go to the Polygons and By Group tab.  00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.840 And here we select Each Group Separately.  00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.840 Each group separately.  00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.840 We enter these groups and we are done.  00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.840 It was one of the ways to do it.  00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.840 But instead of writing all this here, we could just create a group.  00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.840 To make it easier to understand, we can use the same method.  00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.840 We can create groups.  00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840 Add another Wrangle.  00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.840 And instead of all this, we just add primitives to the AddPrim function.  00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.840 So, AddPrim.  00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.840 We indicate the input with geometry.  00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.840 That is, what exactly we want to connect.  00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.840 Then what we want to add.  00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.840 This is Poly, Polyline.  00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.840 And there are several more options.  00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.840 You can look at them in the description.  00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.840 I need Polyline.  00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.840 And then the points that we want to connect.  00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.840 This is again 0 and 3.  00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.840 As a result, we will get a new primitive that connects these two points.  00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.840 We do the same with all the other points.  00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.840 And this is how I connected all the points.  00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.840 However, if I show the numbers of primitives in this way,  00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.840 we will have a lot of numbers that are being added.  00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.840 I will add PolyPath to correct this.  00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.840 Now everything is neat.  00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:22.840 Therefore, I will leave the second option.  00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.840 This one can be deleted.  00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.840 After PolyPath, I will add Mountain.  00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.840 We just add a little noise.  00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.840 In general, before this, I will add Resample.  00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.840 This is, of course, too much.  00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:52.840 And then Sweep node.  00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:04.840 And then I will add a new node.  00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.840 And then I will add a new node.  00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.840 And then I will add a new node.  00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:17.840 And then I will add a new node.  00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.840 And then I will add a new node.  00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.840 At the end, I will just add a grid grid.  00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.840 Then we will get such rounded edges.  00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.840 I will reduce the radius a little.  00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.840 And now you can combine everything.  00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.840 And the result will be even better.  00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.840 In general, it would be nice to add them in simulation  00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840 as a collision geometry.  00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.840 I think it's better.  00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:10.840 Great.  00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.840 The base is already there.  00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:25.240 vibration or it works very slowly, then in the Vellum Solver you can increase the velocity damping on the power tab.  00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.720 I think it's not worth increasing to 1, but I'll just show you as an example, everything will immediately slow down.  00:19:36.879 --> 00:19:44.000 But I think it's quite enough 1.10 or 2, just a little bit, just to slightly slow down this  00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.680 movement at the end so that it is not continuous throughout the entire simulation and you see they start to stop.  00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.040 So that was one example, let's go back again and test it.  00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.680 I'll try to change the size.  00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.400 I think it's great.  00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.440 Well, now let's try to create another shape for the weight.  00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:25.840 This time we can start with a triangle, not a square.  00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.600 To do this, I will first take a circle.  00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.560 Align it along the grid and change it to the polygons.  00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.040 Only you need to turn it over.  00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.480 And three sides.  00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.520 Super.  00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.080 Well, let's increase it a little.  00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.640 One meter is not enough.  00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.280 I also want this weight to not be the same height over the entire length.  00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.680 I want the front part to be higher than the back.  00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.760 For this we use the operator if.  00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.600 Although again, it would be possible to take the edit node.  00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:34.560 And although it cannot be said that this is exactly a procedural method, but with the edit node it would be possible to  00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.639 edit it like this, and then add another edit node.  00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.879 And raise the back part.  00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.639 And you keep this editing.  00:21:53.639 --> 00:21:58.040 You can change the parameters here and the front and back parts will always move.  00:21:59.639 --> 00:22:01.960 That is, partially this is a procedural method.  00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.440 But instead, let's still do it in Wrangler.  00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.720 Here I want to use the operator if.  00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.280 And we will also use logical operators.  00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:21.320 Write if dog-pity-nam is equal to 2.  00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.200 This is one of the points in front.  00:22:26.399 --> 00:22:27.720 This is it.  00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.840 Here we have 2 and 1.  00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:38.399 If dog-pity-nam is equal to 2 or dog-pity-nam is equal to 1.  00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.760 Then I want to create a channel.  00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.720 dog-p.y plus equal.  00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.720 I will call the channel front-height.  00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:09.480 And now I will have such a channel with which I can adjust the height of the front edge.  00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.440 We will do the same with the back point.  00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.960 And now we will have a channel with which we can adjust the height of the front edge.  00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.480 And now we will have a channel with which we can adjust the height of the front edge.  00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.240 And now we have parameters for controlling the height.  00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240 Front and back.  00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.879 I will just slightly raise the back above the ground.  00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.639 And now I can move the front and back points separately from each other.  00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.480 And I don't need a polysplit, just add a subdivide.  00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:48.760 This is how we get quad, which we can then easily simulate.  00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.760 I'll make it bigger.  00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.040 You can also do it like this.  00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.240 Next, we will copy this setup again.  00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.520 That is, we do the same.  00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.920 I will copy and paste for this weight.  00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.240 I will copy and paste for this weight.  00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.160 We take the pin group from here.  00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:17.680 Front subdivide.  00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.920 And then there will be a new frame for the collision geometry.  00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.560 Let's check the simulation for now.  00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.280 It seems to be fine.  00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.840 Not enough extrude, let's take it from here.  00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640 And add it here.  00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.920 Only at the output, I don't want them to be separate from each other, so I'll add a fuse.  00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.360 Well, that's great.  00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.040 Let's increase division.  00:25:12.479 --> 00:25:14.719 I think you can even do it better this way.  00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.399 Maybe I can petrify this style better.  00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:39.240 Great.  00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.080 So we got a triangular weight.  00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:48.959 And now let's not do the intersecting frame  00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:51.280 with intersecting posts anymore.  00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.360 Let's just make straight ones.  00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.719 So here we have a fabric.  00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:07.680 And we need another such geometry on the ground.  00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.600 And then we connect them together.  00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.040 I'll take Wrangle again.  00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.040 In general, you can copy this one.  00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.520 However, the order of the points has changed, so here you need to correct.  00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:18.680 The rest of the setup can also be copied.  00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:31.680 And connect here.  00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.720 Here, ready.  00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:55.080 So, and now we have two different weights.  00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.160 Although it would be possible to make this one more stable.  00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:05.760 It would be possible to add some kind of frame and try to do it in different ways.  00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.000 Connect these points with some kind of board.  00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.400 And these.  00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.640 Let's add some sticks with a rope instead.  00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.160 They will be like supports.  00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:24.000 And to determine the positions of these sticks, we will take the original circle again.  00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.640 I'll just add a polyextrude.  00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.960 And so I'll move it out.  00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:44.000 Well, and again, so that it turns out as it should, I need the edges on the edge.  00:28:44.000 --> 00:29:05.440 Super.  00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.840 We remove the inner edges with the Divide node.  00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.640 In general, since we only need points, we could remove everything except the points from the polyextrude.  00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.320 Remove everything except the third, fifth and fourth.  00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.600 Let's continue.  00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.600 Let's just look at different ways to do the same thing.  00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:45.360 I will add Orient and Long Curve to fix it normally.  00:29:53.159 --> 00:29:54.240 And now I will create supports.  00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.399 I have already created this before, but here it's just a cylinder with a torque.  00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.040 And I will copy it to these points.  00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.840 And in the end we have such sticks or pegs.  00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:24.840 Next, you need to add ropes.  00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:31.360 First you need to find the point where the rope will go.  00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.240 These are the points.  00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.639 And then you need points on the other end of the rope.  00:30:40.639 --> 00:30:42.479 These are the ones.  00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.399 Or more precisely, even these.  00:30:52.959 --> 00:30:54.520 Let's take another Wrangle.  00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:58.399 Next, Merge.  00:31:01.399 --> 00:31:03.399 No, sorry, not those.  00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:04.399 These ones.  00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:11.399 We merged these points and then we connect them in Wrangle.  00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.840 That's it for the next round.  00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.840 Super.  00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.520 Cheers, friends!  00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:50.280 Then PolyPass for cleanup and Resample.  00:31:50.280 --> 00:32:02.360 I also want to shift the base point to the height of this Tor.  00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.080 I want them to be at the same height.  00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.960 Let me find this position.  00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.640 This is this center.  00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:33.720 Great.  00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.920 And then we perform Vellum simulation,  00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.720 just like before.  00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.920 I need a group that will become a rope.  00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.800 This is the String group.  00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.640 And a cloth group.  00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:18.080 Then we add Vellum constraints.  00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:24.000 Only first you need to add Merge.  00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:42.680 You just need to check that everything is correct here.  00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:51.880 Type String and String group.  00:33:51.880 --> 00:34:03.760 Then we also connect the pegs here.  00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:07.000 Then you need to fix the points.  00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.520 Again, we take the same setup.  00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:34.120 Let's check that everything is fine.  00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:40.600 And let's simulate.  00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:46.719 Super.  00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:48.199 Now we have such ropes.  00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:53.319 Only my points did not shift as I wanted.  00:34:53.319 --> 00:34:54.359 Let's see why.  00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.560 This is because here we are processing primitives.  00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.920 And we don't have primitives at all.  00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.920 I will add a new Wrangle.  00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:19.880 After all this.  00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:26.640 And this should only affect the lower points.  00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.080 This is 1, 2 and 0.  00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:45.160 And this is how we fixed them in place.  00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.359 And in the end I want to increase the thickness of the rope.  00:36:04.799 --> 00:36:27.520 And we have strong contrast here.  00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:32.640 So everything is fine.  00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640 You can't change the overall thickness here.  00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.120 separate setups that allow you to create the weights of two different forms and styles.  00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:45.520 Of course, you can go even further, you can combine something, you can divide them,  00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:51.600 divide them into parts, some of these fabrics can be hung on ropes or tied together,  00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:58.680 but I think that you already know enough to do this yourself, create a tent of any form.  00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:06.200 But at the end, let's add the countertop itself and lay out some items on it so that it  00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:15.919 really looks like a shopping counter. Let's add here. Let's take the same original geometry again.  00:37:22.359 --> 00:37:26.720 So we take this original box, but we need to change it.  00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:38.120 And it will be easier if we copy it and then use the links to the channels.  00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:48.440 But in the end, everything will be controlled by one original box. We take the x and z coordinates from the original box.  00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.319 I want to block these channels, that is, leave them blocked,  00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:05.040 but we will change the parameter y, because the height of this countertop must be made smaller.  00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.560 Something like that, if something can be changed later. And the countertop itself should not be wider than the  00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:21.880 weight, than these racks. Therefore, we take this link to the channel and subtract a small value from it, say 0.2.  00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.200 And here too 0.2.  00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.040 Just so that it fits between the racks. You can even a little more.  00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.280 So great. So in the end we have a box with which we start and then do the same.  00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.880 Separate the top from the side and we will process them separately.  00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.040 We will copy the setup in which we separate the upper face.  00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:04.320 I also need the split field, so I'll take three nodes.  00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.680 Everything starts exactly the same.  00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:22.359 Only here you need to check the links. The parameters must be associated with this second box.  00:39:22.359 --> 00:39:31.520 So in the end we got such boards for the upper part. Then I will add a bevel so that there are gaps between them.  00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:41.200 As an option, you could use the PolySplit and CycleFourage node. Well, you can do it.  00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:52.160 Next, I will add PolyExtrude.  00:39:52.160 --> 00:40:01.120 We add thickness. And at the end I will add another bevel, but for now I will leave it as it is.  00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.759 Let's work with the side sides.  00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.160 You can add another Wrangle.  00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:25.680 And here we remove the upper and lower face, this is 5 and 0.  00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:40.560 Now you need to create legs. Instead of removing the points and connecting them again, you can highlight these ribs.  00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.160 And use the Dissolve node, again, because the input geometry will not change.  00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.160 This means that the number of primitives and the order of points will not change.  00:41:04.759 --> 00:41:08.160 Next, I will add Ollipass for the cleanup.  00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:20.160 I will add a Sweep node to add thickness.  00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:39.040 Here is one polygon, close it and merge everything again.  00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:41.040 Great.  00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:47.920 And again, as in the last time, you could add a wooden finish at the bottom.  00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:53.920 But we have already done this, so I will not show it, I think you can do it yourself.  00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.920 For now, I will leave everything as it is.  00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:06.920 And then we start with another box.  00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:11.800 Again, we do the same, refer to the original box and read a little.  00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:24.800 You could take a Transform and scale it, but then we would have to use a certain percentage of the total value,  00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:30.800 and not some absolute distance between the edge and the new position of the points.  00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:47.800 And now, if I replace this box, or rather this original one,  00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:55.800 everything else will also always change and remain at the desired distance from the edge of this box.  00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:03.800 And when scaling, when we increase the scale, they would be either further or closer when scaling.  00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.800 So it's better this way.  00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.680 And then Bevel.  00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.680 And at the end we correct it normally.  00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.680 And we have a table.  00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.680 I will make the legs thicker.  00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.680 And at the end, let's go back to the scattering process.  00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.680 I have such pots that I want to lay out on the counter.  00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.680 But first you need to process them.  00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.680 This is where they come from.  00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:54.680 They need to be prepared for the next step.  00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.680 And then we will start to make the legs.  00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.680 And we will start to make the legs.  00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.680 And we will start to make the legs.  00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.680 And we will start to make the legs.  00:44:02.759 --> 00:44:04.759 This is where they come from.  00:44:04.759 --> 00:44:06.759 They need to be prepared for the scattering process.  00:44:08.759 --> 00:44:10.759 To begin with, you need to move them to the beginning of the coordinate.  00:44:15.759 --> 00:44:17.759 We take the cycle ForEach, ForEachConnectedPieces.  00:44:22.759 --> 00:44:24.759 I will call the attribute Pots.  00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.840 Later, we will need this attribute when we scatter.  00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.840 With the attribute fromPieces.  00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.840 Then the transform node.  00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.840 We return them to the beginning of the coordinate.  00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:04.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:16.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.840 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.920 And we start to make the legs.  00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.920 And we will start with an alpha.  00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:40.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.920 보면  00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.920 And we will start to make the legs.  00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:57.920 and the node attribute from pieces  00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.560 Next I need a set of geometry and clouds  00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:15.440 Geometry is our pots pots  00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.760 We take the cloud from here  00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.760 I need only the top face of the table  00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:27.760 I think it's here  00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.040 in front of the polysplit  00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.040 that is, the polysplit is no longer needed  00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:39.040 let's take it from here  00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:46.320 I will change the coverage to 1  00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000 and method byPointSpacing  00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.240 now I will reduce the spacing  00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.760 like this for example  00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.440 look, these turned out to be at the very edge  00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:07.440 if I take copyToPoints  00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:14.440 connect geometry  00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:26.080 and enter the attributes Pots  00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.280 and so they all copy in turn  00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.840 but we do not want to influence the PScale  00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.880 we go to the attributes tab  00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:41.880 and here we turn off the PScale  00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.880 and now you can adjust the spacing  00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:51.880 so that they are at a normal distance from each other  00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.880 in the attribute from pieces node  00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.880 let's try not cycle, but random  00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:03.880 and as I said, some of them are at the very edge  00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.960 let's move them a little closer  00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.800 closer to the middle  00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:15.800 add the Extrude field  00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.840 create an Inset  00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.200 and remove the sides of the side  00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.080 as a result, we will have a small space between the edge of the table and these objects  00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:32.880 and then let's merge everything again  00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.880 we still need to take into account the height of the table, we need to shift them  00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:43.120 it will be easy  00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:50.120 add another Wrangle  00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:59.080 Extrude value we take from here  00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.880 and here we write P.Y plus equal to this distance  00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:10.880 as a result, they will shift higher  00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:15.880 and as a result, we got a table that we filled with objects  00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:20.880 let's merge everything again  00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:23.880 key  00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.880 and we got such a table  00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.880 key  00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.880 and we got such a table  00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.880 if you don't like the size or shape, it's easy to change  00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:46.880 and you can also easily make a triangular table  00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.880 great  00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.880 let's move on to the next object  00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.880 let's create a table  00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.880 great  00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:12.880 we can go even further and randomize P.Scale  00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.880 with the Atrip Randomize node  00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.880 somewhere here, for example  00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:23.880 and now in the Scatter and Align node we can slightly randomize the orientation  00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:28.880 and everything is ready  00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.880 let's finish on this  00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:38.880 let's see what objects I created for the final scene  00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.880 look, here we have a table with a table  00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.880 and a table with a table  00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:47.880 let's see what objects I created for the final scene  00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:51.880 look, here we have a triangular table  00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.880 there is also fabric on the floor, it's like a rug  00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:58.880 and scattered objects  00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.880 then boxes, as we did with you  00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:04.880 there are also objects inside  00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.880 again, the rugs  00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.880 and some of these tables are tied with ropes to the support  00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.880 you can try this option if you want  00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:24.880 but of course you don't have to create these tabs for your scene  00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.880 but I think they can be useful to you in some other projects  00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.880 so it's useful to know how to create them  00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:40.880 as a homework this week, try different simulations and combinations of Valum  00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.880 which can be useful to you when creating some trade shelves, for example  00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.880 or objects, especially if they are needed for your scene  00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.880 or maybe they can be useful to you in some other projects  00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.880 we finished this week  00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.880 and next we will continue to study procedural working processes  00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.880 and create other elements of our city
