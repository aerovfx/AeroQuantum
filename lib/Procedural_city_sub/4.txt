WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.400 This week is dedicated to preparing the stage for our city.  00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.240 We will need to add ground plains, add background,  00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.360 proxy buildings, river and main focus point.  00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.040 I have this temple.  00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.160 And it will be necessary to create a camera movement.  00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.840 All these steps are important in their own way, but the most important  00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.120 is the placement of the camera and its movement.  00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.120 Because it depends on what we will see at the end and how close  00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120 we will see it.  00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.800 This also allows us to understand what we need to focus on  00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.240 and at an early stage determine whether what we imagined  00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.120 is in line with the final shot or not.  00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.959 And whether what we created will work.  00:00:55.959 --> 00:01:01.440 But to create a context, of course, you need to create something  00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.320 that the camera could look at.  00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.240 And this week we will start with the landscape and the highlands  00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.240 in Houdini.  00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.479 And then we will also work with Gaia.  00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.240 This is a separate program for creating terrain.  00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.880 Quad Spinner program.  00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.280 But since this is primarily a course on Houdini, you are probably  00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.560 wondering why we are talking about Gaia.  00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.080 Well, there are two reasons.  00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.840 The first is that we have already told in detail about the  00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.199 highlands on the course on creating a environment.  00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:40.280 And this week we will also have a rather detailed lesson  00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.960 dedicated to the highlands.  00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:46.119 Well, the truth is that it will be less detailed than on that course.  00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.679 The second reason is that Gaia is generally a great  00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.399 program and it works very well.  00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.839 If you are familiar with programs like Substance Painter,  00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:04.360 Marvel's Designer or Sp3, then you will understand that Gaia is very  00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.280 similar to these programs.  00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.799 And it also copes with tasks that are usually considered  00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.280 somewhat complex and complicated, such as modeling  00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.440 fabrics, creating sheets, creating terrains and so on.  00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.800 Here it is done much easier and more convenient.  00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.680 Of course, the highlands are also a very good tool,  00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.840 especially given that they are integrated in Houdini.  00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.360 And over time, I think they will only improve.  00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.800 But at the moment, Gaia has a lot of advantages.  00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.080 She is very fast, very high quality, she is cheap  00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.600 and it is very convenient to work with her.  00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.720 So, having studied the creation of the landscape, we will move on to  00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.080 setting up this landscape in Houdini.  00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.520 We will make a blockout of our scene, add a proxy building,  00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.560 a proxy geometry and animate the camera.  00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.080 At this stage, we will talk about what we are actually  00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.400 achieving when we set up these cameras.  00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400 Okay, let's get started.
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.000 So we go to the landscape and layout  00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:13.480 It should be noted that in Houdini there are excellent tools for creating landscapes, the main ones of which are the fields of heights  00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.240 They have their pros and cons and the pros are most often much overlaid by the cons  00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.120 This lesson will be a kind of general review of how to work with the fields of heights in Houdini  00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:36.520 In the first lesson I already said that in our course on creating an environment, we have been analyzing the fields of heights and creating landscapes for a whole week  00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.520 Of course, I cannot assume that everyone who is watching this course has already passed it, so now we will also briefly consider the fields of heights  00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.520 Let's discuss what the fields of heights are and how we are going to use them  00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.519 The fields of heights  00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.519 I usually start with one of two methods  00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.520 Sometimes it is already a finished landscape design or a draft layout from the layout project  00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.520 Sometimes I create it myself, just using the edit node and throwing in such draft forms  00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520 It can be even just a few primitives combined together  00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 The fields of heights  00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920 The fields of heights  00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.920 Another method is the heightfieldnoise node  00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.920 Before we start to consider the field of heights, we need to say that we have a heightfield node  00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.920 Here we have grid spacing, this is the resolution, the uniform scale and the size  00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920 This is how you decide how big the field will be  00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.320 The initial size 1000x1000 gives a more predictable result, so I always try to stick to this size  00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320 At least for the calculation of erosion that we can perform later  00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.320 If you need to create a landscape so quickly and easily, you can use the heightfieldnoise node  00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.320 In general, the fields of heights in the Houdini are a whole separate set of nodes  00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720 There are a lot of them here  00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720 I need the heightfieldnoise  00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720 It is very similar to the mountain node  00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.720 Here are even very similar parameters  00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.720 If I return to the heightfield node and change the grid spacing here, you will see how the resolution changes  00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.720 And if I click on the middle button on the node, you will see how many voxels we have  00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.720 Consider that voxels are like points that make up this grid  00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.720 And they have a size that can be changed  00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.720 The higher the resolution, the more time it takes to create  00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.720 Thus, you can create very interesting shapes using just heightfieldnoise  00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.720 And of course, there is also amplitude and size, as usual  00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.720 The most interesting is the post-processing and distortion tab  00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720 In the hightfieldnoise node, you can even change the type of noise that is used to create a landscape  00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.720 Now it is sparse convolution, the simplest  00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.720 If you need something more complex, more similar to mountains or stones, you can try these, like Cellular  00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.720 And these ones especially  00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.720 Look, if you add erosion here, you will get very interesting rocks  00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.120 But for now, I will leave sparse convolution and we will analyze post-processing parameters  00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.120 Here you can use fold or complement  00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.120 Look what happens  00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.120 And it turns out something like a hill area  00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.120 You can use this to create a mountain, for example, its footpath  00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.520 If you turn on both, you will get something like sand dunes  00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.520 If you have already used the Mountain node in Houdini, you know how to use these parameters  00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.520 You can turn on the lattice warp and create such organic shapes  00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.919 This is something more similar to the patterns on glaciers in rocks  00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.919 And also interesting shapes can be created if you turn on the gradient warp  00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.919 And here you can see the difference between the two  00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.320 And here is the clipping parameter  00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320 You can create something like a canyon  00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.320 Or you can create a bottom, for example, define the water level and sea level  00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.320 So, that was the noise  00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.320 And I already said that usually the water level is higher than the mountain  00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:27.719 And I already said that usually I start with some preset of the already created grid or layout  00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.719 When we already have some basis, we can use the Height Field Project node  00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:38.719 Here on the left we connect the field of height, on the right the projection  00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.719 And we get such a layout with which we can work further  00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.719 You can also add noise  00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:50.719 You can reduce the amplitude to make it more clear what we get  00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.719 And you can also add noise  00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:05.719 And as soon as you get some more or less suitable shape, then you can manipulate it  00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:11.719 Most often I use two methods for this, terraces and Height Field Layer  00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:14.719 Let's start with the terrace  00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.719 I will add the Height Field Terrace node  00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.120 It was recently updated  00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.120 And I think there is nothing to explain here, everything is clear  00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.120 Here you can change the height and thus change this mask  00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.120 Create a minimum and maximum height  00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.120 You can turn on and off the smoothing of the edges  00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.120 Maximum step size, displacement, smoothing of the edges  00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.120 I think everything is clear and so  00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.120 And in the Terracing section, you can change the frequency  00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.120 So we change the location of these terraces  00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.120 Visually it becomes much more interesting  00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.120 And since we have already started working with this, I need to mention one thing  00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.120 Most often the Height Field is controlled by masks  00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.520 These masks can be created on the basis of anything  00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.520 And often you need to remove this mask  00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.520 There is a special node for this, Mask Clear, and look, it will disappear  00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.520 We will talk about masks a little later, while we consider the Height Field Layer node  00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.520 It is a little more complicated than Height Field Terrace  00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.520 It also has two inputs  00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:47.919 I will connect the same node to both  00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.919 But here you can add several different Height Fields and mix them using a mask  00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:00.919 It's great, you can basically remap, you can change the height, displacement  00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:04.919 If you want, you can add a mask  00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:10.919 For example, add a Mask By Feature node  00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.919 And here you can choose the slope, height, and so on  00:08:25.919 --> 00:08:28.919 Let's try the slope  00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:33.919 We will soften it a little  00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:39.919 And so you can control different parts of the terrain  00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:44.319 And then you can mix all this and create a very interesting result  00:08:46.319 --> 00:08:48.319 Let me turn it off for now  00:08:49.319 --> 00:08:51.319 And we will consider the Erosion node  00:08:52.319 --> 00:08:55.319 Erosion is the main part of this working process  00:09:00.319 --> 00:09:07.319 You just need to go back to the first frame, because this node works on the basis of time dependence  00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:13.319 At this stage, it is good if you have less voxels  00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:18.319 That is, grid spacing is greater, because the process will be faster  00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:21.319 However, at the same time, you will lose some details  00:09:22.319 --> 00:09:25.319 That is, you will get an approximate idea of what you will get in the end  00:09:26.319 --> 00:09:28.319 But you can increase the detail later  00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:34.319 If I now turn on the playback, the erosion will begin, and we will get something more interesting  00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:43.319 And now all this happens in real time, I did not speed up anything  00:09:44.319 --> 00:09:47.319 And look what we have, it seems to me that it is already more interesting  00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:54.319 You can choose the frame that you like the most, stop on it  00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:59.319 If you need more details, you can go back to the beginning  00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:02.319 And now we will add a new layer  00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:05.319 And we will add a new layer  00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.720 If you need more details, you can go back to the beginning  00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.720 And reduce grid spacing to make the resolution higher  00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.720 I think that will be enough  00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.720 If I do erosion again, I will have more details  00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.720 And now we will add a new layer  00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.720 And we will reduce the size of the layer  00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.720 And we will reduce the size of the layer  00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.720 Super  00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.720 We will quickly consider the parameters of the erosion node  00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.720 So thermal erosion is what forms a mountain and accumulates debris on the slopes  00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.720 And hydra erosion is like a landscape cut by rivers  00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.120 And in this version, water accumulates at the base  00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.120 And both of them affect each other to some extent  00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.120 Here the cut angle allows you to accumulate more or less debris  00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.120 If the value is high, then you will have less to accumulate  00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.520 And so your rivers will not be so strong, not so deep  00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.520 That is, they will cut the terrain much less  00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.520 I will return the default value  00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.520 And there is also the Advanced tab  00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.520 There are also additional parameters  00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.520 Again, I will not go to the advanced tab  00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.920 There are also additional parameters  00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.920 Again, I will not talk about all of them, there are many  00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.920 I will list the most important of them, which I personally use most often  00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:09.920 Removal Rate here allows you to create deep river streams, cut more terrain  00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.920 And the removal rate of thermal erosion will control how much debris will be  00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:25.319 If I set 5 and run the erosion, we will see that the rivers will become clearer and deeper than before  00:12:26.319 --> 00:12:29.319 This is because now there is nothing to fill them with  00:12:35.319 --> 00:12:39.319 And there is also a lot of debris and debris that accumulates on the slopes  00:12:40.319 --> 00:12:44.319 And here you need the Removal Rate parameter  00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:49.319 If you increase this value, then we will remove all this debris on the slopes  00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.319 I will return the default values  00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:11.319 If you want the erosion lines to be wider and deeper, then you need to increase the amount of precipitation  00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:18.720 And here is also the density and evaporation rate  00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.720 So you increase the amount of precipitation  00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.720 If you like some areas where you want to save the previous effect,  00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.120 you can use the Height Field Layer and project some details back  00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.120 Let me show you what I mean  00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.120 I will add the Height Field Layer node  00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.120 And then we take the Height Field Paint node  00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.520 I will press Enter  00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.520 And I will paint the area where the new details should be  00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.520 Let's say here  00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.520 And look how it looks before and after  00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.520 So these erosion lines appeared only in this area  00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.920 I often use the low resolution mesh erosion  00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:36.920 I add some details and then I do another erosion for higher frequency details  00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.920 There is another cool node, I will move it to the side  00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.920 And I will return here  00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.920 And I will press Enter  00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:54.319 I will move it to the side  00:14:54.319 --> 00:14:56.319 And I will return here  00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:00.319 And now I will add the Slump node  00:15:05.319 --> 00:15:09.319 But before using this node, we need to mask the slope  00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:12.319 That is, define the slope with which we will work  00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:18.319 And when we say slope slope, I mean a collection of garbage  00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.720 Which accumulates on the slopes, like with erosion  00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.720 And although now we will get a kind of fake result, it will still be quite impressive  00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.720 First we need the Mask By Feature node  00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.720 Now I want to capture the lower part  00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.720 This corner at the base  00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.120 I need something less than 90 degrees  00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.120 And after that, to make sure we see what's going on here  00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.120 I will add another Mask Clear node  00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.520 And after that, to make sure we see what's going on here  00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.520 I will add another Mask Clear node  00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.520 Look, compare before  00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.520 Here  00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.520 And after  00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.520 Here we have a collection of debris  00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.520 If at the moment you are satisfied with what happened  00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.920 Then you can add the Convert Height field node  00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.920 And this field of height will be converted to geometry  00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.920 Here you can change the density before exporting  00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.920 Increase or decrease  00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.920 Only before exporting, let's discuss the creation of the surface  00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.920 Here we had an erosion node, let's delete it  00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.920 And look, here is the visualization tab  00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.920 I will turn it on in the viewport  00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.920 I will show the materials  00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.920 Here we already have additional information for shading  00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.920 Here we have a range that can be changed and thus distribute colors  00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.920 And they will then be baked on the points  00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.320 Plus there are masks that were created after the use of erosion  00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.320 If you don't need them, you can delete the masks  00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.320 Then I will add the Height field and Flow field  00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.320 And so you can create this information yourself  00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.720 Super  00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:57.720 And now we export Height, Flow and Flow Dear  00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.720 And after converting, this information will remain and can be used  00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.720 The next thing we will do is add a new layer  00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.720 And we will add a new layer  00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.720 And we will add a new layer  00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.720 And we will add a new layer  00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.720 And after converting, this information will remain and can be used  00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.720 In the next lesson we will talk about the use of these attributes  00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.720 But for now it is enough to know that they exist  00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:30.720 And as before, if we want to export this geometry or cache it  00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.720 I always advise using the Alembic node  00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.720 Export and load back  00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.720 I copy the parameter and connect these nodes together  00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.720 Super  00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.720 So it was a very short description of the Height fields and how to use them  00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.720 And in the next lesson we will consider other ways to use Height fields  00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.720 And in the next lesson we will consider other ways to use Height fields  00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.720 And different parameters and options of these fields that may be useful to us

the Canada map  00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000 And here you can take some scans  00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000 for British Columbia  00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000 To find this data  00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000 I will share this link with you  00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000 I have it saved in the selected  00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000 I will share with you if you want  00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000 to use the same  00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000 Then you will not have to search this page yourself  00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000 But now I will use the UK map  00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000 I know that in the north-west  00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000 we have mountains  00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000 And you can choose here  00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000 some place  00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 And also you can choose  00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000 the country  00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000 or the country  00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000 I think this area looks good  00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 There are a few mountains  00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000 and a big lake  00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 And now you just need  00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000 double clicks  00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000 And you need to circle this area  00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000 No, first click  00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000 and then double click  00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000 on the area we need  00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000 First I will circle it  00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000 Excellent  00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000 And then click download  00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000 After loading you can take  00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 the file you want  00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000 If I want this one  00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000 it has its own ID  00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000 You need to choose it  00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000 And then when I download it  00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 I will have a TIFF file  00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000 It will look like this  00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000 And now you can go to Houdini  00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000 And now in Houdini  00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000 in the geometry node  00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000 you can add a height field file  00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000 And here I will find my TIFF file  00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000 And I will add a height field file  00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000 And I will add a height field file  00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000 And now we have something  00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000 It's a good result  00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 And now we can control  00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 what we have  00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000 As I said before  00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000 I prefer the range  00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000 500-600  00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000 in both positive and negative directions  00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000 Because this way the result  00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000 will be more predictable  00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000 And now we can reduce the height  00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000 I think the mountains are too big  00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000 And now we have a height field  00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000 And now we can do  00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000 all the usual operations  00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000 as before  00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000 If you want to check  00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000 you can go to the side view  00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000 and see what height you have  00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000 and what should be  00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000 the landscape of real life  00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000 and then change it  00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 And I already said that  00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 in this scale  00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000 the operation with the heights  00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000 will be more or less predictable  00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000 So I will leave it as it is  00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000 If you have a too high  00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000 height field  00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000 higher than 0  00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000 you can change it  00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000 You can do the height field trim up node  00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000 but it will not be so easy  00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000 to move it by Y  00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000 You can just take the height field layer  00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000 and change it  00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000 to 0  00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000 and then change it  00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000 to 0  00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000 and then change it  00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000 to 0  00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000 And of course you can add terraces  00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000 if you want  00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000 And now I will delete the mask  00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000 And again with the mask layer node  00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000 Next is erosion  00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 To add more  00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000 of the same color  00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000 I will remove the mask  00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000 and then  00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000 I will remove the mask  00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000 and then  00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000 I will remove the mask  00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000 and then  00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000 I will remove the mask  00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000 to add more details  00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000 Here we calculate the range  00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000 and we can make the base blue  00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000 And again you can use  00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000 nodes like flow field  00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000 and create more masks  00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000 or mask by feature  00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000 And so create a mask for slopes  00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000 or more rocky places  00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000 And now I will add  00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000 the top layer  00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000 and I will make it  00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000 a bit more  00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000 more  00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000 If you want to visualize it better  00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000 you can use the height field quick shade node  00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000 But now it glitches a little  00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000 But you can quickly test some things with it  00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000 Let me remove the mask  00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000 And so you can see  00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000 what the masks do  00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000 It was water  00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000 There is cliffs  00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000 There is debris  00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000 There is water  00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000 There is water  00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000 There is water  00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000 There is water  00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000 There is water  00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000 There is water  00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000 There is debris  00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000 Flow  00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000 And a little later we can do other operations  00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000 And a little later we can do other operations  00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000 Now I think we can stop  00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000 So this is how you use the height field  00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000 Or more precisely you use satellite data  00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000 to create real  00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000 height fields in Houdini  00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000 And at the end do the same  00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000 Convert this field into geometry  00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000 Convert this field into geometry  00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000 But it turned out to be too dense  00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000 I think 0.4 will be enough  00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000 I think 0.4 will be enough  00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000 Ok, we will finish here  00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000 So we saw different ways  00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000 to create unique  00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000 and convenient  00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000 landscapes in Houdini  00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000 But Houdini has its limitations  00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000 But Houdini has its limitations  00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000 It is difficult to get realistic  00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000 and customized data  00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000 It is difficult to get realistic and customized data  00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000 There is another program  00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000 that specializes in landscapes  00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000 and allows you to get very realistic  00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 and controlled results  00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000 This is Gaia  00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000 Next we will analyze it
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000 As I said, GAIA from QuadSpinner is a special program for creating landscapes.  00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000 It works similarly to the highlands in Houdini.  00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000 Here, again, the working process is based on nodes, and these nodes are combined to create an unlimited number of variations.  00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000 I would refer GAIA to the same category as SP3 and Substance Painter.  00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000 These are programs that perform complex tasks, but at the same time they do these tasks with interest and allow you to achieve great results.  00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000 We will consider GAIA through the prism of the artist Houdini and try to compare them.  00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000 The main advantage of using GAIA is that the final result is very high-quality and easy to obtain.  00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000 But the biggest drawback is that the working process is not related to other parts of the pipeline.  00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000 But these problems are solved along the way.  00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000 To load GAIA, you need to go to the quadspinner.com site.  00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000 And maybe you know QuadSpinner from their plugins World Machine.  00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.000 If you compare different versions, then the free version is basically fully functional, only with some limitations related to the resolution.  00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000 But in general, it is quite suitable for creating mountains in the background.  00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000 And there are also no-sales licenses.  00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000 You can download the free version and maybe later you will come back and try the indie version.  00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000 For this course, the free version is quite suitable.  00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000 When you open GAIA for the first time, you can choose a preset in this window.  00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000 There are great examples of scenes, you can see them.  00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000 I would advise you to look at them all and try to figure out these setups.  00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.000 If I open Mountain Range, for example, I used it in Houdini when creating the course, creating the city.  00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000 As you can see, it turns out to be a rather simple graph, not complicated at all.  00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000 But given that we will look at this terrain from a long distance, it seems to me that it looks great.  00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000 And of course, as we work, we will consider more complex processes.  00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000 Let's start a new scene.  00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000 Let's start with the interface.  00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000 I will not explain each button, of course, but it will take a lot of time.  00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 We will just study them along the way.  00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000 But of course, at first you need to understand how to navigate the program.  00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000 We start with the tool panel on the left.  00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000 All nodes are contained here.  00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000 You can simply drag them into the working area.  00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000 Like this.  00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000 Or you can press the tab and write what you need here.  00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000 You press escape to exit this menu.  00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000 So, on top of this, there is a section of primitives.  00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000 This is a parameter that is used to create a new scene.  00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000 And here we have a parameter that is used to create a new scene.  00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000 And of course, later they are mixed and so more complex terrains are created.  00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000 Note that on this panel some nodes are highlighted with a brighter color.  00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000 These are the most common nodes that are usually used in the process of creating a terrain.  00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000 And here we have a parameter that is used to create a terrain.  00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000 And here we have a parameter that is used to create a terrain.  00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000 And here we have a parameter that is used to create a terrain.  00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000 And here we have a parameter that is used to create a terrain.  00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000 And so, here we have a parameter that is used to create a terrain.  00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000 So, here we have the parameter mountain immediately added.  00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000 I think you already know that one from Cudina?  00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000 It is the same here. All nodes are connected to each other and you work from left to right, not from top to bottom.  00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.200 to this working area, to view the node result, you need to click on it. When you click on it,  00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:38.720 it is displayed here at the top in the viewport. If you want, you can create several different graphs  00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.920 in one scene . To do this, you add a new tab. You can name it as you like.  00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:52.440 And now you have different networks. And later we will talk about how these graphs can interact  00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.960 with each other. There is also a context menu here when you click the right mouse button,  00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.760 but we will consider all these options a little later. When you work with nodes in this editor,  00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.040 you can drag one node to another and they will automatically connect.  00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.240 And if you highlight this connection and click delete, it will be deleted.  00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.280 You can also connect by dragging the connection from one marker to another.  00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.320 As in Houdini, these nodes have inputs and outputs. We will also consider them later.  00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:43.440 At the top, as I said, there is a viewport, this is the viewing area. The navigation in the viewport and in the  00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.000 bottom editor is quite standard. For panning, you use the middle button in the graph here,  00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.200 zoom in with the wheel, and at the top there is an alt and left button for rotation, a wheel for zooming,  00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.400 and the middle button panes. Only here it is done a little different from what you expect from a  00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:08.760 regular 3D package. It's like moving in a horizontal plane. And you can also use the  00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:15.000 WASD button for panning. And the space is centered.  00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.280 There is also an opportunity to view the data in a 2D window, and I advise you to open both of them at once.  00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.080 So you can see well what is actually happening with this geometry.  00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:39.960 And here I will press this icon, show rough data. We will see the map that creates this geometry.  00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.000 Here you can press this button and thus increase the contrast.  00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.520 In general, I think you understand what Gaia is, in fact, it is a program for creating terrains.  00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.919 And it has a bunch of great features.  00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:03.880 If you are a composer and if you worked in Houdini in COPS and WAPS, then here you can apply the same logic.  00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:17.480 Above the viewport we see a red button for saving. It is needed because some operations  00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:23.840 and texture resolution can be quite complex. Here it can be up to 4K size, and the program  00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.159 may not be quite stable when you start to connect large graphs. Therefore, it is advisable to save  00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:36.760 in Gaia more often. On the right there is also an incremental save. When you press this button,  00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:44.039 versions are updated. On the left, I have a cursor here, this is the viewport resolution.  00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:48.320 Standard 0.5K can be increased to 4K.  00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.440 I will show in normal 4K.  00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.440 Of course, it works a little slower, but the quality will be much higher.  00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.120 As with high fields, it is advisable to start with low resolution, and then at the end  00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.799 increase to 4K to get more details. Let's go back for now.  00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:25.440 On the right of all these panels we have a window with properties,  00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.920 similar to the parameters in Houdini. Of course, they change depending on what node you have selected.  00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.360 There are several very cool options in the interface. For example, when you change the  00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.919 value, the previous value is also marked here. Look, there is such a point.  00:08:47.359 --> 00:08:54.079 And there is also a context menu. Here you can choose the default value or change the  00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:59.439 increment, increase or decrease. You can immediately reduce the value by half or double it.  00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:02.680 Well, you can just manually enter it if you want.  00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.839 But in general, it is very convenient to see what values ​​you had before this value. And so you can  00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.760 return to them or switch between them.  00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:23.360 There is also an Adjustments section in the lower part of this window. There are several parameters here.  00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.440 The main part that is used is After Level.  00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.880 It is very convenient when you combine different nodes together. And so you check that they are in the  00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.760 same range. We will analyze this later. Now just remember that this is here.  00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.680 There is Level, Equalize, Clamp, Min and Max.  00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:48.880 This Drop to Floor is also often used.  00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.439 Now we have this terrain at zero, but it does not always happen at zero,  00:09:56.439 --> 00:09:58.960 and this drop to floor flag will just come in handy here.  00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.000 Well, that's it, I think that's enough. You can quite start doing something.  00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.960 Let's try to create some terrain.  00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.240 So, for starters, we already have the Mountain node here.  00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:22.200 If I increase the resolution to 2K, you will already see how good the result is, even with one node.  00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:37.600 Also, if you look at the tool panel, you will notice how thought out it is,  00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.280 how conveniently it is organized.  00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.120 That is, here you basically go through the whole setup from start to finish,  00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.200 and the nodes are located in the same way. We will consider each of these sections,  00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.720 but not all nodes, but one or two of each section.  00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.160 In primitives, we can take the Perlin noise, for example.  00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:07.480 If we look at the rough data, there will be such a standard noise,  00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.040 very similar to the one we use in Houdini.  00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.000 Next, Geo Primitives. And these are the main nodes that are used to create terrain.  00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:29.360 There are many different types here. I have Mountain, or you can take Mountain Range.  00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.600 And right from the very beginning, a very cool result is obtained.  00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.920 It's actually difficult to make a mistake with Gaia here.  00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:45.040 So, as soon as you decide what landscape you need, you start making changes.  00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.599 Displace looks a lot like post-processing in the Height Field Noise node.  00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.760 If I connect them, just drag and connect the output with the input.  00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.760 And I will increase the value a little.  00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:06.439 We get some kind of similar result.  00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.320 After Warps, we have Adjustment nodes. And here we have a lot of terms familiar with  00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.680 Compositing, a lot of familiar nodes.  00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.400 And here we move something very often, so there is a Transform node. I will add it.  00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.880 And here we have a Transformation node.  00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.800 And I can move everything like this. And let's say I have a river here.  00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000 I think you got the idea.  00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.320 So, now we've added a few nodes. Next, we can discuss organization.  00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.920 For example, node connection. When they are close to each other. Very convenient.  00:12:52.599 --> 00:12:56.599 Also, we need to distinguish Pin and Pin as Underlay.  00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:06.040 If we want to save the node in the viewport as it is now, so that the view does not change when we switch between the nodes,  00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.240 then we can fix this by pressing F. Here a small green dot appears.  00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.240 And we can also change the color of the node.  00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.240 The view will still be saved. That is, we will see the result of the last node.  00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.240 To fix it, you press F again on the node.  00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:29.240 And Pin as Underlay will become more important when the node is connected to the node.  00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.240 And we can also change the color of the node.  00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.240 And we can also change the color of the node.  00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.240 And we can also change the color of the node.  00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.240 To fix it, you press F again on the node.  00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.240 And Pin as Underlay will become more important when we move on to the surface processing.  00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.240 There is one very cool thing in GAIA.  00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.240 This is the ability to connect nodes in different parts of the graph or even between different graphs.  00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.240 Portals are used for this.  00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.240 If you grab the output and pull it into an empty space, then you will have the option to create a portal.  00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.240 And you will get this output.  00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.240 And now let's take another node from another group. For example, Teras.  00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.240 Here we can do the same with the input. You click, drag.  00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.240 And we can also change the color of the node.  00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.240 You click, drag.  00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.240 And here you select this node Transform.  00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.240 And now this node is connected to this output.  00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.240 But it may not be quite clear, you can rename the node by pressing F2.  00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.240 I call it Transform Mountain.  00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.240 And here the name will also be updated.  00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.240 Now let's look at the Teras node.  00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.240 As in Houdini, you can change the number of these Teras.  00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.240 Change their intensity, twist and so on.  00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.240 Under this section below we have filters.  00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.240 And the coolest of them is World.  00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.240 I'll turn it off.  00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240 And look what a strong effect it turns out.  00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.240 Of course, you don't need it so much.  00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.240 Well, like this, for example.  00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:53.240 But in general, notice how intense the effect of some nodes can be.  00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.240 Okay, we have the beginning of some terrain here.  00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.240 But then we want to apply erosion.  00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.240 We have a landscape, we like what it looks like.  00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.240 But we want to make it more realistic.  00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.240 Here we will need the following groups.  00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.240 This is erosion, look-dev, snow and water.  00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.240 So I add an erosion node.  00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:28.240 And we immediately get a great result.  00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.240 Looks gorgeous.  00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.240 Don't look at it yet, we'll fix it a little later.  00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.240 But notice how realistic it looks.  00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240 What details.  00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240 Very cool.  00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.240 There are a lot of parameters in the erosion node.  00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.240 But there are three main ones.  00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:01.240 These are iterations, downcutting in a sharp way and sediment removal.  00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.240 You can change the strength, reduce the softness of the bark, for example, and change the duration.  00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.240 This is how you influence the global effect of erosion.  00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.240 But if you increase the hydra erosion, you will need downcutting.  00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.240 If you increase it, then the depth of the channels will also be greater.  00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240 I'll do it like this.  00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.240 And now if you remove sediment, they will get even deeper.  00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.240 I'll cancel it.  00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.240 And I'll tell you what happens when you remove the sediment.  00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.240 I'll cancel it.  00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.240 And I'll tell you about the parameter random sedimentation.  00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.240 It will allow you to fill in these channels even more.  00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.240 So, then the look-depth nodes.  00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.240 We are satisfied with the large shapes that we have.  00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.240 And then we start adding details on top.  00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.240 For example, you can use the Valley node.  00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.240 It also creates very interesting details and allows you to make changes to this terrain.  00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.240 I'll turn on the erosion instead.  00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.240 And you will see what the effect will be.  00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.240 It turns out to be a similar result, but more channels appear.  00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.240 Although you can do it after or before erosion.  00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240 I'll do it after.  00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240 I'll reduce the strength.  00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.240 Strength.  00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.240 And depth.  00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.240 Super.  00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.240 Another node from the look-depth section is surface.  00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.240 And I'll make it like this.  00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240 And I'll make it like this.  00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240 And I'll make it like this.  00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.240 And I'll make it like this.  00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.240 Another node from the look-depth section is surface.  00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.240 It acts as a high-frequency filter for detailing.  00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.240 And the last thing I want to show is snow and water.  00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240 I'll add snowfall.  00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.240 And I'll make it like this.  00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.240 Of course, we will see a lot of snow.  00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.240 You can reduce the duration here.  00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.240 The snow will be less.  00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.240 You can change the level, raise it.  00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240 Or you can reduce the settle saw.  00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.240 Then in the upper part it will accumulate more.  00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.240 And when you have determined the level, you can increase the melt.  00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.240 And then the snow will fill the cracks more.  00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.240 If you want the snow to go down more, down the slopes,  00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.240 you can reduce the melt.  00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240 And the snow will be more.  00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.240 Then you can reduce the melt.  00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.240 And increase the duration.  00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.240 Also in the advanced section I will reduce the adhered snow mass.  00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:38.240 And the snow will start to go down a little.  00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.240 And now let's try the rivers, rivers instead of snow.  00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.240 And of course it works right away.  00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.240 The headwaters parameter increases the number of areas where rivers can start.  00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.240 But the most important effect here is downcutting.  00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.240 And the most important effect here is downcutting.  00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.240 But the most important effect here is downcutting.  00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.240 I will increase the water and increase the downcut.  00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.240 Plus there is also the width and depth of these channels.  00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.240 It expands and deepens the rivers.  00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:31.240 In general, I think it was a good enough overview of how to load Gaio,  00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.240 install it, how to navigate, how to start work and so on.  00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.240 We still need to discuss a lot more, so we will continue in the next lesson.
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.240 So now we know how to create terrains in GAI, then let's improve our terrain  00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.600 we will combine, correct and mask different parts of the landscape  00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.680 Well, then at the end we will paint  00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.040 build and export our landscape  00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080 I started a new scene again  00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.839 and in this example we will start with the canyon primitive  00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.640 the canyons already have a lot of details  00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.040 but also note that they start above zero  00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.040 look  00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.720 so here we turn on drop to floor and lower them again  00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.080 why is this necessary? this is because when we combine with another node  00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.400 let's say with the range node  00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080 we will have a terrain at the bottom  00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.120 that is, we will have a small height, we can do remapping  00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.960 but if we immediately lower it by turning on drop to floor, we will immediately simplify the task  00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.120 now to connect them, we drag the connection like this and connect  00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.759 and immediately it turns out pretty good, but something can be changed  00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.760 very often here the combine node is used  00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.520 it has familiar overlay modes like photoshop or other program for compositing  00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.360 for example, a good option is blend  00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.680 or with the help of a mouse wheel you can change different options  00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.400 screen, subtract and add  00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.840 and when we connected the combine, we can discuss the input and output options at the same time  00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.040 in the combine node we have the opportunity to add a mask  00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.080 if I pull it out like this  00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.040 we can add a mask to the main node  00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400 and when we connect the main node  00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.120 we can also add a mask to the main node  00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.640 and when we connect the main node  00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.920 we can add a mask to the main node  00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.920 and we can also add a mask to the main node  00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:15.559 if I pull it out like this and in the selected one I will take a mask  00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.519 or you could take it in the primitive menu  00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.239 I will immediately open 2d view  00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.200 and now I can edit this mask  00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.799 it will be like in Houdini  00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.799 here we start to draw  00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.920 and in the end we see the area where the canyon is added  00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.440 since the canyon is connected to the second input  00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.040 in this mode we see how the height map is changed  00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.519 if you want to see only the mask, then press F  00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.160 and as in Houdini it will be red  00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.959 that is, we see it well  00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.959 you can also fix the combine by selecting pin as underlay  00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600 and when we work in this node  00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.600 we will immediately see this selected area  00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.640 although I will change the mask a little more  00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.600 above you can change the size of the brush  00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.079 the force of pressing  00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.960 you can erase the place of drawing  00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.519 that is, you can delete something  00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.400 in general, this is how you work with the mask  00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400 I will unhook the node  00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.959 and look, our canyon appears only in certain places  00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.480 super  00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.440 now I will switch to blend mode again  00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.799 and we got such a good deep canyon  00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.120 but maybe you want to move it somewhere  00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.120 for this you need the transform node  00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.320 this time I will press TAB and enter the transform  00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600 I will delete this connection  00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.600 and connect here  00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.320 and so now we have a transform here  00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.480 you can press B and skip this transform  00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680 here we can turn it on and off  00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680 and compare the result before and after  00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.400 however, with the transform we have one problem here  00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.760 when we move something, we have zero here in the end  00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760 so we have to go back to the mask  00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.760 and of course we have to fix it  00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.760 to fix this, you can turn on fill edges  00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.760 and everything will be fine  00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760 if we go to the node combine  00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.760 then this problem will not be  00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.760 we have a small gap  00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760 but this, in principle, should have been expected  00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.760 because here we have this mountain ridge  00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.760 and so again returning to the masks  00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.760 maybe we want to use  00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.760 at the exit of the mask  00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.760 to see the result  00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.760 you can add the FX node  00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.760 we connect it here  00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.760 and I will show only the unprocessed data  00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.760 so we can see  00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.760 how this mask would look  00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.760 it would be possible to connect only it  00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.760 and the canyon we see only where it is displayed  00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.760 on this map  00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.760 and of course it will become even more obvious  00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760 when we use snow and rivers  00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.760 but in the end the mask will be where there is snow or water  00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760 and we can use it when coloring  00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.760 and processing the surface  00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.760 and we can change the relief in any convenient way  00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760 and this is the result  00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760 we have a mask  00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.760 and we can use it when coloring  00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.760 and processing the surface  00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.760 and we can change the relief in any convenient way  00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760 and the last thing to say about the Combine node  00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.760 here you can change the ratio  00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.760 you can make more or less canyons  00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.760 or change the input data in places  00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.760 here it is not particularly noticeable  00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.760 but here it simply changes  00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.760 what you connect  00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.760 to the first input, and what to the second  00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760 with this mask it would be clearer  00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.760 see, it disappears now  00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.760 remember in one of the previous lessons  00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.760 we discussed  00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.760 satellite data  00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.760 that is, real high-altitude maps  00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.760 that can be used in Houdini  00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.760 I think it would be great to try to use them  00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.760 here too  00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760 of course it is quite possible  00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.760 here you need to add a node file  00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.760 and now open the guide  00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.760 and find the file  00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.760 I will take the high-altitude map  00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.760 that we took in Houdini  00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.760 first of all, of course,  00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.760 something is not clear  00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.760 but it's okay  00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.760 it can be fixed  00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.760 instead of RAV here I will change to remap  00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.760 and the scale will immediately decrease  00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.760 you can also turn on drop to floor  00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.760 if the field was a little above zero  00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.760 but I'm fine  00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.760 everything is fine  00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760 and everything immediately turns out as it should be  00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.760 but maybe it doesn't look  00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.760 exactly as you want  00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.760 if you  00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.760 adjust the level  00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.760 some information will return  00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.760 or you can add a node for  00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.760 gamma correction  00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.760 it will change the curve  00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.760 and I will return some details  00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.760 and then you can  00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.760 add a curve node  00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.760 and again  00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.760 balance a little  00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.760 the upper part  00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.760 becomes too big  00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.760 compared to the lower one  00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.760 but in my opinion it looks good, I like it  00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.760 just a little more  00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.760 remove the mountain  00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.760 I will lower it a little  00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.760 here you can correct this curve  00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.760 super  00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.760 looks a little blurred because we have a very low resolution  00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.760 if you change to 1k  00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.760 more details appear  00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.760 2k  00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.760 and so on  00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.760 more information appears from the map  00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.760 looks cool  00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.760 and of course  00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.760 you can use any nodes  00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.760 you can add erosion  00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.760 I don't want to change too much  00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.760 but you can try  00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.760 erosion  00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.760 you can add rivers, lakes  00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.760 let's see what happens  00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.760 I will add lakes  00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.760 lakes  00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.760 lower a little lower  00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.760 super  00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.760 of course I can add and add  00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.760 something else, but I think  00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.760 it's too much, you already understood the idea  00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:36.760 before we move on to  00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.760 surface processing  00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.760 I want to show how to create  00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.760 more high quality terrain for large plans  00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.760 in this example we will start with the node  00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.760 slope noise  00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.760 it is perfect for creating  00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.760 any terrain  00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.760 and you can add a rocky node  00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.760 I will reduce the scale  00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.760 make it more relief  00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.760 and increase the displacement  00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.760 and so I get a lot of information  00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.760 that will be useful to us  00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.760 when we move on to erosion  00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.760 and this time I want to add  00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.760 stratify  00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.760 it will do all the basic work  00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.760 only instead of normal I will choose the slant style  00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.760 great  00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:38.760 and I will increase stratification  00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.760 and so I get a lot of information  00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.760 that will be useful to us  00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.760 when we move on to  00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.760 surface processing  00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.760 and so I get a lot of information  00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.760 that will be useful to us  00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.760 when we move on to stratification  00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.760 now we can add erosion  00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760 great  00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.760 but I want to increase  00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.760 sediment removal  00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.760 I want these channels to be more obvious  00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.760 I want to make  00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.760 a more interesting base  00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.760 so I will add  00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.760 the node badlands  00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.760 and so we will have such interesting  00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.760 rocky details  00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.760 then we combine  00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.760 and use the mask  00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.760 here  00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.760 no, not there  00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.760 here  00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760 so we have  00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.760 such interesting forms  00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.760 in the base  00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.760 I will increase it to 2k  00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.760 and if we make 4k  00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.760 we will have  00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.760 much more details  00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.760 ok, let's move on to  00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.760 surface processing  00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.760 of course, work on the surface  00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.760 is also a special kind of art  00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.760 and it can also be as  00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.760 complex as you need it  00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.760 and there are two approaches to this  00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.760 we can add  00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.760 information to GAIA and export  00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.760 the albedo map  00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.760 or we can just export  00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.760 masks from here, which then  00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.760 use in another 3d program  00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.760 it all depends on  00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.760 what the landscape will be like  00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.760 if it's a front or a middle plan  00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.760 I would use masks  00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.760 and then I would work with them in Houdini  00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.760 but if it's just the background  00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.760 then the options for  00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.760 surface processing that is in GAIA  00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.760 are also quite suitable  00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.760 and now we move on to  00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:40.760 the second part of the tool set  00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.760 starting with the data section  00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.760 data is the data  00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.760 that can be used to  00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.760 generate all the masks  00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.760 for both export and use  00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.760 here, for example, slope  00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.760 great example  00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.760 just before adding  00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.760 these nodes, I will reduce the resolution  00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.760 to 1k so that it is faster  00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.760 and look, if I  00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.760 show the rough data here  00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.760 you see  00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.760 what is happening here and how  00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.760 it can be changed  00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.760 we only need steep slopes  00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.760 something like that  00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.760 in many landscapes  00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.760 there are rocks  00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.760 so you can export such a mask in Houdini  00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.760 and thus  00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.760 use displacement and create  00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.760 rocks or you can invert  00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.760 in general, creating  00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.760 landscape textures  00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.760 and for organic breeds  00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.760 is not so easy  00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.760 there is a lot of information  00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.760 that is very difficult to use  00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.760 and reproduce intuitively  00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.760 especially when you need to create  00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.760 something realistic  00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.760 and in my opinion the best resource  00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.760 for this, including for references  00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.760 when you create maps  00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.760 albedo for landscapes  00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.760 is Megascans  00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.760 if you have Megascans  00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.760 Bridge  00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.760 you can open it and here  00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.760 turn on the whole screen  00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.760 and switch to albedo  00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.760 and here you can see how  00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.760 PBR scan of the landscape looks  00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.760 these are the details  00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.760 need to be added in your  00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.760 landscape  00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.760 in the past I used this  00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760 to create a rock, for example  00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.760 look how the rock scan looks  00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.760 these are the details  00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.760 need to be added  00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.760 some of them will be difficult to add  00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760 in Gaia, but you can add  00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.760 them in Substance or in Houdini  00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.760 for example  00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:00.760 but you can at least create  00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.760 masks in Gaia to simplify  00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.760 this process  00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.760 so let's go back to Gaia  00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.760 and I will show you maps  00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.760 that I use most often  00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.760 this is slope  00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.760 flow  00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.760 curvature  00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.760 height  00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:30.760 angle  00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.760 and soil  00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.760 let's quickly  00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.760 look at them  00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.760 this is curvature  00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.760 if you have seen  00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.760 the curvature map before  00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.760 then you should know it  00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.760 of course you can change  00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.760 the minimum and maximum values  00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.760 and the fall between them  00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.760 it works with bulges and curved edges  00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.760 then flow  00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.760 I showed it before  00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.760 here I usually  00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.760 turn on primary and secondary  00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.760 and turn off the rest  00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.760 so you get larger flows  00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.760 and here you can  00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.760 increase the quality by reducing the ratio  00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.760 then height  00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.760 it's very convenient to create  00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.760 gradients  00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:36.760 so you get  00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.760 such a transition from top to bottom  00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.760 you can invert it either here  00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.760 or in another program  00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.760 where you will work further  00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.760 there is also angle  00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.760 and the same thing  00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.760 you can also invert it here  00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.760 or in another program  00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.760 where you will work further  00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.760 here you can also invert it here  00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.760 there is also angle  00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.760 it's very useful  00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.760 for creating atmospheric effects  00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.760 very often when you create  00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.760 a rocky surface  00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.760 moisture accumulates  00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.760 or something like that  00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.760 so this node is very useful  00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.760 again you can invert it  00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:26.760 if you need another side  00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.760 and finally soil  00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.760 it shows where you have soil  00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.760 it looks like a flow map  00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.760 except that we have  00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.760 lags in some difficult places  00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.760 so you can use it in GAIA  00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.760 or export it for use  00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.760 in another program  00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.760 so we move on to work on the surface  00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.760 we will use setmaps nodes  00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.760 these are gorgeous nodes  00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.760 for this reason  00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.760 I used quadspinner for the first time  00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.760 I used their color nodes  00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.760 in world machine  00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.760 these gradients are created  00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.760 based on satellite data  00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.760 so you can be sure that you will get  00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.760 accurate information about the color of the surface  00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.760 very realistic  00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:24.760 if I connect  00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.760 and we choose something more suitable  00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.760 and turn off the rough data filter  00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.760 let's say this one  00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.760 we will get a very interesting color  00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.760 this is only thanks to setmaps nodes  00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.760 and then we will distribute these colors  00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.760 in layers using masks  00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.760 but so far it turns out very cool  00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.760 you can choose something else  00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.760 I have a rock color  00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.760 it's quite suitable for me  00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.760 and here you can change the color ratio  00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.760 you can move these points  00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.760 you can change the bias shift  00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.760 from left to right  00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.760 you can even add a little noise  00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.760 so you add additional information  00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.760 and for mixing we again take the combine node  00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.760 and we will add a little noise  00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.760 and now let's say  00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.760 we want to use flow  00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.760 and create a mask  00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.760 for creating a mask  00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.760 I will take the color node  00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.760 although you can also take the clutter  00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.760 although quick color also works well  00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:38.760 and see what happens  00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.760 let's say we want here a light orange color  00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.760 and we will add a little noise  00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.760 and now let's see what happens  00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.760 and now let's see what happens  00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.760 and now let's see what happens  00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.760 and now let's see what happens  00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.760 and then we connect to the second input  00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.760 and take the mask  00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.760 let's make it so that it is clearly visible  00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.760 I will choose something more obvious  00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.760 cool  00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.760 and see what happens  00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.760 it's hard to see because of the shadows  00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.760 in general, this is how you can work  00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.760 on Albedo's map in Gaia  00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.760 and of course the result will be more obvious  00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.760 if you use snowfall  00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.760 for example  00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.760 I will try to add  00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.760 and adjust as we did before  00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.760 super  00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.760 super  00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.760 super  00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.760 and then again add the combine node  00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.760 I'll take another quick color  00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.760 and connect a snow mask here  00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.760 and so  00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.760 and here on the peaks we will have snow  00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.760 and then  00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.760 and here  00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.760 and there  00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.760 and it will be more obvious  00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.760 ok, I think that's enough  00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.760 so we'll stop  00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.760 I think we have already  00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.760 studied enough tools  00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.760 to create something cool  00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.760 and in conclusion  00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.760 of course you need to export all this  00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.760 to use in another program  00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.760 but before we get so far  00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.760 I want to show the last node  00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.200 This is a node from the rendering tab, the Light node.  00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.520 We have in the viewport settings for changing lighting.  00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.680 But in my opinion they are not particularly predictable, with the Light node it will be much more convenient.  00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.879 Let me connect it.  00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.000 And you also need to transfer the geometry here.  00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.600 And color.  00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.040 Super, now we can move the sun.  00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.760 And you can move it so that we have shadows, like this, for example.  00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.000 Well, plus you can turn on the perspective here.  00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.800 This is this button.  00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.680 And there is an atmosphere tab.  00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.280 You can change the aerial perspective.  00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.200 And you can also change the light.  00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.200 And you can also change the light.  00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.200 And you can also change the light.  00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.200 In the Light node you can change the direct lighting, turn it off, turn it on.  00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.200 You can change the surrounding lighting, change the exposure and so on.  00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.200 All this should be familiar to you.  00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.200 Okay, now we go to the Build menu.  00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.200 You probably noticed that here in the upper right corner is the Build menu.  00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.200 And from here we start to export all these nodes.  00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:53.200 And in the next section of the parameters window we have the Output nodes.  00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.200 I will add a Mesher and Output.  00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.200 Mesher, as you know, is used to create a mesh, and the Output node is used to save maps.  00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.200 For the mesh I will take the last node of the height.  00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.200 I'll connect it to this one.  00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.200 And for the map I need the last pass of Albedo.  00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.200 Here you can rename them.  00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.200 Let's call it Terrain.  00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.200 Of course, you can call it whatever you want.  00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.200 And this is Albedo.  00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.200 Now I will open the Mesher properties.  00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.200 Here you can select the type of file.  00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.200 OBJ is suitable.  00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.200 You can increase the number of vertices.  00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.200 Probably I will do it.  00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.200 Here you can select triangles or quad.  00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.200 And you can configure the LODs.  00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.200 The Output node is a little easier.  00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.200 Here you just choose what format you need.  00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.200 For Albedo, I usually choose PNG.  00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.200 I'm quite tired.  00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.200 And in the Build menu you choose either Normal Build and change the resolution.  00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.200 It all depends on how much memory you have.  00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.200 It's quite a lot if you have 16K.  00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:19.200 And of course you will need to calculate all these nodes, and for this you need the appropriate amount of memory.  00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.200 Here you change the color space and the range.  00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:28.200 Next, you need to indicate the path to save the file and start the Build.  00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.200 We export everything we have.  00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.200 And we also need masks.  00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:40.200 The easiest way to export them is to click with the right button on any node you want to export.  00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.200 And choose Mark for Export.  00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.200 And you can see that the mask is already there.  00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.200 And now I will show you how to export the mask.  00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.200 You need to click with the right button on any node you want to export.  00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.200 And select Mark for Export.  00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.200 It should appear here.  00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.200 You can rename it here, change the type of file.  00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.200 And you can view all of them and mark them in this way.  00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.200 Of course, you can export only the high card.  00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.200 You can add another Output node.  00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.200 And connect the last node.  00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.200 Which will work with the high card.  00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.200 So we export only the high card.  00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.200 And then we use it for displacement.  00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.200 And the last, but very important, is the normal cards.  00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.200 I create them quite often.  00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.200 You need to add Normal Map.  00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.200 Connect the high.  00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.200 And again, connect the Output.  00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.200 Or to this one or to the new one.  00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.200 And just in case, you can invert Y here.  00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.200 And that's it, we're done.  00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.200 But I would like to mention a few more things.  00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.200 First of all, I would like to mention that the mask is already there.  00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.200 And I would like to mention a few more things.  00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:13.200 First of all, from the point of view of the organization, it is recommended to divide the graphs where you build the geometry and where you process the surface.  00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.200 It will be more neat and convenient.  00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.200 You create a new graph, call it Surfacing.  00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.200 And here, after you finish with the surface, you can export everything from here.  00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.200 And import using portals.  00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.200 So you create portals here to export these nodes.  00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.200 And here too.  00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.200 And then in this graph Surfacing, you again import everything back with portals.  00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.200 Another thing I wanted to draw your attention to is these little icons at the bottom.  00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.200 Here is a screenshot, I think it's clear what it is.  00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.200 There is also a Sample Height.  00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.200 So you can check the height of the mesh.  00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.200 You type in the cursor and it says that it is 1000 meters.  00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.200 Sometimes it is useful to know.  00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.200 This is if you want to do the same in another 3D program.  00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:07.200 You can stop the build with Spend Build.  00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.200 This is like if you transferred the Houdini to manual mode and then turned it on again.  00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.200 Here you can view the statistics and just check what took the most time.  00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.200 And you can also clear the cache.  00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.200 You can click or clear both the landscape and the cache viewport.  00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.200 And the last thing I would like to say is vegetation.  00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.200 I left it last because I usually draw all the vegetation in Houdini.  00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.200 But if you wanted to add it here, there is a special option.  00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.200 I personally chose only shrubs in the bushes.  00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.200 Here will be such a ground coating.  00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.200 The problem is that we are losing a lot of important information about lighting.  00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.200 So I will not show you the details of the lighting.  00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200 I will show you the details of the lighting.  00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.200 I will show you the details of the lighting.  00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.200 Here you can see the grass.  00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.200 I wanted to do a breakdown with you.  00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.200 No message was put in the chat, so I deleted the rest.  00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.200 Now you can see all the names,  00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.200 ildings we have identified.  00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.200 But it was not very small.  00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.200 Then you can choose the name of supermajor in the past,  00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.200 so I decided to omit that name.  00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.200 I wanted a small picture,  00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.200 Okay, let's finish it. I think that's enough.  00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.200 It was a pretty detailed review of this program.  00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.200 I think it's time for us to return to Houdini.
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 Translated by the club.  00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000 Now we are moving on to the layout stage.  00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:17.000 We need to put together several main blocks, add a camera and define a space in 3D, so that we can better understand what we are creating.  00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000 We return to the Houdini and I start with a new scene.  00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000 And the first thing to pay attention to is the scale.  00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000 The scale is very important for getting the exact lighting that we will create later.  00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000 And it is also very important for any effects that we decide to add.  00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000 Especially when we switch between different programs, so we can be sure that everything is transmitted as expected.  00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000 Houdini works in meters.  00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000 That is, this space is one meter.  00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.000 And the fastest and easiest way to evaluate the scale is to use the person who we have here in the geometry test. This is Tommy.  00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000 Here we have such a character.  00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000 I go inside.  00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000 I'll take everything out.  00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000 I'll take everything out.  00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000 And now we can evaluate his height and navigate through it.  00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000 I think he is a little less than two meters tall.  00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000 And he is quite tall, but for us it is just a good guide.  00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000 And now at the layout stage we are primarily interested in two things.  00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000 First, large shapes that determine the stage and the position of the camera.  00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000 Now I know that my stage scale is measured in meters.  00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000 I have a guide for evaluating the scale.  00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000 And now I can add something.  00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000 First we add the ground, that is, the plane.  00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000 But I don't know yet what size I need, but the main thing is that it is large enough.  00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000 And now I will add the ground.  00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000 All this, of course, will depend on what stage you create.  00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 So far I just have random numbers.  00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000 No, I have no idea.  00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.000 If you have no real idea of ​​what you are doing, if you have no concept on which you can base it all, in fact, you have such a clean host.  00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000 In the first course, we devoted a whole week to composition and artistic decisions.  00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000 But we will discuss some of them here as we work.  00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000 Now let's look at the references that I have prepared for this.  00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000 Of course, now we are creating a city, but I want there to be some kind of main focus point in this scene.  00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 And I want to add some water.  00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000 This will help us to connect this scene with the sky and make it more balanced.  00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000 It will look beautiful.  00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000 In general, I found such references.  00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000 Here we have something like Ottoman architecture.  00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 And plus such a beautiful river.  00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000 I think it's a good reference.  00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.000 As for the central focus point, when you look at Ottoman architecture, you often see the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Istanbul.  00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000 I think it would be great to add something like this to our scene.  00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000 So, let's go back to the main focus point.  00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000 So, we return to the Houdini.  00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000 And first of all, we need a camera.  00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000 I'll add one.  00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000 And I don't care about the camera parameters yet, because they can still change.  00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000 Now I want to direct it approximately where it should be, what it should shoot.  00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000 I'll take the camera and lock it so that it can be moved.  00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000 And if the city is about here in the foreground, then I want to create some large shapes in the background.  00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Therefore, we arrange it like this.  00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000 And we start working on the layout.  00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000 I'll add a couple of grids.  00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000 In between, the river is marked.  00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000 Let's make this one bigger.  00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000 And this landscape will be spread quite far.  00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000 Now I'll add a cube.  00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000 This will be the main building, like a cathedral.  00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000 It turns out such a rough layout, but that's where we start.  00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000 And I know that the tallest building, Google tells me, will be about 55 meters high.  00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000 And I'll add a dome.  00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000 And I'll add a dome.  00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000 And I'll add a dome.  00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000 And I know that the tallest building, Google tells me, will be about 55 meters high.  00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000 Quite big.  00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000 I don't know the length and width yet, but we'll correct it later.  00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000 I think it will be about this height.  00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000 And I'll move it further back.  00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000 And we continue to adjust the camera.  00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000 I want to make the view 3.25.  00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000 It will be a more dramatic effect.  00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000 The light will fall from one side.  00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000 We've already talked about the composition.  00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000 And here we will place this building approximately on one third of the frame on the left and one third on top.  00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000 The composition, of course, will be very flexible and it depends on what you want to do.  00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000 But such orientation on the third is a quick way to make a more beautiful, good composition.  00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000 So I placed it approximately where I want.  00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000 With the right size.  00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000 And I want there to be something like a hill.  00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000 We just add a grid with a fairly high resolution and with a suitable size.  00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000 I'll put it in the middle.  00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000 Again, you don't need to go deep into the details.  00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000 So far, we are doing everything very quickly.  00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000 All this will be finalized later.  00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000 I will set it up so that you can see other forms.  00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000 We transform a little and create a hill.  00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000 And we will make a hill.  00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000 And we will make a hill.  00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000 We transform a little and create a hill.  00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000 Okay.  00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 Just a little bit of a grid correction.  00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000 Fill in the gaps between them.  00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000 We will use the same method.  00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000 It would be possible to divide this window into two.  00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000 And here to block the camera.  00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000 And continue to work in perspective.  00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000 Let's check how big the hill is.  00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000 Pretty big, but I think it's exactly where it needs to be.  00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000 And the river can be made larger.  00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 I'll make it wider.  00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000 Great.  00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000 Well, the last thing we do at this stage is add the mountains in the background.  00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000 To do this, take the File node.  00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000 And I will find the mountain that I exported.  00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000 Most often in different programs, the mountain is used as a reference.  00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000 But in different programs, the scale will differ.  00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000 Therefore, to get the desired size, you will have to manually adjust it.  00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000 Again, now you don't have to do this perfectly.  00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000 Because later we can adjust it all.  00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000 And now we can start to adjust the size.  00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000 For now, it is important to create a feeling that the size is more or less suitable.  00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000 It's great here. We improved the composition.  00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000 We created such a beautiful smooth curve that attracts the eye to this building.  00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000 Of course, this can still change later, but for now, I think it's not bad.  00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:40.600 Of course, all this can still change later, but for now I think it's not bad.  00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:49.920 Well, the last important part of the layout is of course the city itself, but I will not create the whole city now.  00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:58.400 Instead, you can use some kind of filler and we can use the elapse node.  00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:11.840 Here I will add a grid or you can take this one.  00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:22.800 We transfer the object merge here. It was grid 1 in my opinion.  00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:35.040 Well, and add the Lapse Load Subdivision.  00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.800 And look what happens. It turns out such square shapes that can be used to create a  00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:55.120 simple city just as a filler. I just want to increase the minimum size, I don't need such small ones.  00:12:55.240 --> 00:13:00.640 I want them to be about the same shape.  00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.520 If you turn on ClusterLots, then you will have such uneven shapes.  00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.360 It can also be interesting.  00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:32.400 Now we can again navigate around the Tome to assess the size of the building.  00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:38.440 It seems to me not bad, but a little big. I will increase the number of clusters.  00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.200 I think this will be more realistic.  00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.000 I need something like this size.  00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.880 Now I will add the Extrude field and they are already separated, but I want to add an inset  00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.120 so that there is an intermediate between the buildings.  00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.840 Side sides are not needed and we will get such a space between them.  00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:13.640 Next, add height. We have already done this before with the help of the For Itch cycle.  00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.680 We did something like this.  00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.920 I will add For Itch Connected Piece.  00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.920 From the previous videos, we know that each form has its own ID.  00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.680 In this case, there are 464 of them.  00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:44.760 If we create a node with metadata, then these IDs will also be available here.  00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.680 I just need to add another Extrude field.  00:14:56.439 --> 00:14:59.360 We enter the expression into the parameter Distance.  00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.840 I rename the node itself so that it is easier to refer to it. It has a long name.  00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.360 I'll just leave it as IT.  00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.080 You can call it whatever you want.  00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.560 Now we write the expression.  00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.160 We are looking for the Attribute Detail and first of all we specify the node.  00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.480 It is located here at this level and is called IT.  00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.880 The attribute that we are looking for is Iteration.  00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.040 And again 0 at the end.  00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:45.520 Of course, we will get such a crazy result, because we have a value from 0 to 464.  00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.120 I think you remember what to do next.  00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.199 First, I randomize.  00:15:51.199 --> 00:15:54.640 So we just return the range from 0 to 1.  00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:59.360 Now we get random values ​​from 0 to 1.  00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.319 And then we add Fit01.  00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:11.240 And we translate this value into a new range from 5 to 15 meters high.  00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.160 Something like that.  00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.360 Let's compare it with Tom again.  00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.480 Now we have somewhere among these buildings.  00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.640 I'll move it to the side.  00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.079 Well, I think it looks good.  00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.800 Of course, when we create the final buildings ourselves, we will check the height again.  00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.680 But for now, for the layout, I think it's quite enough.  00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.520 But so far we have a lot of buildings, let's delete some.  00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.120 For this, after Connectivity or before, I think it doesn't matter, you can add the Delete node.  00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.320 We delete by range.  00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.720 And we get such a fake city.  00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.240 Now we have everything approximately in the right proportions and approximately in the right place.  00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.240 Although we will certainly change all this, correct it.  00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.240 But for now, let's just add a new layer.  00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.240 And then we add a new layer.  00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.240 And we add a new layer.  00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.240 And we add a new layer.  00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.240 And we add a new layer.  00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:26.240 And we add a new layer.  00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.240 And we add a new layer.  00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.240 Let's change, correct.  00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.440 But further, I would like to talk about camera movement.  00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.480 But further, I would like to talk about camera movement.  00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.960 And about what is behind this, what decisions need to be made.  00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.320 Let's take a look at some examples and discuss how to set up a camera.
﻿1 The purpose of this course is to teach you how to create procedural cities.  But no cool sets in the style of Houdini, realistic landscapes or simulations will help you achieve a good result without a good shot.  Therefore, I wanted to spend a little time discussing the camera.  I wanted to show you a few examples and camera settings in Houdini.  Now we want to create a installation shot, and it is in all films.  Usually it is done with the help of a crane, helicopter or drone.  Of course, I'm not an expert in cameras, in this regard, I have little knowledge.  But I worked on a sufficient number of projects to understand what usually works.  And the shot you choose can improve or spoil your scene.  And this is one of the easiest ways to improve the quality.  Cameras are usually the first thing students miss out on in their work.  Let's take a look at a few examples.  In this first shot from Dune, there is everything we need.  Here the camera moves smoothly at a realistic speed, and there is even a mountain in the foreground.  In fact, this is exactly what we need. Nothing complicated.  We want people to look at our city.  And of course, the complex camera movement can distract the viewer from what he really should be looking at.  Here's another shot from the Lord of the Rings.  This is not from the city, of course, but still, the movement is slow and this time with a slight turn.  Also note that the camera movement is not perfect.  There is a slight fluctuation up and down, as if they are trying to stabilize the camera.  Next, another very similar shot, this time from Andorra.  Only here the turn is already stronger.  And again, we get such a general overview. And in general, a very good shot.  This is from Star Wars.  Also full turn. But this time there is a city.  And here the camera moves away rather than moves.  Again, the city. And we move back again.  Well, you probably already understood the idea, but let me show you a couple more shots just in case.  This is the arrival.  And this shot from the Dark Knight above the city.  Again, pay attention to the slight vibration in the frame.  In general, after viewing the shots, I think it became clear that we do not need to do anything complicated.  And you do not need to rush with the discovery.  And most of these shots are as simple as possible.  And here we see the camera moving away from the city.  Often VFX supervisors tend to simplify to facilitate the work of artists and reduce the budget.  In general, I would like to get a good overview of the whole city, over which we worked so much.  In this case, since we are shooting completely in 3D, we can make a more wavy movement, but at the same time simple.  With a fixed camera in the final composition.  As you can see, in this scene I have already set up the camera, but then we will discuss how to do it and start from scratch.  At this stage, we stopped last time.  Last time we stopped at this moment.  I just directed it along the positive Z, as it was in our previous scene.  And I added a few more hills.  This time I just took the same mountain.  I moved the central position and copied it.  And again, I used the same landscape from Gaia.  I added it here to create framing on the right side.  And I also added something similar to the river.  And then it becomes clear that this cathedral, which we created in the background, may be of the right size,  but for my scene it is not quite impressive.  I wanted something to dominate over the horizon.  Therefore, I will base on the Cathedral of St. Sophia, but I plan to make it much larger.  Let's move on to the camera.  I think you should already be familiar with this.  If you point the camera out, you can block it here.  If I select this option, you can block it and move it.  You see, its transformation changes.  We have a problem with the viewport, but it's okay.  If you go to the view tab, you can change the close and long planes here.  I will change it to 1.  And I will also change the distance.  Okay.  And look, here we have two main parameters that need to be changed.  This is the resolution and the focal length.  The focal length of the camera is very important.  But I will not go into technical details here.  We can reduce it to 24.  And so it can fit more in the frame, but then the parallax will decrease.  And the focal length is also very important.  Or you can set it to 35.  So we squeeze the frame, but as the camera moves, we see how the objects pass by.  But I still want the image to be voluminous, so I will reduce it to 24 mm.  And I want a cinematographic resolution.  This is the same as the image in the video.  I will also reduce the focal length.  And I want a cinematographic resolution.  This is 2.39x1.  That is, 1920x804.  This was, of course, such a slightly cheap trick.  But at the same time we will get the right feeling.  I need exactly the same view as in the movie.  And we check that the frame rate is set to 24 per second.  This is here in the animation settings on the left.  Here you need to change to 24.  You also need to turn on the real time mode.  If it is turned off, the viewing will be very fast.  Let's look from the camera.  If the real time parameter is turned off, then it just misses the frames.  Showing as fast as possible.  If the parameter is turned on, the speed will be 24 frames per second.  I will return to the new camera.  And for a start, I want to make a simple camera movement forward.  I will switch to the first frame.  I will hide this camera.  In general, let's move on to the last frame.  And immediately find the right composition.  I want the city to be no longer visible.  Here we will add even more cities.  That is, buildings.  We already talked about the thirds.  Let's try to place it somewhere at the top.  Like this, for example.  And now you need to add the key frame.  To do this, click the right button.  Keyframes, set keyframe.  Or you can just press ALT and the left mouse button.  Perhaps all these values ​​are not needed here.  There are not so many keys, but we will return to this.  As a result, I have the final position, and now I need to change the initial one.  Here I need to show a lot, and we want to look at the city.  I tilt it down.  The parameters have changed to yellow.  This means that the key is set, but not in this frame.  And again we press ALT and the left button to add the key.  And so we got an approximate movement of the camera in general.  But then we will polish it.  To do this, you can open the animation editor.  If you have never used such editors before,  then Houdini has a very good tool for this.  Let's get started.  We go to Windows, Animation Editor.  And here we see all the keys of this shot.  You can take this strip and move the keyframe like this.  Or you can grab the point and move it up and down.  The keyframe will remain, but the value in the parameter will change.  Or you can also take these bezier handles  and change the curve or arc of movement.  And I don't want any softening at the beginning.  I don't want it to be such a curved curve,  because it will be slower, faster and slower again.  I want it to create an impression as if we are making a glue-up in this frame.  When switching to this shot.  This softening will remove the energy that helps attract the viewer's attention.  So I'll select these first keyframes  and press this button, Straight.  Since we won't have any glue-ups at the end for another shot,  I want us to stop at the final composition,  then here you can soften.  We'll do this later.  If you suddenly have any doubts, then I guarantee that any shot that you have thought of  was most likely already done before.  So you can just search on the Internet for some installation shots.  See what you can find.  I would like to advise the YouTube channel Amazing Shots.  There is a huge collection of clips from good movies.  You can find great shots.  Let's take the movement and add softening.  And look, here in the phantom mode, the previous camera movement is shown.  I will select all these.  And also soften.  I will try to leave the beginning of the shot so sharp.  With a straight line.  I will also add a little more softening.  Here I am orienting myself on this bezier handle.  You can also open the animation editor not in such a floating panel,  but divide this window into two panels.  The upper and lower.  And then at the bottom you can open the animation editor.  Well, now I can scroll and see how these changes have affected the camera.  And in the end, as you can see, it starts to slow down.  Super.  But in the beginning, everything happens exactly as it should.  And in the end, as you can see, it starts to slow down.  Super.  And in the end, everything happens exactly as it should.  And the last thing to do is to adjust the camera speed.  And the last thing to do is to adjust the camera speed.  To do this, we need to change the rotation.  I think this is an X-rotation.  I think this is an X-rotation.  This is the most important thing.  I think you need to look down a little longer.  And then it will slowly turn.  It looks down, at the end it rises and stays like that.  Great.  If you think that the camera is moving too slowly,  you can move it back so that it covers more space.  In this case, it will be faster.  And the last thing to do is to adjust the camera speed.  And in the end, as you can see, it starts to slow down.  Super.  In this case, it will be faster.  Or you can reduce the number of frames in the shot.  So far, it seems normal.  Although maybe I will have to speed up a little at the beginning.  Super.  I think it's not bad for a start.
