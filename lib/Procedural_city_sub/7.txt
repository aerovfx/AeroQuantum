WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.400 We have dealt with the main elements of the city, that is, with the buildings.  00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.660 Next, let's consider other procedural work processes that will be useful for our scene.  00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.560 The goal of this week is not only to give you a finished result that you can use somewhere, but also to give you the opportunity to try  00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.480 different procedural methods and solve different problems.  00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480 We will start creating a brick wall this week.  00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.240 And we will see how to shift the rows of bricks relative to each other.  00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.200 We will also add interactive control elements for the asset.  00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.560 Then we will move on to creating a procedural bridge and see how in one setup you can create both sharp angles and rounded ones.  00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.640 In the third lesson, we will consider the bridge and see how to create several options for solving different problems.  00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.640 After that, we will move on to VDB and discuss how to create snow on our objects with their help.  00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.640 Well, we will complete this week by examining one of the main buildings created for the final scene.
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000 This week is dedicated to procedural work process and how to create different elements for our city with their help.  00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000 I think a good example will be the creation of a procedural brick wall.  00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000 But I do not expect that in your scene you will show some kind of brick wall in a large plan.  00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000 At least it will not be visible so close that we see every brick.  00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000 But still, this example and stages of creating a wall can teach you a lot.  00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000 And this will give me an opportunity to show you how to create interactive control elements in Asset.  00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000 In theory, everything is quite simple. For a brick wall, we need a number of bricks.  00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000 And each next row should be shifted to half the length of the lower brick.  00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000 Everything is simple. Let's deal with this step by step.  00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000 First, add a geometry node.  00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000 And add a geometry node.  00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000 I will call it brick wall.  00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000 Because later I will create a subnet and transform it into Asset.  00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000 Therefore, I call it as it should be.  00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000 So that it does not have to be done later.  00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000 And before we start working, first we need to think about where to start.  00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000 I want to control each row separately.  00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000 This means that I need an ID for each row of bricks.  00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000 And I also need the ability to control the height without changing the size of the bricks.  00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000 Therefore, we will start with one row.  00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000 We take a line and put its base on the ground.  00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000 It should be at the beginning of the coordinate.  00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000 I will add a Resample node.  00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000 This Resample will determine how many points we will have.  00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000 And the number of points will eventually depend on the number of rows.  00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000 Then I will take another line from the Resample.  00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000 And take the Copy to Points node.  00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000 Copy one line to another.  00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000 This line already marks the rows, so it should be directed at the X axis.  00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000 Only I want to turn around and look at the positive Z.  00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000 To understand what my orientation should be.  00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000 This line determines the height of the wall.  00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000 And this determines its width.  00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000 Since this will be a brick wall, and we will copy the bricks to the Copy to Points node,  00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000 I need to make sure that each second row is shifted.  00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000 For this we need an ID attribute.  00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000 Because this way we can distinguish one line from another.  00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000 And it's easiest to create this ID on these points.  00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000 And then the lines will inherit this attribute after copying.  00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000 I will add Wrangle.  00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000 Create a dog ID.  00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000 Type integer.  00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 And it's just equal to the number of points.  00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 And if we check the geometry.  00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000 In the data table we will see the ID attribute with values 0, 1, 2, 3.  00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000 And with its help we can move the rows of bricks further.  00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000 Add another Wrangle.  00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000 No, not this one.  00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000 Add another Wrangle.  00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000 No, not this one.  00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000 Wrangle attribute.  00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000 And now I will write everything first, and then I will explain what is happening here.  00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 If ID.  00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000 Module 2.  00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000 Then we move along the X axis.  00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000 That is, we change the position of the points along the X axis.  00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000 And so far I will enter manually, that is, I will simply write the value 0, 1.  00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000 And you noticed that each second row is shifted.  00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000 That is, this expression works.  00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000 But what is going on here?  00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000 We have already used the division by module several times before.  00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000 Let me explain it to you again before moving on.  00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000 If you don't remember.  00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000 When you use the module operator.  00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000 That is, when you perform the division by module, then you divide one number by another and return the remainder.  00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000 Let me show you an example.  00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000 I will add a new attribute that we can view in the table.  00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000 I will call it test.  00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000 If I say 3 module 2.  00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000 Then it means you need to put 2 in the number 3.  00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 And say how much is left.  00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000 That is, in this case, 2 is repeated once and remains 1.  00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000 If I change it to 4, then 2 is met in the fourth two times.  00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000 And nothing happens.  00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000 If I change it to 4, then 2 is met in the fourth two times.  00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000 And nothing remains, that is, the remainder is 0.  00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000 If I change it to 6, then 2 is placed in 6 three times, there is no remainder.  00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000 If I change it to 5, then we will have 2 times by 2 and there is 1 left.  00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000 And here we get a certain pattern, at least when we divide by 2.  00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000 That is, if we have an even number, then the remainder is equal to 0.  00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000 And if not even, then there is always 1.  00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000 That is, it turns out something like a logical value is true or false.  00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000 1, 0.  00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000 And then we use the same method.  00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000 And then we use the result of this operation with the operator if.  00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000 Let me copy here too.  00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000 And look, when we have an even number, well, 0, of course, cannot be divided by 2, so it also gives 0.  00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000 And when we have an odd ID, we get an even number.  00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000 When we have an odd ID, we get 1, when we have an even ID, we get 0.  00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000 As a result, this is how we distinguish these rows from each other using the module.  00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000 Even and odd.  00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000 Let's remove this.  00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.000 If we divide by 3, then we will take every third row, or every fourth, and so on.  00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000 So we have a way to move every second row.  00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000 But we still need to know how much.  00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000 And for this we need another equation.  00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000 We need to find out what length these lines are.  00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000 Or at least what length of line between each point.  00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000 It's very easy. We need to take the entire length of the line and divide it by the number of points.  00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000 Only minus 1, because we start counting from 0.  00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000 Let's say we have a line 5 meters long. Let me change it to 5.  00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000 And we have points through each meter.  00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000 Then we get 6 points in the end.  00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000 And we get 5 points.  00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000 But we want the distance between the bricks to be the same as between the two points.  00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000 So we subtract 1 from the total number of points to get 5.  00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000 And then 5 divided by 5 is 1.  00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000 I'll add a wrangle.  00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000 And create a new attribute for points.  00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000 f dog row points.  00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000 It is equal to the number of points minus 1.  00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000 Then in this wrangle I create a new variable offset.  00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000 And offset is equal to this length.  00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000 I add a new wrangle.  00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000 And insert here.  00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000 It always inserts in the form of a CHS expression.  00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000 I don't need it.  00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000 Now you can copy and paste here.  00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000 As a result, I will have the desired distance.  00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000 And you need to divide by the number of points here.  00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000 You can save as a detail attribute.  00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000 If I click the middle button, we will see that now it is one detail attribute.  00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000 Row points.  00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000 And we will see it in the table.  00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000 In general, let's make an integer.  00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000 Since we work with the number of points.  00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000 And now in the wrangle we write the following.  00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000 Detail function.  00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000 Detail.  00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000 The first input.  00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000 We are looking for the rowPTS attribute.  00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000 And at the end 0.  00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000 And now in p.x  00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000 we shift not to 0.1, but to offset.  00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000 Well, this is how they shift on a whole brick, and we only need half.  00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000 That is, we divide the offset by 2.  00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000 Great.  00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 Let's increase the wall height.  00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000 Let's say 5 meters.  00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000 And here I will change the length to resample.  00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000 And everything works great.  00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000 And if we change the length, everything will change exactly as we expect.  00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000 Everything shifts.  00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000 And it turns out as it should.  00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000 Great.  00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000 Now let's create the bricks themselves.  00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000 Of course, we start with the box.  00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000 At this stage, we need to decide whether we want to create a box with a wall.  00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000 Or whether we want to control the size of the bricks using the distance between the points on the line.  00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000 Or vice versa, so that the size of the bricks changes this distance.  00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000 But in fact, it's the same thing.  00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000 That is, the result will be the same.  00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000 Just choose what you like more.  00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000 I will stop at the first option.  00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000 We already know how to determine what width the box should be.  00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000 This is the distance between the points that we have already calculated.  00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000 Therefore, I will also insert the same expression in the box.  00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000 Only you need to change this 0 to the path to this wrangle.  00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000 Let me rename it so that it is easier to refer to it.  00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000 For example, row.ptsw, that is, row.ptsw wrangle.  00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000 And I will copy all this.  00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000 And I'll insert it here.  00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000 I'll try again.  00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000 Like this.  00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000 So far it doesn't work because we need a path to the node row.ptsw.  00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000 Well, now we have a width.  00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000 Now I'll take another copy to points.  00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000 So we have the desired width, but there is no height.  00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000 For height we do something like this.  00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000 And we will also make a path to the second row.  00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000 You can copy.  00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000 And now we do the same in the wrangle.  00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000 I will copy this expression.  00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000 Here.  00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000 For height.  00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000 And you need to rename the node.  00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000 And check that you are referring to the correct line.  00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000 Since this is height, this means line 1.  00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000 As a result, we got a brick wall.  00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000 And now if I change this line, the height of the wall and bricks will also be adjusted.  00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000 If we change the width, everything works as it should.  00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000 So now we have a brick wall, at least the base.  00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000 Next, we need to increase the distance between the bricks.  00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000 To do this, I will create a new parameter and save it in this zero.  00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000 I will call this node controls.  00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000 I will move it to the side, so that it is easier for us to find it and then bring it up.  00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000 And in the interface I will add a new float type parameter.  00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000 Change the range.  00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000 And I will call, for example, brick spacing.  00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000 So I can easily read this value from here.  00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000 And now I will add a new float type parameter.  00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000 And I will move it to the side, so that it is easier for us to find it and then bring it up.  00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 And in the interface I will add a new float type parameter.  00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000 And with the help of a separate parameter, it will be easy for me to control the interval of distance between them.  00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000 If I change this value, the bricks will become smaller.  00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000 Super.  00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000 It remains to add polybevel and we can consider that we have finished.  00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000 If we finish on this, then we will get a low polygonal wall.  00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000 But let's improve it a little.  00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000 For a start, it would be nice to add an additional wall.  00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000 I will add a new layer.  00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000 And I will call this layer.  00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000 And I will move it to the side.  00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000 And I will move it to the side.  00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000 For a start, it would be nice to add additional control elements.  00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000 Because now it's all in one asset.  00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 But it would be nice if we could control them at the top level.  00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000 So now we will see how to create control elements.  00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000 So, for a start, we need to create an asset from this.  00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000 This time I will do it inside the subnet.  00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000 I just show you different ways how to do it.  00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 We used to do it in the geometry node.  00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000 Now I will put it in the subnet.  00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000 I will call it brick wall.  00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000 But this will be version 2, because I already have the first version.  00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000 If this name can be changed later, I will press the right button.  00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000 Digital asset, create new digital asset, as we did before.  00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000 Here again I will call it brick wall.  00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000 Here is the version.  00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000 Let me call it differently.  00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000 I will add the word lesson, so that I understand that we created it on the lesson.  00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000 This catalog can be left.  00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000 I will add a custom name.  00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000 And change the label.  00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000 I will leave the ceiling, turn off the author.  00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000 It will be fine, we can create it.  00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000 As a result, I now have an asset called brick wall lesson.  00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000 If I go to the interactive tab and handle bindings,  00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000 there will be a window where you can create handles.  00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000 And then connect them to what is inside the asset.  00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000 This is exactly the same as if you created a parameter in the interface at the top level.  00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000 And then you would refer to the channel that is inside.  00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000 But there is a simpler way.  00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000 I will go to asset.  00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000 And this window with properties should still be open.  00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000 And you can take some manipulator, this one, for example.  00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000 Click with the right button and export it to asset.  00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000 And look, it will appear here.  00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000 And you can do the same with this line.  00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000 Oh, it seems that it redefined the first one.  00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000 Let's try again.  00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000 Yes, like this.  00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000 Now we have two.  00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000 Click apply accept.  00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000 I will go to the top level.  00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000 And we will have these manipulators.  00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000 So we can interactively change the size of this wall.  00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000 And not just with the help of parameters.  00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000 And notice that it's very cool if I move with the help of parameters,  00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000 the manipulators will move along with the wall.  00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000 Very cool.  00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000 You won't lose them anywhere.  00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000 Only now I want to hide these parameters.  00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000 Of course, if I then made the final asset from it,  00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000 then it would be necessary to clean the interface a little.  00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000 But for now I'll just hide it.  00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000 Everything is fine.  00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000 Let's go back inside and try to improve it.  00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000 Let's create something more interesting instead of such simple boxes.  00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000 You can download them on Omegascans or you can create them yourself.  00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000 Or maybe you already have some ready-made ones.  00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000 You can use them.  00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000 Here, for example, I load my bricks.  00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000 If I go inside, then there is just a path to the file.  00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000 They are of course very big.  00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Let's reduce it.  00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000 We know that on Omegascans they are usually 100 times larger.  00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000 And you need to return the coordinate first.  00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000 And now I'll create a new layer.  00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000 I'll go to the main layer.  00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000 And I'll add a new layer.  00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000 I'll add a new layer.  00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000 And I'll add a new layer.  00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000 And I'll add a new layer.  00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000 Let's create more.  00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000 Next, we need to prepare them.  00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000 There are a lot of unnecessary attributes that I don't need.  00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000 I'll add attribute delete.  00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000 Only you need to save normals.  00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000 I would delete all.  00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000 Except normals.  00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.360 and I will save the UV too, because there is this attribute, everything else is not needed except the name,  00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.440 that is, again we delete everything except the name,  00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.120 this is also not needed, the attributes of the detail, but that's it, it became much easier,  00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:28.080 now I will add the blast node,  00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.680 I could of course just select and delete it would be easy, there are only five of them,  00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:40.360 but let's consider a more procedural way if I click the middle button on the node, we will see  00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:47.000 that there is an attribute name, we already talked about it, let's even check the table, I will find the  00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.760 attribute name and here we have 00 and 05, that is, six bricks,  00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.320 and to make it easier, we can use the expression dollar os,  00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:13.800 this expression simply returns the name of the node, that is, in the blast node, if I write  00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.840 dog name  00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:23.560 equal dollar os  00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.000 and I added an asterisk,  00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:44.920 now I change the name to the lower semicolon 00 and delete the unselected ones, only this brick will remain,  00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:52.760 that is, the one that had this 00 number 00, because here this expression returns the name of the  00:26:52.760 --> 00:27:00.560 node, this is the lower semicolon 00 and then it looks for a brick with this number, and the asterisks are  00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.440 just a set of signs, this is very convenient because if we now copy blast,  00:27:06.879 --> 00:27:11.399 we will automatically increase this number, that is, we automatically select the  00:27:11.399 --> 00:27:18.360 right brick with the right number, I can continue to copy and now everyone will be in their own node,  00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:28.800 but I still want to change the name a little, it seems to me it is too long,  00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:35.719 it will be a and in the name field I will change to a new name,  00:27:38.719 --> 00:27:40.280 also brick dollar os  00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:51.720 and so it will be shorter so much more convenient, then again we create a few copies,  00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.200 only of course you will need to change the name to a b c d and so on  00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280 and  00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.960 fine, well, in the end we again all of them merge  00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.760 because then we will use the attribute from pieces  00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.879 in the node and add the output at the end  00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:49.399 super and so we processed the bricks themselves and then we can now replace our original bricks  00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.760 but they do not match in size, you need to make them the same as our bricks  00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.639 we can increase them with the help of some interesting expression so that they match in  00:29:15.639 --> 00:29:28.480 size, but instead you can just take the mage size node, add this node, turn this one here, this one here,  00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.000 turn on scale to fit, turn off the uniform scale,  00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000 and in the end, whatever the size of this brick, they will eventually match,  00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.920 so it turned out too wide, let's reduce it a little,  00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.960 and of course they will all be transferred here and then copied to the point,  00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.560 add the attribute from pieces node,  00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:15.920 add the node from pieces, right points, left geometry,  00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:29.040 it is already looking for the attribute name, let's just randomize and then in the copy to points  00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.320 we also need to find the attribute name  00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:37.360 fine  00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.040 so we, in my opinion, need to be mixed up on the contrary, but fine  00:30:50.919 --> 00:30:52.600 and we got a brick wall  00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:57.679 and as you can see we have all the bricks are different  00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:08.120 but so far we have six different options we could add more if we somehow changed their orientation  00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.480 it seems to me that on the fifth week we did something similar with orientation  00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:27.040 here it is this orientation node here everything is the same as before here we turn around the y-axis  00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.840 by 180 degrees it would be possible to try to turn around z by 180 then there would be more variations,  00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.920 but this will also go  00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.760 let me remind you what we did here  00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.440 here we create an orientation we define the angle axis and then use the expression or the  00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.320 quaternion function and so we will have even more variations  00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.560 and now in this zero we can change the distance between them  00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:14.760 and thus change the size fine, of course, there are not enough solutions between the bricks,  00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.400 let's add a grid  00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.160 we put it on the plane yx  00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.120 it should be the same size as these lines, so you need to copy the length  00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.920 and insert the height here  00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.120 now here is the width  00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.000 and we insert into this parameter  00:32:48.000 --> 00:33:01.520 well, and you also need to place it, it should be on the ground, we have already done this with you before,  00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:03.240 take the height and divide it by two,  00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.960 well, and it should be the same at zero as the wall  00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.600 so here we do the same and by x  00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.840 fine  00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:37.680 and merge them together  00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:48.400 and so we get a brick wall with a solution between the bricks,  00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:53.080 let's change the size of the bricks a little, it seems to me that they are too wide  00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.200 we need to change the sample in the node  00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:09.840 and then we change the number of verticals and then we change the number of horizontal ones  00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.679 fine  00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:22.120 but so far it is too perfect, it is absolutely flat, you can add a mountain node, for example,  00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:29.120 and slightly diversify it, but let's reduce the effect too much  00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:37.839 and increase the size of the elements  00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.839 and I will do the same with the grid, only the resolution should be high enough  00:34:58.279 --> 00:34:59.279 a little less  00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:06.960 and move forward  00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.439 fine  00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:31.920 and at the end let's add color so that we can distinguish the bricks from the solution  00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:46.600 also at the bricks it would be possible to make a random orientation and then they would be a little  00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.440 shifted, but it seems to me that it's cool too, I'll leave it like that  00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:59.040 and so we finished with a brick wall, and then we will consider the process of creating a stone bridge
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.000 In the second lesson, we will consider the process of creating a procedural bridge.  00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.000 This bridge can be either simple or complex,  00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.200 depending on what functionality you want to provide the final user.  00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.500 If you only need a straight line with a small height change,  00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.400 then I think you can easily create it yourself.  00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.400 Using everything we have already considered in this course.  00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.400 But in this lesson, I would like to create something more customized.  00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.400 I want this bridge to have a curved bevel as the main control element,  00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.400 so that we can better control the shape without changing the sliders and parameters.  00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900 This will be a little more convenient for the user.  00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.900 I also need the opportunity to create both sharp and soft angles,  00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.400 and work with them in different ways.  00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.900 This means that we need to take what we have already learned  00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.900 and add something to it.  00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.900 As a result, we should get such a bridge.  00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900 Here we can create both sharp angles and soft transitions.  00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900 Let's start with a curved bevel.  00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.900 Inside the geometry node, I will add a curve node.  00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.900 It will be easier to create a top view.  00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.900 I will create a curve so that it has one sharp turn.  00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.900 We have already said that you can move points like this.  00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900 And in the form of a side view, let's raise them up.  00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900 Like this.  00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.900 One of the features of the curve node is that we can define sharp and smooth turns.  00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400 I use these icons.  00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400 If I click on this one to add the adjacent ones,  00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.900 we will have a adjacent marker here.  00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.400 If I click the middle button on the curve and on the node,  00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.900 we see that we do not have any groups yet.  00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400 But we can include this group.  00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900 Corner points group.  00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.400 These are corner points. I just call it a corner.  00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.400 If we look now, we will have a group of three corners.  00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400 Now we have a corner point group.  00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.900 And it already has two points.  00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.900 These two.  00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.900 But in general, we only need one. This one.  00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900 I will add another adjacent one.  00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.900 Great.  00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.900 And now I have a corner point group.  00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.900 And in it, this is one point.  00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.900 And then in my setup, I can use this group  00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.400 to process this corner differently from the rest.  00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.400 Next, add a resample.  00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.900 And we will start to build the bridge surface.  00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.900 However, we will face one problem.  00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.400 If I start to increase this value, we will lose this sharp corner.  00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.400 If I turn on the resample by polygon edge, we will return it back.  00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.400 But we have a problem here again, because we add additional points.  00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.400 I don't need them.  00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.400 In general, I want this part of this section of the bridge to be calculated by itself.  00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.400 And this part by itself.  00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.400 I want to divide the curve into two parts.  00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.399 Since we have this corner point here, we can easily do it.  00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:21.399 After resample, we need to save this corner point.  00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.900 So we use the same process as before.  00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.900 Copy the sphere on the point.  00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.900 And here we select only the corner group.  00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.900 I will reduce it a little.  00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.900 And now we group with this object.  00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.900 The sound of the corner point.  00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.900 And now we need to add a resample.  00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.400 Here we have points.  00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.400 As a result, we have this point.  00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.400 And then we add a primitive split node.  00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.400 We take this group.  00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.400 And we add a point.  00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.400 And we add a point.  00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.900 And the point goes on.  00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.900 And then the point goes on.  00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.900 And the point goes on.  00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.900 And after resample I will add a convert line.  00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.900 Instead of one large primitive, we will have several separate ones.  00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:23.400 With split node it seems that nothing happened, but if I show the information before and after, you will see that we will have one more point.  00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:35.400 If I add one more resample, I will create an continuous line of nodes and polypaths again.  00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:45.400 Now we have two primitives.  00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.400 One here, the other here.  00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.400 And connect to resample.  00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.400 Now we can control the distance between them.  00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:09.400 I don't want this line to be continuous after resample, because it will affect another node later, for example, sweep.  00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.400 Therefore, I will add another polypath.  00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.400 And this time I will connect the endpoints.  00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.400 As a result, I will have one continuous line again.  00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.400 Super!  00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.400 So, we have a working process that starts with the bezier curve.  00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.400 It breaks into curved segments and segments with sharp angles.  00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:37.400 And then we separately perform resampling of each type of segments.  00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.400 Next, we take all this and place the subnet.  00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:49.400 This is so that later, if I want, I can create an asset or somehow simplify the working process.  00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.400 The main thing is to adjust the position of the subnet.  00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.400 I will make it a little more complicated.  00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.400 I will have to create a subnet.  00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.400 I will set up my不要, but those of a degraded 파 tat.  00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.400 And, of course, with the best panels.  00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.400 Therefore, on this subnet, I will connect each instruction calling the дуо synil.  00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.400 I can set the thread clipping風, κιт Randall.  00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.400 And here it will affect the 2 aspect network.  00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.400 Yes, I have a different type of unse申 6000 about this node.  00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.400 We call it resample.  00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.400 By Bizier Corner.  00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.400 Super!  00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.400 We have a base.  00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.400 Now let's add thickness.  00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.400 I could add a sweep node.  00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.400 I'll add and switch to Ribbon.  00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.400 And at first glance it looks normal.  00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.400 It seems to be what we need.  00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.400 But if we look closer, we will see that it is now all at an angle.  00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400 It is tilted.  00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.400 I could indicate the up vector, direct along the y-axis.  00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.400 But if we look closer, let's say from this side,  00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.400 we will see that not everything coincides with this plane.  00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.400 That is, not everything turns out to be perfectly even.  00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.400 Of course, this is not suitable for us.  00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.400 It will become even more obvious if I take a curve and turn it.  00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.400 That is, it ceases to be perfectly flat.  00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.400 Let's make it flat.  00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.400 To make it flat, we take a sweep node.  00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.400 And instead of creating quads, we create rows of rows.  00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.400 Then we create a cycle.  00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.400 For each primitive.  00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400 And I will apply the same method as before.  00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.400 We take a transform and move the pivot to the center.  00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.400 And reduce the scale.  00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.400 We reset the scale by y.  00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.400 And now, regardless of the curvature of the curve,  00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.400 all the lines will be flat.  00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.400 And now, to create a surface again, you can take a skin node.  00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.400 Super!  00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.400 But again, we need a thickness.  00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.400 I will add a polyextrude.  00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.400 Here, transform will extrude the front and global.  00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.400 This is so that it goes straight down.  00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.400 And what else can you do?  00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.400 We have this lower face here.  00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.400 This is the output front.  00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.400 We can turn on the group.  00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.400 And we can also add a line.  00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.400 And zero all the points in this group.  00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.400 So they will always be on the ground.  00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.400 And now we will create a circle.  00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.400 And we will make a circle.  00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.400 And we will make a circle.  00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.400 And we will make a circle.  00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.400 And we will make a circle.  00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:03.400 And we will make a circle.  00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.400 If I turn it off, we will have a bend here.  00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.400 If I turn it on, the lower part will lie on the ground.  00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.400 Super!  00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.400 Well, I also need the back faces.  00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.400 After that, of course, you need to correct the normals, turn them over.  00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.400 Node and reverse.  00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.400 And then normal.  00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.400 This is to make these sharp turns more smooth and normal.  00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.400 I will make 10.  00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.400 If you need, you can always come back and then correct.  00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.400 So far, everything is going well, but it still doesn't look like a bridge.  00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.400 Let's add arches.  00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.400 But first let's make it wider.  00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.400 For example, 4 meters.  00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.400 Or 3.  00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.400 And we will make a circle.  00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.400 And we will make a circle.  00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.400 And we will make a circle.  00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.400 Or 3.  00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.400 Good, and a little higher.  00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.400 I will make a circle.  00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.400 For arches I already have a curve after resampling, which breaks into sections.  00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:52.400 But I want to add resample again, so that I have points to copy arches.  00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.400 And since here we work with each section separately, I will go inside.  00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.400 And add another output.  00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:11.400 This is to be able to add resample again before we turn it into an continuous curve.  00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.400 We export the results from here.  00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.400 And now we will have two outputs at the top of the subnet.  00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.400 And here you can already add resample.  00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.400 And we take the second output.  00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.400 And so we again resample each section separately.  00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.400 And now I want to make several arches here and one there.  00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.400 But I don't need the first and last points, because the arches will be copied only to the inside.  00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.400 And I will make a second one.  00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:01.400 But I don't need the first and last points, because the arches will be copied only to the inside.  00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.400 So we add for each primitive, and inside resample.  00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.400 This is how we will perform the resampling of each section separately.  00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:22.400 And if we check the input data, you remember we have this separate primitive and this separate primitive.  00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.400 We take them from the second output.  00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.400 And look what happens.  00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.400 Resample node will process them separately.  00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.400 Next, add Wrangle.  00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.400 And here we remove the first point and the last one.  00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400 We did this before.  00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.400 The last point is 5-1.  00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.400 Return the program.  00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:20.980 Cookies,  00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.400 And so we removed the first and last point of this curve.  00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:31.600 Well, since I know that I will copy some objects here, we need to correct the orientation.  00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:42.439 This needs to be done before resample so that the orientation coincides with the main curve.  00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:46.520 I will add orient along curve. Super.  00:16:46.520 --> 00:17:00.720 And you need to do the same with the points on the ground. Ground plane. Because otherwise the most different sides will be directed normally.  00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.000 I add atribfrancal and zero here.  00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.480 Then you can add copy to points.  00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.560 I don't have time to copy yet, so let's create an arch.  00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.600 For the arch we will start with a circle.  00:17:38.679 --> 00:17:41.600 I will make it polygonal.  00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:50.600 I will change the angle to 180 and choose Closed Arc.  00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.600 I will increase the break a little.  00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.600 Now you need to add thickness. I'll take polyextrude.  00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.600 The center position is the same as the center of the circle.  00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.600 I will add a little more thickness.  00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.600 I will add a little more thickness.  00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.600 The center position of the Z-axis should be equal to half of this distance.  00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.600 This means that the center will always be at the beginning of the coordinate.  00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:32.600 If I increase the distance, it will always remain in the center.  00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.600 And you need to turn on Output Back to use it later in the boolean node.  00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.600 I add boolean and I will add a little more thickness.  00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.600 I will turn on Output Back to use it later in the boolean node.  00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.600 I add boolean.  00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.600 I switch to Subtract and connect it here.  00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.600 Nothing happened, probably we have a problem with the orientation of the circle.  00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.600 Let's fix it.  00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.600 Great.  00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.600 The arcs are small and do not correspond to the height of the bridge.  00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.600 Let's fix it.  00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.600 It will be easy.  00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.600 We take these points and project them on the geometry of the bridge.  00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.600 I add a ray node.  00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.600 We connect the skin from this side as a primitive for collision.  00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.600 The points on this side.  00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.600 We project along the vector. I will remove all these channels.  00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.600 And I will just direct up by y.  00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.600 Like this.  00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.600 Now they have moved to the bridge.  00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.600 Then we take Transform and move them back.  00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.600 And in the end they will repeat the bend of the bridge.  00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.600 Let's quickly test.  00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.600 Great.  00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.600 Only they are not high enough.  00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.600 You can take the Group node.  00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.600 And group the lower faces.  00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600 I will call it Bottom.  00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:15.600 Then another Extrude.  00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.600 Here we select the Bottom group.  00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:43.600 We need to change the group so that we have only the lower primitives.  00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.600 And we lower it.  00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.600 It's better this way.  00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.600 Now everything turned out as it should.  00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:01.600 I doubt that my bridge will be so bent.  00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.600 If you pull it too high, then everything will be spoiled.  00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.600 Although I will never have such a height.  00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.600 So you can leave it like this.  00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.600 It turns out that in the most extreme cases it will not work.  00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.600 I will leave it like this.  00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.600 And now we take the top group.  00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.600 Then we can work with both sides separately.  00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.600 We have such an opportunity.  00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.600 I think we can leave it like this.  00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.600 We have a good setup, but I think the bridge turned out to be boring.  00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.600 I would add a little more arcs on these big ones.  00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:52.600 There are common ways to make such arcs.  00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.600 You can add brick protrusions around as a decoration.  00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.600 And then this object can be textured separately.  00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.600 We will try to use the nodes that we already have.  00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.600 We start from the top.  00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.600 We need the same shape.  00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.600 I will transfer it here.  00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.600 And here I only need the perimeter to extrude along the arc.  00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.600 Here we extrude the bottom edge down.  00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.600 The easiest and fastest way to get these two lower edges is to take the group node.  00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.600 And here we take the point at the beginning of the coordinate, which should be at 0.  00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.600 And this is usually point 0.  00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.600 We add it here as a group.  00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.600 Now we only have this lower point.  00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.600 And we add it here.  00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.600 And we add it here.  00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.600 And we add it here.  00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.600 I'll call it BotEdge.  00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.600 Next, we take the Promote group.  00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.600 And we transfer this group to the level of the edges.  00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.600 And the point to the edges is the BotEdge group.  00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.600 And now, if we come back and change the number of arcs,  00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.600 we will still have this group.  00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.600 And now I want to extrude it down.  00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.600 Here I will turn on Transform Extruded Front again.  00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.600 And I will select this edge.  00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.600 I will switch to Global.  00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.600 And just move it down.  00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.600 And here you can add the same Poly Extrude.  00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.600 Here we add the thickness.  00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.600 And instead of taking the displacement from here, we go back to the circle.  00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.600 And here we refer to the Poly Extrude 5.  00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.600 And now I can create a stone arch with the Sweep node.  00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.600 It's not quite in the middle, so instead of doing it here,  00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:34.600 let's remove it.  00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.600 And now I will add the second group.  00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.600 And I will add the third group.  00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.600 And now I will add the fourth group.  00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.600 And now I will add the fifth group.  00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.600 Let's remove this.  00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.600 And we will do it after.  00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.600 With Wrangle.  00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:04.600 Here I will return it back.  00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.600 I will add Wrangle.  00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.600 And we write P.Z.  00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.600 Equal and this parameter.  00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.600 Ah, plus is equal.  00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.600 Great.  00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.600 So, we did it and move it back.  00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.600 Everything worked out, but here it is at the beginning of the coordinate.  00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.600 And here we can add the Sweep node.  00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.600 We need to stretch the shape along it.  00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:56.600 Therefore, we want to highlight the necessary faces.  00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:00.600 We already know how to do it with the Group node.  00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.600 But I would like to show you another node.  00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.600 This is the Lapse Extract Borders node.  00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.600 It does almost the same.  00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:16.600 But it is very convenient to do this with the help of one node.  00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.600 And we need to add Fuse, because we have points that overlap.  00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:24.600 And then Sweep node.  00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.600 On this side I need a shape that I want to stretch along these edges.  00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.600 And I will add the Fuse node.  00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.600 And I will add the Fuse node.  00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.600 And I will add the Fuse node.  00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.600 And I will add the Fuse node.  00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.600 And I will add the Curve node.  00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.600 And I will draw this shape.  00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.600 I will do it with a net tie.  00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.600 If anything, the size can be changed later.  00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.600 I will just create some element for the decoration.  00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.600 Let's make it like this.  00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.600 And what's cool, in the Curve node we can round the edges.  00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.600 And what's cool, in the Curve node we can round the edges.  00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.600 We take these points.  00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.600 And in the Rounded Corners section we change the radius.  00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.600 And we take these points.  00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.600 And in the Rounded Corners section we change the radius.  00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:41.600 And it's very cool here, there are such handles that allow you to do this interactively.  00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:48.600 And then in the end we can have curved bezs that can be changed interactively.  00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.600 Well, that's it, I'm happy.  00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.600 Next, we connect this shape here.  00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.600 But I think we need to transform it to make it look as it should.  00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.600 Although it looks pretty good, but it's probably too much.  00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.600 I'll add a transform.  00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.600 Well, that's what I wanted.  00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600 So we got this kind of decoration.  00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:37.600 You can copy the nodes and copy to points on the point.  00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.600 Connect from this side.  00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.600 And we'll make a shape.  00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.600 I think we need to turn it, but it's okay.  00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.600 And we'll make a shape here.  00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.600 And we'll make a shape here.  00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.600 And we'll make a shape here.  00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.600 And we'll make a shape here.  00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.600 And we'll make a shape here.  00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:20.600 Yes, it looks like both of us turned wrong.  00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.600 It looks like we lost our orientation.  00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.600 Like this.  00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600 Let's check.  00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.600 Probably Wrangler will ruin everything.  00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:01.600 Yes, let's take X here, not Z.  00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.600 Yes, super.  00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.600 So it's right.  00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:17.600 And since we use sweep, to place these arches in their places, we need to use this transform.  00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.600 We need to find the right axis.  00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.600 Yes, like this.  00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.600 We put it inside.  00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:30.600 And if they are too big, we change the uniform scale.  00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.600 Great.  00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.600 But we have only half.  00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.600 Let's add a mirror from this side.  00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.600 And this curve should be long enough.  00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.600 We need a positive Y.  00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.600 Here, probably, we need to lower it.  00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.600 And scale the points.  00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.600 Like this, to that side.  00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.600 Yes, good.  00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.600 Super.  00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.600 And now they are all the same.  00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.600 The second problem is that they are too low.  00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.600 Instead of copying this geometry, we need to make a new one.  00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:52.600 Instead of copying this geometry on the point, I will copy the lines.  00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.600 And then create the geometry.  00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.600 The result will be the same, but in this case you can use another Laps node.  00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.600 It's Laps Boolean Curve.  00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:22.600 Here you can take another shape, for example, a simple box, and cut the lower part of these curves in the Boolean node before creating the geometry.  00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:29.600 So, it needs to be enlarged.  00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.600 And place the center on the ground.  00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.600 Just like we did before.  00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:42.600 And now I will connect to the Boolean node, connect the curves, and cut off the lower half.  00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.600 Just need to switch to the Intersect node.  00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.600 That is, we cut off the lower half of the curves.  00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:57.600 This needs to be done after copying and before sweep.  00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.600 And now we need to make a new one.  00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.600 This needs to be done after copying and before sweep.  00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.600 Here we have something strange.  00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.600 It's easy to fix.  00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.600 You need to correct the orientation of the curve.  00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.600 I will add Orient and Long Curve.  00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.600 And I think you need to do this before Boolean.  00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.600 Here.  00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.600 And in the end we have arches.  00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.600 Let's try to change something.  00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.600 I will change the original curve of the beanie. Let's check that everything works.  00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.600 Great.  00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.600 Sasha, let's add some more details.  00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.600 For example, the columns in the upper part of the bridge.  00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.600 Let's start with the original curve.  00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.600 This one.  00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.600 I will copy sweep and cycle for each. I need them.  00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.600 Let's take everything before the skin node.  00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.600 Next, I have this skin node.  00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:26.600 And here instead of quads I will choose columns.  00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.600 This way I will get lines that I can then send to resample.  00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.600 And I will add more columns.  00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.600 I will add one more resample.  00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.600 After the skin.  00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600 And here.  00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:59.600 Here we don't need angles because we will copy many objects.  00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.600 And then we do the same as before.  00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.600 I will move to the side view.  00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.600 And create a curve beanie.  00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.600 Let's draw something.  00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.600 This time I will do it without binding.  00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.600 Instead, I will hold down shift.  00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.600 And I will copy the original curve.  00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.600 And I will copy the original curve.  00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.600 Instead, I will hold down shift.  00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.600 So that the points are aligned as I need them.  00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.600 So, while it comes together.  00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.600 Then I will slightly adjust the silhouette.  00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.600 Already with the next node.  00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.600 It will be the Revolve node.  00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.600 Only I want to change the shape.  00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.600 Only I want to change the shape.  00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.600 Only I want to change the shape.  00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.600 Only I want to change the shape.  00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.600 And so we get something like columns.  00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.600 And so we get something like columns 360.  00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.600 And so we get something like columns 360.  00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.600 And so we get something like columns on Powerpoint 360.  00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.600 And so we get something like columns 360.  00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.600 And so we get something like columns on Powerpoint 360.  00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.600 And so we get something like columns 360.  00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:41.799 And we got these columns.  00:38:41.799 --> 00:38:45.799 Only you need to direct them up Y.  00:38:45.799 --> 00:38:48.799 Only probably there are too many of them.  00:38:48.799 --> 00:38:52.000 And I think they are too big.  00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:04.600 Like this.  00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:14.600 Then I will add a transform and slightly reduce the scale.  00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:20.600 And then I will combine with the bridge.  00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:26.600 Super.  00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:31.600 We have columns, but we need to fix them a little.  00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.600 Let's add some more finishing on this edge.  00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:12.600 Then we need to take the same skin and do the same as before.  00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.600 Only copy this.  00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:26.600 Only you don't need to mirror.  00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:38.600 And here again we take the sweep node.  00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:41.600 Super.  00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:53.600 Only I will correct the orientation.  00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:55.600 And translate.  00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.600 Super.  00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.600 However, one half is not directed in that direction, but it is easy to fix.  00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.600 We need to divide these two lines.  00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:17.600 I connect the skin here and then add orient along curve to fix it.  00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.600 And then you need to add a reverse node.  00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.600 For one of them, let's take this one.  00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.600 Since we know that the input data will never change, then it's fine.  00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.600 You can add a reverse node.  00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.600 And now everything is correct here.  00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:45.600 Let's combine everything.  00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:51.600 Good, but they are clearly not where they should be.  00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.600 In this transform, you need to move them below.  00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:56.600 Like this.  00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:11.600 They are still too big, let's reduce them.  00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600 Super.  00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:19.600 And let's check how it will look like with the bridge.  00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.600 I think it's cool.  00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.600 And of course we don't have enough perils.  00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.600 Let's do something similar.  00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:33.600 Let's take this whole setup.  00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.600 And in the same way create a peril.  00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:59.600 And now we need to add a second line.  00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:11.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:17.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:11.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:14.600 And then we need to add a second line.  00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.600 Now this is a curved part.  00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.600 Now this is a curved part.  00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.600 You need to make some adjustments.  00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.600 You need to make some adjustments.  00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.600 Only slightly.  00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.600 And now we need to turn it over, but we can do it later.  00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.600 And now we need to turn it over, but we can do it later.  00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.600 It should be turned over, but you can do it later.  00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:01.600 I think the top of the column is too wide. Let's reduce it a little.  00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:26.600 Super! And we got a bridge. Now let's try to change the original curve.  00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.600 I will pull it up and down, let's see if everything changes correctly.  00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.600 It seems to be normal, the number of polygons is also normal.  00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:53.600 There are a couple of things I would like to fix before we finish.  00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.600 First of all, these are not polygons.  00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:05.600 Therefore, here is such a ugly smoothing of the normals.  00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:09.600 Therefore, on the arch after copying, here,  00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.600 we need to export them as polygons.  00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.600 Well, that's better.  00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.600 We also need to check that we have a division in the section, that is, these different corners.  00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:35.600 I will return to the curve, take this point and switch to the sharp one.  00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.600 Yes, super!  00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.600 So we can change the angle type so great.  00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.600 And something else.  00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.600 We need to check that these elements of the rail and the details of the decoration are also polygonal.  00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.600 And these columns should also be polygons.  00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:11.600 Now these are bezier surfaces, so let's convert them.  00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.600 Perhaps the appearance will change because of this and we will have to correct them.  00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.600 Everything is fine.  00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.600 Everything is fine, I think it will work.  00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.600 Well, now let's check the output data.  00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.600 We have a very nice result.  00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.600 We have a very nice result.  00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.600 We have a very nice result.  00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.600 We have a very nice result.  00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.600 We have a very nice result.  00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.600 Well, now let's check the output data.  00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.600 Let's check that everything is fine.  00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.600 Yes, good.  00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:00.600 You will also notice that now it works a little faster, because now there are polygons everywhere.  00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.600 And the last thing I want to do is add a decoration around these corners.  00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.600 This is so that it is easier for us to process the surface later.  00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.600 For starters, we need to make some free space.  00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:32.600 Here we will take the corner points and find the edges that are closest to these points.  00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.600 We have already done something similar with the columns.  00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.600 We have already done something similar with the columns.  00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.600 Where we took the lower point and then found the edge.  00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.600 Here we will do something similar.  00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.600 First, we need the original curve.  00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.600 This one.  00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.600 I will add a new sweep node.  00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.600 Here I will switch to columns.  00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:10.600 And I will make the same width as in the other node, this one.  00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.600 Also a rib.  00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:20.600 And the width should be the same.  00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:27.600 Now I need the edges that are closest to these points.  00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:31.600 Now I need the edges that are closest to these points.  00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.600 It will be easy, we take the group promote again.  00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.600 Here we take these corner points.  00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.600 And the type of group from the points is wedgie.  00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:55.600 As a result, we will have these edges closest to the corner points.  00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.600 Next, I will add dissolve.  00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.600 And I will call it corner edge.  00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.600 And I will call it corner edge.  00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.600 So, the edges are there, now we need to add a sweep node.  00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.600 I forgot to fix the up vector.  00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.600 Select the y-axis.  00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.600 And we turn on use target and up vector.  00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.600 Then the vectors will change on both surfaces.  00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.600 Next, we take sweep again.  00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.600 Then again polyextrude and ground binding.  00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:17.600 To make the geometry a little bigger after the skin, we take another polyextrude and change the inset.  00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.600 Just move it out a little and turn off the output side.  00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:28.600 And let's combine again.  00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.600 Let's see what happens. Super!  00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.600 Not bad, but this part is too big. Let's add a carve node.  00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.600 I will add it before extruding.  00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.600 With its help, we can change the shape of the lines.  00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.600 And see what happens if I turn on first and second.  00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.600 And I will change the value.  00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:03.600 So they change from one or the other end.  00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.600 And notice what the ratio is.  00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:13.600 First u starts from zero and increases, second u starts from one and decreases.  00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:15.600 I need to bind them.  00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.600 It's easiest to add another channel.  00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.600 By the way, let me explain if you still don't understand.  00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:32.600 What is the difference between this method when you edit the parameter interface through this menu or when you change the properties of type properties?  00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.600 When you edit the parameter interface, you just need to add a new parameter.  00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:53.600 When you edit the parameter interface, you just add another channel, but do not change the description of the node.  00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:57.600 Let's say I add a channel now, call it offset.  00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.600 I will press apply accept.  00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:07.600 And we will have a new channel that we can use now.  00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.600 But if I add another carve.  00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:14.600 This channel will not be here because we did not change the node itself.  00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.600 We only changed its interface here at the top level.  00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.600 Type properties change the description of the node.  00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:27.600 This is the difference between these two methods, but I do not want to change the description of the node.  00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.600 And now we take this offset, copy the parameter.  00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.600 Here we start from scratch, but add this offset.  00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.600 In general, it was not necessary to add, you can just insert.  00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.600 And in this parameter we subtract from 1.  00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.600 And now with the help of one parameter, we can immediately control the offset.  00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.600 And how does the carve node work? 0.5 is the middle point.  00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.600 We do not want to do more than 0.5, that is, higher than 0.4.  00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.600 So let's block the range.  00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.600 That is, we can have a maximum of 0.4 and block.  00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:23.600 And now we take this offset, copy it, and add it to the node.  00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.600 And we will have a new node.  00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.600 And now we can reduce them like this with the carve node.  00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.600 Excellent.  00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.600 Let's see.  00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:48.600 So here we have some problems.  00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.600 I think it's okay.  00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:54.600 In general, this detail should not be so high.  00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.600 Let's fix it.  00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.600 Like this.  00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.600 And we could subtract this height.  00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.600 Now we will return to this.  00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.600 Here we need to correct something.  00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.600 Let's continue with this angle.  00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.600 Another problem is that if I have this corner  00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.600 and this beam here, I will change the type.  00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.600 As you can see, nothing has changed.  00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.600 That is, the angle itself has changed, but there is no such thing.  00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.600 That's because when we go to the skin node,  00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.600 it does not know what to do.  00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:50.600 It does not know which sets of points to unite,  00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.600 that is, to connect with a primitive.  00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.600 Instead, we can skip every n primitive.  00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.600 If I change it to 3, it will be spoiled again.  00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:08.600 Because we have a certain connection between the primitives  00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:11.600 that we skip and the number of corner points.  00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.600 If I return here and add a new point  00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.600 anywhere in this line.  00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:21.600 Here, for example.  00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.600 And I will make this point angular.  00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.600 We have everything spoiled again.  00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.600 If I skip every third primitive again,  00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.600 everything will work.  00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:51.600 To do this, we need to connect the number of points  00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.600 in the corner points group with this value.  00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:59.600 For this we can use Wrangle.  00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.600 Let's add here.  00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:10.600 You can do it before the sweep node.  00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:15.600 We can save the number of points  00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:18.600 in this group.  00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.600 This is done using the n points group function.  00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.600 I will call the variable n corner points.  00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.600 It is equal to n points group  00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.600 in brackets of the input number with geometry.  00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.600 And the name of the group.  00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.600 The main thing is to write without errors.  00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.600 And now we have a new attribute.  00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.600 If I export it as an attribute.  00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.600 And now we know how many points in this group.  00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.600 And now in the Carve node we use the attribute of the detail.  00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.600 No, sorry, in the Skin node.  00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.600 And it is the attribute of the detail, not the points.  00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.600 This is because if I look for the attribute of the point,  00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.600 then this expression will look for the incoming stream  00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:36.600 and the number of points.  00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.600 But I don't want to indicate any number of points  00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.600 so I just use the attribute of the detail.  00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.600 Here I switch to the detail  00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.600 and show the detail tab in the data table.  00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.600 We will see this attribute here.  00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.600 And then in the Skin node we write the expression detail.  00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.600 Here you need to pass the surface node,  00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.600 that is, the incoming geometry, then the name of the attribute  00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.600 and the name of the point.  00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.600 The index is 0.  00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:15.600 The input is 0.  00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.600 And the corner point.  00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:26.600 The index is 0.  00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:34.600 So, corner points.  00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.600 So, now we have this information.  00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.600 It will show us how many corner points  00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.600 are on our geometry, so everything should work right.  00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.600 I add the Normal node.  00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.600 Just to fix them.  00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.600 Yes, that's better.  00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.600 And now I return to the original curve  00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:00.600 and change the type of point, or even delete it.  01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.600 And as you can see, everything works the same way.  01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.600 I switch back to the Bezier.  01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.600 And now we do not lose this corner edge.  01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.600 And finally, let's correct this surface.  01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.600 I think that here we need to create a closed shape  01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.600 and lift it a little so that they do not overlap.  01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.600 Let's go back to the Bezier curve.  01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.600 No, this one.  01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.600 And let's close this shape.  01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.600 Hats off...  01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.600 Battle stations are water well.  01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.600 No last half of the curve.  01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.600 We put the adsorption there.  01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:05.080 With a real  01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:24.299 We also need to bring back Charger called  01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:35.020 and at the same time raise the column  01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:50.020 it would be possible to even tie them together, so if you change the size of the column, the  01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.900 unscrew the nooding Sister tube, but I think you get the idea, but so much better  01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.220 super and we got a procedural dampening  01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:07.780 I really even like you can try to make it completely procedural,  01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:14.820 raise the parameters to the top and use the curve without and as an input data how  01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:21.300 we did it with the buildings. Then you decide for yourself what to do with it. In the next lessons  01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.220 we will consider even more procedural methods and move on to the pier.
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000 Translated by the club Translated by everyone  00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000 To create a pier, the same processes will be used, as before, but with them we will have to solve unique tasks that did not occur with other objects.  00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000 There will be two working processes, one for a pier with straight angles, and the other for a pier with smoother turns. I will show you these on the example.  00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000 Here we connect them at a right angle, like this.  00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000 And here the angles are already smaller.  00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000 So, let's start with a new wall.  00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000 And again we start with a bezier curve.  00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:15.000 I will switch to the polygons, go to the top view and create a curve.  00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000 Again with a grid binding.  00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000 We will start with a rectangular version.  00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000 And again with a grid binding.  00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000 Next, I will add a sweep node.  00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000 And here we will have a problem with the turns.  00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000 And here we will have a problem with the turns.  00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000 Here we get diagonal ribs, and we need them to be aligned evenly.  00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000 And then we could put boards here.  00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000 If we go back to the curve, here we have one primitive.  00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000 The whole curve is one primitive.  00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000 But we take the convert line and divide this line into separate primitives.  00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 That is, each rib now has a separate primitive.  00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000 And if we go back to the sweep, we get it like this.  00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000 This is exactly what we need, but the problem is that they are stacked on top of each other.  00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000 And we need the end of the previous part to coincide with the beginning of the next.  00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000 And the beginning of the next was here, on the edge of the previous.  00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000 Therefore, here we need to shift these ribs.  00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000 Only it will be difficult, because the ribs are directed in different directions.  00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000 This is on the Z axis, this is on the X axis.  00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000 So this complicates the task a little.  00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000 We need such a way of shifting, with which their main direction will be taken into account, along which they are aligned.  00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000 That is, here we need to use some kind of mathematical operation.  00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 Before the sweep, I will add Wrangle.  00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000 And we will do this in the 4-rich cycle, because we need to process each line separately.  00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000 I will add 4-rich primitive.  00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000 And we will do the same in the second row.  00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 And we will add the same in the third row.  00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000 And we will do the same in the fourth row.  00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000 And we will do the same in the fourth row.  00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000 And we will do the same in the fifth row.  00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000 Now we nicely process the lines.  00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 Now we process the lines one by one.  00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000 And now in this Wrangle we need to find the position of each point, it will be easy.  00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000 To do this, we simply need to use the expression point.  00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000 Only I want to keep this in the form of a vector.  00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.800 call it p0  00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.880 in the vector, several components can be stored x, y, z, rgb and so on  00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.520 we have a p0 vector equal to point, input 0, the attribute that we are looking for is p  00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.920 and the point at which we take the position  00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000 and now we have a position of the zero point and saved in the variable  00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000 and then the first point  00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.320 as a result, we have two variables with two points positions  00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.800 now to find the direction between these two points, that is, the vector, we need to  00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:25.320 subtract one from the other, create a dir vector, that is, direction of direction and it is equal to p0 minus p1  00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.000 well, and so that it can be checked, let's export as an attribute  00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:44.360 we write dir and this is now an attribute, we see it in the table  00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:52.400 great, now we have a direction between these two points, but so far it is minus 10  00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.080 so that it is easier for us to use this value and then we could use it for  00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:06.560 normal, this vector needs to be normalized, so we add the normalize function  00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.400 it will return the normalized vector, as a result, instead of minus 10 we will have minus 1  00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.320 if it were positive 10, then we would get a positive unit  00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.799 so it will be easier for us to work with this value  00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:27.320 I will make a variable again  00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:31.480 I will return the scene  00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:42.719 then we write the dog p equal or rather plus equal dir  00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:46.200 I just need to reset the viewport  00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.360 that is, in the end, so we can move the points along their main vector  00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.800 in this case, this is the x-axis if I switch to some other edge  00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.600 here will be a movement along the z-axis  00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.440 so we did this, let's add a channel so that it can be controlled  00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:23.440 add a channel, multiply this direction by the channel  00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.200 call it distance or dist  00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:42.080 I will make a float type  00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.400 the range will be from 0 to 5  00:07:52.400 --> 00:08:01.599 and now we can move them like this, this means that now we can make a shift  00:08:01.599 --> 00:08:08.599 now again return to the sweep node, no, to this first one and return to this wrangle  00:08:08.599 --> 00:08:11.440 now we can move them like this  00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:22.160 we have the beginning of the line here and I want them to move in the opposite direction  00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:36.760 so that this was the initial  00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:44.760 I will copy this parameter from the sweep node and insert it here  00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.760 and you need two less  00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.800 now everything has moved back, I will multiply by minus 1 to move in the other direction  00:08:58.439 --> 00:08:59.000 fine  00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:10.760 so now to add boards before sweep we add resample and turn on by polygon edge  00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:22.280 fine and add bevel to create gaps between them  00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.440 here we select none  00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.120 and we do this after sweep  00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:49.320 and then polyextrude to add thickness, we have already done this for the first and second weeks  00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.640 and then another polybevel just to add fascia  00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.320 make it more interesting  00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.320 at the end I will add the normal node  00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.880 super the start of the setup is already there now I will return the curve of the bevel and I will change it  00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.520 I will switch to the movement mode as you can see everything works perfectly  00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:43.160 but they are so flickering because we have a problem with orientation we need to  00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:50.640 configure the up vector in the sweep node we return to the construction tab and set the y-axis  00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.880 and so everything will be fine  00:10:53.880 --> 00:11:03.280 and you probably noticed that we have the initial point further away from these boards,  00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.160 but it is easy to fix  00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.600 we need to take this first curve, the first part,  00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:23.960 take the first point of the first line and do not apply all this to it,  00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.720 the input curve does not change, so we can easily get this first segment,  00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.760 it is always with number 0, we can group before the cycle,  00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.960 so now we always have this first curve will be separate I call start prime  00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:52.360 and now in the wrangle we need to add a couple of lines with the operator if  00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:00.680 instead of doing it here I will do it differently  00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:10.280 write if and use the new function in prime group there is still the same in point group and it  00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.440 will work as a logical value it will return 1 or 0 depending on whether it is true or not  00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:25.040 and in the in-prime group we enter 0 this is the input of the name of the group start prime and then the  00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:32.400 primitive number that we want to check is the one that is now being processed in the cycle  00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:41.240 this is prime to us the current primitive and if this value is equal to 0 then you need to perform this expression  00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.440 and now all this will only affect the remaining lines,  00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.000 only you need to write correctly,  00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:07.440 in general, all this will affect all the ribs except the first one, notice all of them shifted, but this  00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:14.880 first one remained the first rib remained in place and then we need the second block and  00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.000 here we say if this primitive enters this group,  00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.840 that is, if the points are in this group that we created, then they need to be moved only  00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:41.080 if this value is equal to one and if the number of points is equal to one, that is, we move only the second point,  00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:50.040 let me explain again, we know that we already have a group with a primitive of 0 and we know that in this  00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.600 group every time when we perform a cycle at the first point there will be a number 0 at the second number 1  00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:03.480 it will be so for all primitives in each iteration of the cycle, you see they are all with values ​​with numbers  00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:12.000 0 and 1 and now in this rank we say that in this first group of primitives we take only  00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.960 this second point with number 1 and move only it,  00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.640 that's all the same thing could be done at the end so that they also match perfectly here,  00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.120 but I think it's okay if it goes a little further than this point, it would be possible to do the  00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.439 opposite and influence only on the last point,  00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.640 but so far not bad,  00:14:44.640 --> 00:15:04.240 I want to add a tree at the bottom, too, I will take the original curve from here  00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.000 and add another sweep  00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.120 here I will choose the type of columns  00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.280 and make the same width as in this sweep, so you can copy the parameter  00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:35.160 this will be the main node and here we insert a relative link  00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:59.560 and we should have chosen the ribbon ribbon, not the pipe,  00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.840 but now it's right and another sweep to add thickness  00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.800 here we select the square tube  00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.560 and let's combine and see what happens  00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.680 super  00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:35.360 you can add the same transform just a little shift I will copy here I will insert a link  00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:43.200 and a little I will take out so that this part is lower  00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.040 and it seems to be good  00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.560 and I will move a little to calculate a small value in this sweep  00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:07.440 so well then let's add columns or posts again I will take a pipe  00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:21.920 and put it on the ground and make a polygonal one,  00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.720 only you don't have to do a lot  00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.640 and increase the number of rows because later I want to add noise change the radius  00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.720 say 0 15  00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.440 and in height it should be a little higher than these boards  00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.040 and copy at the point  00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:20.760 and you still need to slightly adjust the orientation  00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.480 I will add oriental on curve  00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:58.960 we need to move these supports a little further let's take this sweep copy and here we will shift them  00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:16.200 well, let's make them a little thicker  00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.800 and add a little noise after copying  00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.520 I will turn off the noise along vector so that it is rather in the world  00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.560 space I will increase the size of the elements and reduce the amplitude  00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:16.680 and so we created a pier and at the same time we join these boards at an angle of 90 degrees  00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:23.680 but what if we want to add a little noise to the board I will take the original curve  00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.160 after resample and here we can add a little noise  00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:41.200 and now in this first noise I will leave the noise along the vector and increase it a little  00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.320 and as you can see they all move somewhere at once  00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:53.720 I can say in this wrangle that normal is also equal to this direction  00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.280 that is, normal will be along the axis parallel to these ribs  00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:14.480 and then in the mountain node, since we have noise along the vector, it will just  00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.360 shift up and down along the line, it will not immediately turn out exactly what we need,  00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:30.080 here we have a couple of problems because we need to turn off the transformation with the  00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:40.800 attributes of the point of the curve, and now we can slightly vary these boards within reasonable limits  00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.760 and if we decide to add another mountain node,  00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:54.960 we can turn off the noise along the vector and here it will again be like noise in the world space,  00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:01.840 so we can again slightly randomize them  00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.240 fine  00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.760 but we all work well when the curve is at an angle of 90 degrees  00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.840 but as soon as we start to turn somewhere, we have this here,  00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.240 well, maybe you need it if you want your pier to be not quite ideal,  00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.840 but let's consider another approach  00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:49.200 let's assume that we start with a curve that turns not 90 degrees but at some other angle  00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.680 and here you can use a simpler approach  00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:59.800 here we do not need a convert line node,  00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.040 but let's take this setup  00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:17.919 and here we again have this problem that they do not connect correctly  00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:32.040 here we will create boards not with the help of this resample, but after the sweep node,  00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.399 I will turn these off for now  00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:48.840 here we take these segments and divide them again I will add a forage primitive cycle  00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.600 and in the cycle I will add a polysplit  00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:14.199 I will highlight one edge 2 and here I switch to the edge loop  00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.000 and if we check different passages, as you can see, everything works well, the problem is only  00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.080 that if I make this first part of the first segment much smaller,  00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.520 we will have more boards in this part and less in others,  00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.280 that is, we need to control the number of edge loops depending on the size of this polygon,  00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.280 we could add a convert line and find out the rest length, but there is a simpler way, this is a measure node,  00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.480 you can measure the area of ​​the primitive with it,  00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.840 if I open the table and we check the primitives, then here we have the area area  00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:21.240 and in this parameter we find this attribute of primitives first the major node  00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:40.520 and then we need a primitive number in the cycle each primitive will have a number of 0 because they are  00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:49.120 sorted by turn and the name of the attribute the index of the attribute 0  00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:59.919 and now if we go to the polysplit, it will work taking into account the area of ​​the primitive  00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:11.600 and now the breaking will be more logical and then we can use the same setup as before  00:26:49.120 --> 00:27:02.199 and then you just need to check all the parameters here these links so that everywhere there are correct nodes  00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.199 and everything is ready in the end we have two methods of creating a pier  00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:09.080 and that's it we will finish on this and in the next video we will discuss vdb and add snow on these  00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:14.800 pierces of course you can add snow anywhere you want but we will do only on the pier
﻿WEBVTT  00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000   00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.200 Okay, now let's see how to add snow from above.  00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.000 For us, this will be an opportunity to discuss the working process ...  00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.500 Okay, let's see how to add something like snow from above.  00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.800 Here we take our pier again.  00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.800 And now we need to get faces or primitives turned up.  00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800 And we don't need this bottom part either.  00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.800 We only need the boards and supports.  00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.800 I'll add a new merge.  00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300 Only with these two elements.  00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.800 To highlight the primitives turned up, we could use the group, but let's take the WAP.  00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.300 And here we create a mask.  00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800 Here we have normals.  00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.800 And I need the vector to float.  00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300 To separate only the y-axis.  00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.800 This is the second exit.  00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.300 And connect to color.  00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300 Now I have normals turned up.  00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300 But let's smooth it out a little before that.  00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.300 I'll add facet.  00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.800 So that we have a clear gap between the surfaces.  00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800 Like this.  00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.800 So, now we have this result.  00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800 I'll add a bind export here.  00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.800 And save as density.  00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800 And then we scatter the points.  00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800 And we can add more points.  00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.300 So, the points are here.  00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.300 Let's add more.  00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.300 And to be more precise, we didn't have a point outside the pier.  00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800 We need to add a fit range here.  00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.300 And let's see what it will give.  00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800 We need to increase the contrast in this mask.  00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.800 Well, if anything, we'll deal with these points later.  00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800 Let it stay for now.  00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.800 But then we add VDB from particles.  00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.300 In this node, we need to find a suitable radius.  00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.300 Point radius scale.  00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.800 And voxel size.  00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800 If I reduce the radius scale point.  00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.800 We see that they will disappear.  00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.800 Now we need to reduce the voxel size.  00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800 If we overdo it.  00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.800 Then this volume will become too heavy.  00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.800 But you need to balance these two parameters.  00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800 And now we need to add a bit of contrast.  00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800 Let's change it a little.  00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.800 Like this, for example.  00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.800 And then we convert it back to polygons.  00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.800 With the Convert VDB node.  00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800 Then merge again.  00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800 Look, we added very quickly.  00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.800 On the pier, such uneven surfaces.  00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800 And you can smooth it a little.  00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.800 And in the end, we got something like a ship.  00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800 And in the end, we got something like snow.  00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.800 After that, I'll add mountain.  00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800 Also, the noise will be in the world space.  00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800 And it turns out very well.  00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800 Not bad.  00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.300 At least at such a medium distance.  00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.800 And given that we will look at it from afar, it will be great.  00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800 And since we used a tripwarp, not a group node.  00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.800 Now in voxel we can create masks.  00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.800 And first I want to divide it more.  00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.800 And so it will go down.  00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800 This is just for masks.  00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800 We go back to voxel.  00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800 I'll add noise.  00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.800 And one more fitrange.  00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800 Then multiply.  00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.800 And let's see what happens.  00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800 I connect to color.  00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800 And here, changing the frequency, I can change the scale.  00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800 And here, I can change the scale.  00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.800 And here, I can change the scale.  00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.800 And in the end, we got such a mask.  00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.800 If anything, you can remove the lower faces.  00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800 So we will make it easier.  00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.800 To do this, you can take the group node.  00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800 And here, normals to minus one.  00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.800 And here, I will call it blast.  00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.800 Then I will add the blast node.  00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.800 And we remove this group.  00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.800 And so we get rid of the lower faces.  00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.800 So, let's check that everything works correctly.  00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.800 Yes, that's better.  00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.800 And if there are any small pieces left in different places,  00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.800 you can take the node lapsed delete small parts.  00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.800 And it will remove the small elements that are applied to each other.  00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800 We don't need them anyway.  00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.800 Of course, you can also add the paint node after subdivide.  00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.800 I will add the paint attribute.  00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.800 And here the attribute is called mask.  00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.800 Let's call it density.  00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800 And I will paint everything entirely.  00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800 And then I will remove it in the central part.  00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.800 And you can also smooth it out.  00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.799 Attribute density again.  00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.799 And connect to the second input.  00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:41.799 Now here we import the attribute point.  00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.800 Here we take the second input, second input, and attribute density.  00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.800 And also multiply.  00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.800 And we take the second input.  00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.800 But again, we need the vector to float node.  00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.800 So that we have a float type value.  00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.800 And one more fit range.  00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.800 But of course, this method will no longer be procedural,  00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.800 because we drew the mask manually.  00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.800 But still a good effect.  00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.800 Sometimes it can be useful.  00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.800 So we excluded some areas.  00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.800 Well, to make it even more interesting, let's add color from this side.  00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.800 In the process of shading, we could transfer the attribute here  00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.800 and do something more interesting.  00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.800 In general, I thought that this is an interesting process.  00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.800 That someday it will come in handy.  00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.800 If we turn off this drawn mask for now,  00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.800 then all this will work procedurally here.  00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.800 If I return to the original curve and move it somehow,  00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.800 it will all be updated.  00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800 Super.  00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.800 So, we have one last video left this week.  00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.800 And in this video I want to show you one of the main buildings from my scene.  00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.800 We will consider this setup.  00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.800 And maybe I will tell you about some other working processes  00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.800 that we have not yet considered.
﻿1 In this last video of the seventh week, I would like to show you one of my main buildings,  created for this scene. This building is not completely procedural, that is, if we change the beginning  or the incoming geometry, the whole setup will not be updated. But since I knew that it would be  just a single building, I did not try to make it completely procedural.  But nevertheless, I would like to show you its setup. I wanted to tell you how the details were created.  Perhaps here you will see some other working processes that we have not had time to discuss,  but they could be useful to you when creating your buildings. Perhaps these will be methods that  you have not even thought of yet. So let's see. This is what this building looks like. I thought  that this is a good example, because this building is cylindrical, it is not square,  like those that we did before. And there are even more interesting and small details here,  unlike the previous buildings. And all because when I was thinking about the layout and setting up the camera,  I knew that I wanted to see this building closer. And so I worked on these details so that if the  camera sees them close, they looked interesting. Well, at least so that these details were there.  Let's take a look at these different layers that I have in this setup and I will tell you how  it was all done. I will go into this node. As you can see, here I have different node groups, everything is divided into parts.  At the beginning there is a pipe of a certain thickness and it is used in the boolean node. Here I have  windows, they are created the same way as before. That is, we cut them out again with the help of geometry, the  bottom part and the top part. Although they are shifted so, look here, that when they are cut out in the boolean  node, we get such a beautiful insert. This is because in many examples, or at least in this  example, it was one of the characteristic features. That is, it turned out such a jumper at the top, these  stones are laid out with an arch on top. In this setup it was important.  On the other hand, the same thing that we did before. We just create a curve  and copy the objects along this curve and then just combine everything.  And notice, instead of copying in a circle, here I used copy and transform. And this node is  associated with the number of segments of this pipe. Look, if I go back here and increase the  number of sections, that is, the number of columns or reduce, then the number of windows will also change.  And it is done very easily, that is, it is set up. I will go to copy and transform.  Here we take the number of columns and divide by 4. And depending on how much you  divide them, you will get more or less windows. But it is important that the rotation is also  associated with the total number of points. Whatever this number is, I want to divide it by 360,  and then the displacement or the number between them will be preserved when changing the total number.  The total number is in turn associated with the columns. Why is this necessary? If I reduce this  number too much, there is less geometry on the walls. And the windows are also added less in this  case, because they are no longer for such low-polygon geometry. That is, we need  exactly such a shape so that we can cut out the windows.  So, this was the first part of this building.  Next, there are additional windows. The setup is exactly the same, I think there is nothing to tell here.  And then a few round windows. Again, a very similar setup, nothing new.  And these bricks are copied in the same way.  And let's move on.  Let's move down. After that, I define the material for this  fragment. And we will talk about the materials in more detail next week.  After that, we just fill in the windows. I wanted to add glass.  Here are the same setups as above. Again, nothing complicated.  And on this side we do everything else. Let's start from here.  And here it is interesting.  I'll start with the window pattern. Here I start with the pipe. I delete everything except the upper face.  I add an insert and create a lot of copies so that such a pattern turns out. And this is what I do  quite often. I can even show you this in another part of the setup.  And then we move to the desired position, transform. Then the copy node, which is associated with others.  If I go here, they will all be similar. They are all connected in one place,  so they all copy the same. And before that, we used this pile to get  this shape. This setup should already be familiar to you.  Here we start with the cylinder and create this shape for the bulle operation.  And again, if I change the columns in the incoming geometry, we will change the whole view of this part.  But the mood is not perfect. Here you will need to correct something so that there are no mistakes.  But this setup works quite well for me in this form. And finally, I have details for the finishing.  Here, again, as we did before, we start with the curve and use the sweep node.  We stretch along it.  Since these will be the details of the finishing, I needed them to have a  curl. If I show UV, you will see that sweep in general creates good curls that can then be used,  but they are too big. Therefore, I needed to reduce them. For this, you need UV transform.  Let's try again.  Well, you see, it reduces here, aligns on the lower edge. Nothing special.  And then we put everything together.  The second merge is another layer only on top. But here I already have a different pattern. Let's see.  But the setup is very similar.  This is another layer. This time we just added balconies. I think it was done in a  similar way. Here we have a copy. Although this time the copy node copies in a circle.  And depending on the breakage, the number of copies changes.  Like this.  And another layer on top.  Oh, no, sorry, we just combine it all. And in the end we add a roof. Let's see.  And creating this roof, I could not work the same way as before because of this complex form.  Here, as it were, the skull is located from top to bottom in the form of a waterfall. It would be difficult to  apply resample here, as well as to change the size of the skull at each level.  So instead, I took the original geometry  and used each face as a separate tile. In the full rich connected pieces cycle,  I first divided them into parts with a bevel node. In general, if I had to do this again,  I would probably make a primitive split node. But it worked the same way.  And thus, by dividing them one by one, we simply change the position, slightly randomizing.  Then this curve finds the left edge, the left edge. And then we extrude it from the polywire.  And then we collect everything together.  Then I take all the lower ribs and lower them a little.  It would probably be possible to group them in advance and do the same.  Well, it looks like I just highlighted them here. This is quite normal.  I know that the input data will never change.  Then on the left side we do the same with the lower row. And at the end we combine everything.  And I also slightly turned them by accident, using the same methods as before.  Well, that's it, it's ready.  In general, this was an example of the main building, and I hope it will be useful for understanding  how to create something similar.  Your homework for this week is to study the procedural setups that I showed you,  and try to apply them to your scene, solve some of your problems.  Next week we will move on to the stage modification. We will collect everything together, add shaders,  lighting, then move on to compositing and bring the final result.
