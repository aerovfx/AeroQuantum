00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:02,630
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,690
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,430
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,724
In this final part of the lecture we're
going to look at the polarizability of

5
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:10,857
the hydrogen atom.

6
00:00:10,857 --> 00:00:14,428
A system in which electron and
an ion move freely,

7
00:00:14,428 --> 00:00:19,616
according to their own equations of
motion in three dimensional space,

8
00:00:19,616 --> 00:00:24,463
much richer system you might think
than the diatomic polar molecule

9
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:29,651
which can be effectively treated as
a rigid rotator, but as we'll see,

10
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:33,989
the concepts that were developed
in of course the molecule,

11
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,171
apply as well to the richer
case of the atom.

12
00:00:39,364 --> 00:00:41,784
I might just mention, parenthetically,

13
00:00:41,784 --> 00:00:45,600
I eluded to some of my own scientific
work in a previous lecture.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,740
I am very interested in the effects of
electric and magnetic fields on matter.

15
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:57,200
This type of approach,
as applied to the hydrogen atom,

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,180
is very similar to research
grade work that is

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,070
done in computing the black body radiation
shifts of optical atomic clocks.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,149
So we're going to go
through a calculation which

19
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:21,138
has to do with finding the response
of an atom to an electric field.

20
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:25,306
It's convenient in these cases
to the work in the CGS units,

21
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:31,353
just because as you'll see, there's a lot
of complicated factors floating around and

22
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:33,823
that simplifies the book keeping.

23
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:38,884
We're going to look at the general
problem of a hydrogen-like ion,

24
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:43,594
which might involve an electron and
a nucleus, it might involve

25
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:49,117
an antiproton and a nucleus, it might
involve an electron and a positron.

26
00:01:49,117 --> 00:01:55,081
The nucleus has a charge of Z times Z,

27
00:01:55,081 --> 00:02:00,330
which Z is conventionally
the atomic number.

28
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,870
The electron nucleus
distance is given by r.

29
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,020
We retain the reduced mass so
that this formula can be used

30
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,960
to describe species other than
electrons found in nuclei.

31
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,340
And we're going to do perturbation theory,

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,140
just of the very same type that we
applied in the diatomic polar molecule.

33
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,515
Slight difference here for
notational convenience, I'm writing this,

34
00:02:29,515 --> 00:02:33,694
the typical conventionally,
is H naught plus lambda V for

35
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:37,800
the Hamiltonian, it's what's being solved.

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,686
So I'm just going to use F,
as the field strength,

37
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:48,711
is equivalent to lambda, and
that means that the perturbation

38
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:53,143
here is just given in
terms of the unit vector,

39
00:02:53,143 --> 00:03:00,445
the scale of the product of the unit
vector with the radius times the charge.

40
00:03:00,445 --> 00:03:04,127
That half means unit vector now.

41
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,306
So here is the Hamiltonian for

42
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:10,151
the hydrogen atom that
we've talked about before.

43
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:16,591
Here is an expression for
the ground state energy,

44
00:03:16,591 --> 00:03:22,132
E naught which is just
the Rydberg formula,

45
00:03:22,132 --> 00:03:29,190
but with finite mass and
the square of a nuclear charge.

46
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,600
And then here is a wave function that
was introduced in a previous lecture.

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,920
This time it's correctly normalized.

48
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,325
I don't know why I had the wrong
expression before, but

49
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:46,963
this is the normalized ground state
wave function of a hydrogenic ion.

50
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:51,399
Where this length scale,

51
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:56,200
this, it's very close.

52
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:03,721
If mu were the electron mass and
Z would equal the one,

53
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:09,416
this would be the vor radius, a naught.

54
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,356
But now,
we'd retain it as general form so that we

55
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:17,032
can deal with particles of arbitrary
mass and of arbitrary nuclear charge.

56
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:21,050
So there's a lot of symbols
floating around here and

57
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,458
the mathematics does get fairly involved.

58
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:30,144
But we're going to take a fairly high
level view, and I'll show you what you

59
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:34,756
need to do to actually perform
the calculations in detail, should you so

60
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:35,372
choose.

61
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:43,938
Now as usual, the very first thing we do,
because all of the ingredients are laid

62
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:47,040
out, so
we calculate the first order energy.

63
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,550
I always love doing this because usually

64
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,850
it's the easiest step in the problem and
leads to useful results.

65
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,830
So here, I've written it out in its full
glory, the first order energy which is

66
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:07,680
just the expectation value
of the perturbing potential

67
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,020
over the square density
of the wave function.

68
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,554
Now I would like you to look at that and

69
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:24,094
see if you come up with any easy
ways of performing that integral.

70
00:05:24,094 --> 00:05:26,635
Okay, I hope that you saw that.

71
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:30,270
Again, this is an interval
that vanishes by symmetry.

72
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,158
If you started to write this out and

73
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:39,521
try to evaluate it by long
hand without noticing

74
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:46,245
the essential symmetry property,
it could be laborious.

75
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:49,898
And I'd just emphasize that many of them,
basically,

76
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:55,185
all of the electrical field problems that
one encounters in quantum mechanics,

77
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:57,536
tend to have this generic feature.

78
00:05:57,536 --> 00:06:04,136
In other words,
if you have this is potential,

79
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:08,922
this interaction potential, v,

80
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:11,906
is odd under parity.

81
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:17,740
If you invert the coordinates,

82
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,460
the potential changes sign, and so
that if you're integrating that

83
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,470
over a symmetric density,
the integral necessarily vanishes.

84
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,455
Okay, well, we got that easy part
of the calculation out of the way,

85
00:06:38,455 --> 00:06:41,890
the determination of
the first order energy.

86
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,150
So now we come to what is really
the most difficult and that is

87
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,612
the solution of this equation, the first
order equation for the wave function.

88
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,735
This is more complicated than the one
that we had for the diatomic molecule.

89
00:06:57,735 --> 00:07:03,360
Because, see here is
the usual left-hand side,

90
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,550
which has a Hamiltonian operator
that's got Laplacian and

91
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,780
coordinate function in it.

92
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,060
And then on the right-hand side, I guess
you can see the crux of the issue now, is

93
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,950
that we have two variables,
the radius and the angle.

94
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,102
In the diatomic molecule,

95
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:32,136
we didn't have the degree of freedom and
radial coordinate.

96
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:36,975
This makes the equation much more complex,

97
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:41,158
but there is a saving factor, again,

98
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:45,760
associated with the angular momentum.

99
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,825
So recall that one again, the H naught is
the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom.

100
00:07:52,825 --> 00:07:59,400
It's completely, spherically symmetric and
it is being applied to thus psi 1,

101
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,400
and the result is something
that's asymmetric, so

102
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,735
I emphasize that means that
the asymmetry is present in psi 1.

103
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:12,280
It's revealed by the action of h naught,
but it is not created by it.

104
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,544
So that means we know that psi
1 has to have this particular,

105
00:08:20,544 --> 00:08:25,818
again this is a y 1,
0 harmonic embedded in it,

106
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:30,836
and if you go back and
look at the Hamiltonian,

107
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:36,113
you'll see that there's
a del squared function

108
00:08:36,113 --> 00:08:40,875
of which the cosine
theta is an Eigenvalue,

109
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:44,120
and then also this part here.

110
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,577
The fact that the cosine theta is
accompanied by a single power of r,

111
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:55,697
guarantees that the behavior
of this function near

112
00:08:55,697 --> 00:09:00,583
the origin will be consistent
with this powerful property,

113
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:07,196
the angular momentum operator in that
the angular momentum completely dominates

114
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:13,838
the motion of the particle at very small
distances from the coordinate of origin.

115
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:19,088
So whenever you see
the cosine theta at small r,

116
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:24,077
this, what's called characteristic value

117
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:28,290
of the radius, must also be present.

118
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,550
Now this is more like a matter
of experience because

119
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:39,671
of the long range profile
of an exponential decay,

120
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:45,735
you need to have that present
in the envelope of psi 1,

121
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:51,560
and then the remaining part is
a radial function in order to keep

122
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,370
the angular character
consistent with the cosine.

123
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,816
So this is the description
of the analytical steps

124
00:10:01,816 --> 00:10:08,400
that are needed to get
an appropriate form of the solution.

125
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,379
Now the determination
of f is another matter,

126
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,855
which we'll discuss on the next slide.

127
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:29,633
So again, here's the analytic
supposition that we wrote down for

128
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:34,674
the first order wave function and
with this in hand,

129
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:39,715
it's not difficult to show
that f must satisfy, but

130
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:45,234
is proportional to this rather
simple linear function.

131
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:49,926
Again, I think those of you
who like working out real

132
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:54,834
quantum mechanics problems,
this is perhaps the most

133
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:59,860
involved one that has been
offered during this course.

134
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:06,170
And perhaps you can get a glimpse of
that from this crazy looking solution.

135
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,781
Yes, that is a power of h bar
to the 6th and the 6th power of

136
00:11:10,781 --> 00:11:15,800
the electric charge and
the third power of the reduced mass.

137
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,260
I think that's probably more analytically

138
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,710
interesting than many of the results
that you've seen so far.

139
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,920
This does have a dimension of volume.

140
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,790
Welcome to check that,

141
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:39,233
keeping mind that e is in the CGS system.

142
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:46,220
So in other words e squared over
r has the dimensions of energy.

143
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,180
Now there is something I want
to draw your attention to.

144
00:11:58,512 --> 00:12:05,810
It's the behavior of the polarizability of
hydrogen as the plot constant goes to 0.

145
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,421
I mean, as if we could set
the plot at constant 0, but

146
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:10,980
this is the limit of classical mechanics.

147
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,980
And so what you see is that, in this
limit, the polarizability goes to 0.

148
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,608
So in other words in a classical world,
the hydrogen atom would not

149
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:25,500
respond to an electric field at all,
it'd just be too tightly bound.

150
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,030
And this is consistent, I think,

151
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,860
with the idea that you'd have in
the Bohr model that if the quantum of

152
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,960
action plots constant were smaller,
the radius of the atom would shrink and

153
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,435
shrink and shrink and
the electron would become so tight,

154
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:47,410
would become ever more tightly bound,
the polarizability would go to 0.

155
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:52,150
So this shows, really, the opposite effect

156
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:57,220
in the transition of the classical limit
that we saw for the polar molecule.

157
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,206
And one of the home work problems this
week, which was actually suggested by one

158
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:08,879
of the students, or at least I interpreted
their remarks as a suggestion,

159
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:14,670
shows, well I don't want to reveal the
answer, but just say, the behavior of that

160
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,340
problem, which is relevant to trapping of
atoms in the Earth's gravitational field

161
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,140
is, I'll just say, not exactly
the same as either of these two cases.

162
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,150
Okay, so that's a good introduction
to perturbation theory.

163
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,740
I realize it's brief and
of an overview nature, but

164
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,730
we've used it to attack some real
