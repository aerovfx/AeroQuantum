00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,530
Hello everyone,
welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:04,370
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,070
And in this part of the lecture, we're
going to take a venture into the realm of

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,850
perturbation theory, very powerful tool.

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,290
And particularly,
we're going to look at it in

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:17,680
the context of understanding electrical
properties of neutral matter.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,380
Okay, just to remind you,

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,120
we're looking at the properties of
a sort of a test case potassium rubidium

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,296
molecule, which is of interest in
multiple common [INAUDIBLE] of physics.

10
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,130
And at the end of the previous part,
we got to the realization that,

11
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,538
no, the ground rotational
state of the molecule,

12
00:00:40,538 --> 00:00:44,260
its dipole moment, is oriented randomly.

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,420
And so there's no net dipole moment,
we want to orient it.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,360
And how do we do that?

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,990
Well, we're going to apply
an electric field to the system and

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,230
see what changes that causes according
to the picture of quantum mechanics.

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,660
The tool we're going to use is
called perturbation theory.

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,380
It's a very powerful tool.

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,160
Actually, in the form that we use it now,
it was original developed by Schrodinger.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:19,410
At least, it was used in almost the very
same form that we use it today in his

21
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,970
early papers on the hydrogen atom, in
which he deduces not just the spectrum of

22
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,620
a hydrogen atom, but the response of
that spectrum to an electric field.

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,460
It's a very versatile and
powerful tool, of quantum theory, and

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:41,920
also if you do a search on the phrase
perturbation theory, you'll find that

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,170
is a very powerful to applied mathematical
analysis in a more general context.

26
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,100
So I think the lessons that you learn from
working examples in perturbation theory

27
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,760
are widely useful no matter what
your analytical interests are,

28
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,110
because here's the basic idea.

29
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,320
Let's suppose that we're
solving an equation

30
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:13,060
of promotion of a very complex form
perhaps is given by a Hamiltonian

31
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,500
which has a lot of complexity and
we donâ€™t know how to solve the equation.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,900
So the idea of perturbation theory is,

33
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,750
that you try to find
an approximation to that

34
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,928
real Hamiltonian in terms of a Hamiltonian
whose properties you know how to solve.

35
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:37,770
And where the equations

36
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,389
of motion that you're really
interested in can be reached

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,890
To some degree by an expansion
in a small parameter.

38
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,324
And so the idea is that you

39
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:58,460
take a known Hamiltonian and its spectrum.

40
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,530
And then you seek to develop,

41
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,110
in a systematic way, the description
of the new equations of motion.

42
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,430
In terms of the power series

43
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,890
in a set of functions that
can be computed iteratively.

44
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:21,120
I should say that very often it is,
it's not necessary

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,680
to go much higher than 1 or
2 in this series in order to.

46
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,378
Actually learn very useful things.

47
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,910
So we're going to work a couple examples.

48
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,880
Here's the basic formulas, and as I showed
you before, we say, well, the Hamiltonian

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,000
consists of the two part,
the known one and then something else.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,970
We're now going to focus on solving
the time-independent Schrodinger

51
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,560
equation by this technique.

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,208
So we want to find the energy associated
with this composite Hamiltonian.

53
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:05,064
Now we do that by expanding both
the wave function psi here and

54
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:13,180
the energy E in terms of
a formal power series in lambda.

55
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,520
And then we just plug these two
expressions back into the equation and

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,250
we match the power supply
in a setting order.

57
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,199
So again I hope you can see that, so

58
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,321
we have H naught plus lambda v naught

59
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:40,321
times psi naught plus
lambda psi 1 plus etc etc,

60
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:45,784
equals E naught, plus lambda E 1 plus

61
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:50,585
etc psi 0 plus lambda psi 1 etc.

62
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:55,920
So let's match the powers
of lambda to the 0.

63
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:00,180
So that means we take h0
times psi 0 from here.

64
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:07,580
There's no other match and then on
the other side we have E on sign on there.

65
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,120
So let's just run a reality check and
see if that makes sense to you.

66
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,050
So I hope your persuaded by
looking at it that at least this

67
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,840
first equation makes a lot
of sense because it just

68
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,040
gives one back the spectrum which
one presumably knows how to control.

69
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,560
Well now, let's see, how do we go up?

70
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,370
Let's go to the next order.

71
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:43,396
So, we're just taking powers of
lambda through the 1 on each side.

72
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:50,724
Lambda the 1, so from the left hand side,

73
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:55,407
that's h0 times psi 1 + V

74
00:05:55,407 --> 00:06:01,108
times psi 0 = E0 times psi 1 and

75
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:04,991
then E1 times psi 0.

76
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,634
Okay, well, so far there's not much,

77
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:17,753
not much going on just it's symbolism so
now let's,

78
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:21,960
what we do now is we
take the matrix element,

79
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,880
the bra of size zero with
respect of this equation.

80
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,080
So zero on this, on both sides.

81
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,480
And so we now get this expression here and

82
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:46,170
I hope it's clear to you that
when we look at this term here.

83
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:54,320
That's exactly equal to this term by
the formation conjugation process.

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,260
So, we can drop these two terms.

85
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:04,910
And then we get this simple equation for
the first order energy correction.

86
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:13,070
It's just the expectation value of
the potential over the 0 wave function.

87
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,840
My good friend and colleague,
Mark Edwards, call this

88
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,910
the most used equation in quantum theory
which I think very well may be right.

89
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,720
It's not the most written
equation quantum theory,

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,250
which is the Schrodinger equation,
but this is one which is probably

91
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,580
solved more often than anything
else because it really gives one

92
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,320
a very good guidance at an early
stage on what you have to do.

93
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:47,160
And it really just requires taking
an integral of something rather

94
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,730
than solving a spectral problem.

95
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,060
So we're going to do some
of that solving ourselves.

96
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:01,340
Okay, so I guess you can see that there's
some sense that you get in making some,

97
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,240
looking at simple considerations
of standard problems when,

98
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,560
the trivial sort of attempts that we
apply we see the perturbation theory.

99
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,470
Describes that case well.

100
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,220
Okay, so now, we're going to go to
the real problem, which is to try and

101
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,330
understand the properties of
a rotating polar molecule

102
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,770
in the presence of an electric field.

103
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,646
So here's our Hamiltonian you see.

104
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:33,104
It's the original rotational
Hamiltonian with another term which

105
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:39,526
is the interaction of an electric dipole
moment, d, with the electric field.

106
00:08:39,526 --> 00:08:45,923
This is the interaction from
classical electrostatics and so

107
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:52,203
we can write this in simply in
polar coordinates in this way.

108
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:56,761
And now I'm using these temperature

109
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:01,325
equivalents just for convenience.

110
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:06,672
So there's a sort of, keep in mind this is
just a temperature equivalent saying well,

111
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:10,262
you have an energy and
you divide it by both cost and

112
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:14,680
that gives a temperature but it does
describe the scale in a useful way.

113
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,630
As you may recall, this equivalent
temperature of the rotational motion in

114
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,578
the ground state is something like
55 millielectron, millikelvin.

115
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:31,180
And now with using a sort of
a dimensionalist parameter which

116
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:37,600
is a field strength of 1 volt per meter,
then there's an equivalent electrical

117
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
energy, which it turns out is very small
compared to the rotational energy.

118
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,780
So this is a sign that
a perturbation theoretic approach

119
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:53,220
will be useful in this problem because we
are using it to treat something that's

120
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,970
small compared to the underlying
rotational motion, the molecule.

121
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,580
And you might well imagine
from a physical standpoint.

122
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,150
If you have a molecule that's
freely rotating and you're just,

123
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,020
you just have a small break to
apply to try to slow it down.

124
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,476
That when that break is weak,
it's not going to be that effective.

125
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:23,380
So here we go on our way
to solving this problem.

126
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,090
We have the E0 vanishes,
here's the 0th order.

127
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,236
Wave function sign on, it's just
the ground state of rotating molecule.

128
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:38,762
So now we're going to evaluate the most
used equation in quantum physics,

129
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:43,678
the first order energy It's
the expectation value potential over

130
00:10:43,678 --> 00:10:46,150
the ground state wave function.

131
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,180
And now you see this is just,

132
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,645
the potential is just the cosine of
the angle with respect to the axes.

133
00:10:54,645 --> 00:11:01,705
So our expectation value takes this form.

134
00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:07,815
Now, I hope that through the exercises
that you've done throughout this course,

135
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:10,346
you've learned that sometimes,

136
00:11:10,346 --> 00:11:16,580
you don't actually need to go through
the mechanics of evaluating integral.

137
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,860
It vanishes because of symmetry reason,

138
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,740
and this equals 0 for
a very simple reason and that is, it's

139
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,019
an integral over all space of the cosine
of an angle with respect to some axis.

140
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,044
The cosine of this angle here and
well obviously the cosine

141
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:43,042
of that angle whatever point you
have here there's another point

142
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:49,276
where the cosine has it an ultimate
sign so this vanishes by symmetry

143
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:58,259
Which is quite a common
occurrence when evaluating first

144
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,668
order energy corrections of this type,
as we'll see.
