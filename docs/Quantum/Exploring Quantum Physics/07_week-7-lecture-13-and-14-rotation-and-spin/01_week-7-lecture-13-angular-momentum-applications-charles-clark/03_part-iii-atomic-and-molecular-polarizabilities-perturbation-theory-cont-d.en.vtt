00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.180
Hello everyone welcome back to exploring
quantum physics, I'm Charles Clark.

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.260
We're going to continue our
discussion of the dynamics of,

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.520
rotating polar molecule in electric field.

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:22.749
Okay, so were just pursuing
perturbation theory the usual form and

5
00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:28.040
we found the order Eigen functions,

6
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.390
we knew those already.

7
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.350
We evaluated the first zero and so
now we continue to the next order.

8
00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:48.213
So again, what we did in this example so

9
00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:53.140
far was determine the zeroth-order wave
function, the zeroth-order energy and

10
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.310
then the first-order energy which is
again, it's just a problem of quadrature.

11
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.160
So whatever difficulty you have in doing

12
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.570
integrals, integration is in many
respects a mechanical procedure.

13
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.080
You can easily find the miracle
techniques in many cases and will do for

14
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.270
if we don't have to evaluate.

15
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.520
Now the next step is to get
the first order wave function side.

16
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.180
One, and
that is rather different undertaking.

17
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.490
So here is the equation that defines
the 1st order wave function.

18
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.070
And, I prefer to write
it in this way here.

19
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.771
This is the defining equation of psi 1 and
so

20
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:46.103
you see it satisfies An inhomogeneous.

21
00:01:51.352 --> 00:01:57.373
Sorry, inhomogeneous linear equation.

22
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.360
Which depends upon sign on.

23
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.090
Now important point to know that

24
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.980
we're going to go on calculate sci one for
a particular case in a moment just to show

25
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.150
you how that's done but once you have sci
one and hand once you have all those hand.

26
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.780
ANd then let's see to try to go
through this without getting

27
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.290
too bogged down in it.

28
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.500
This is the second order equation.

29
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.340
That is the first equation
in which e two appears for

30
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.870
the second order, energy and you see that
there's a second order wave function

31
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.820
as well as a first order zero over
m zero throw it away function.

32
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.023
But once again, when we apply the bra

33
00:02:43.023 --> 00:02:47.767
sine aught to both side of this equation,

34
00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:52.782
then I hope you can see
that this term here and

35
00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:57.993
that term Cancel.

36
00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:04.050
They're the same because
of the formation property.

37
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.980
We're left with this term.

38
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.109
This term vanishes or let me just say

39
00:03:19.136 --> 00:03:24.276
This term is necessarily
orthogonal because

40
00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:31.070
of the orthogonal sign ons [INAUDIBLE] or
if we have E1=0.

41
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.250
Then it turns out that
this term goes away.

42
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.331
And so
we're left with an equation where E2,

43
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:50.610
which that that E2 passes through and
sine 0 is normalized.

44
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.850
Here's the important equation for the
second-order energy, it's just equal to

45
00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.900
the matrix element the potential operating
on the first order wave function.

46
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.630
Projected back onto the 0th order.

47
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.220
So this is the second order energy, is
something that defines response functions,

48
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.530
generally useful, and
that's our target for today.

49
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.109
Now, here's how we're going to solve

50
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.560
the equation for
the first-order perturbe function

51
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.880
which we need in order to get
the lowest non-vanishing energy.

52
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.470
Since we saw that
the first-order energy vanished.

53
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.050
We have to get up to find
something interesting.

54
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.090
So once again, here's the 0th
order Hamiltonian, the potential.

55
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.140
0th order energy and
the 0th order wave function, and

56
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.320
we've established that the 1st
order energy also vanishes.

57
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.004
So now it's relatively straight
forward to write down the equation for

58
00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:00.208
sine one because e0 is 0.

59
00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:05.430
And this the left hand side of the
equation is the angular momentum operator

60
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.920
apply to sine one, is this ratio of
the strengths of the two interactions,

61
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.322
which comes from these
two terms respectively.

62
00:05:18.322 --> 00:05:22.940
And then here you see there is an angle,
the cos of theta and

63
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.130
the normalization,
1 / square root of 4 pi.

64
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.000
Well this means, you see since the,

65
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.370
the angular momentum operator
is spherically symmetric.

66
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.730
It's rotationally symmetric.

67
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.980
When it operates on side one
it returns a particular angle.

68
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.910
That means that we should expect

69
00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.180
the angular behavior of the wave
function to be embedded in psi one.

70
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.810
It's only going to be revealed by
the angular momentum operator,

71
00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.090
which is spherically symmetric.

72
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.390
It's not going to be imposed by it.

73
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.040
And, indeed, it turns out that cosine
theta is a spherical harmonic with M = 1.

74
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.080
I think you can see that.

75
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:27.220
That's just because a cosine theta is x
three over r so it satisfies our neumatic,

76
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.540
x three is a solution to cross
the equation as is x three of r.

77
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.120
And it's, this actually, this L,

78
00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:43.840
L is the polynomial order

79
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:51.140
of that expression that we were looking
at earlier first part of this lecture.

80
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.820
So then, it then follows
that the first order of way

81
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.440
function is [INAUDIBLE]
four.

82
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.440
So you see in this case the existence of
the understanding of angular momentum.

83
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.740
Enables us to solve the first order

84
00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.770
equation in a relatively
straight forward way.

85
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.980
Okay, so we've solved for
the first order wave function and

86
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.965
we can now compute the second order energy
by this simple formula and well, okay,

87
00:07:22.965 --> 00:07:29.415
so this number, maybe this number
doesn't mean anything in and of itself.

88
00:07:29.415 --> 00:07:37.980
But let's just ask what it means from the
standpoint of classical electrodynamics.

89
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:43.090
As we'll see,
this describes a very important quality,

90
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:52.050
the polarizability of a molecule.

91
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:57.070
So in electrostatics you learn about
the properties of material objects

92
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:02.330
when their expose to electromagnetic
fields and one of the classic

93
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:09.570
problems concerned a conducting
sphere of some finite radius

94
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.798
which you put in an electric field and

95
00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:19.570
then that result in the sphere
acquire in an electric dipole moment.

96
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:24.390
So there is a re distribution
of charges on the sphere with

97
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.560
the positive charges on one side and
the negative charges on the other.

98
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.310
And this is an empirical long.

99
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.630
There was understood about the electrical
properties matter in ancient time before

100
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:46.720
there was any known quantitative theory,
how matter response to electricity.

101
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.670
And so it turns out that there's
a very useful convention.

102
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:57.280
The relationship of the, for weak fields

103
00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.950
as a linear response to the dipole moment
induced by an applied electric field

104
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:09.040
Is just proportional to this constant
that's characteristic of the object for

105
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:12.080
which for a conducting sphere
is just the cube of its radius.

106
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.710
And that where we use the c.g.s.

107
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.948
Units for the electric field charges.

108
00:09:19.624 --> 00:09:26.060
Now, as it happens it's easy to show
this from the defining relations.

109
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:30.160
The relationship and the polarizability
and the second order energy.

110
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.300
Is just given in these simple terms.

111
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.600
So this means we can now
use quantum mechanics to

112
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.080
describe the polarized ability of matter.

113
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.550
It's really the first and
to date only fundamental theory

114
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:51.260
that allows us to understand electrical
properties from first principles.

115
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.930
So when we apply it to
this potassium molecule,

116
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:59.470
we find that the polarized ability
in the ground state is given by this

117
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:07.000
expression and this again has
the dimensions of volume, so it

118
00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.710
looks like a conducted sphere of that.

119
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:21.940
25.
Two and a half nanometers in radius.

120
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.280
I'm just using this as
a measure of a number.

121
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.900
I want you to know the following
interesting Interesting to me.

122
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.230
The polarizability which is

123
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.490
the ratio of the induced dipole
moment to the applied field strength,

124
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.130
actually diverges as one
goes to the classical limit.

125
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:52.634
Taking h bar and going to zero,
so for a rotating molecule,

126
00:10:52.634 --> 00:10:57.057
if we, if we lived in a classical world,

127
00:10:57.057 --> 00:11:01.352
a polarizability would be infinite and

128
00:11:01.352 --> 00:11:06.685
that I think you can see is for
a rotating molecule

129
00:11:06.685 --> 00:11:12.434
of the If there were no
energy cost of localization,

130
00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:21.310
Which is due to the uncertainty principle,
then the the dipole

131
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.840
moment will be localized Instantly
by even the smallest field.

132
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:36.150
So this shows the least as concerns
the behavior of a rotating polar molecule,

133
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:41.740
the electrical polarized ability of
matter is definitely a quantum effect.

134
00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:49.200
That is, it ceases exist when and
h bar goes to 0.

135
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.570
We're going to see another example of
that, actually very different type in

136
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.930
the next part of the slide.
