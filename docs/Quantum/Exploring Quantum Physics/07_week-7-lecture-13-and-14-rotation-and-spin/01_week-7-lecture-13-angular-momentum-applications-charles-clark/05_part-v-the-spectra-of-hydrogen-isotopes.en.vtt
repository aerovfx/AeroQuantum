00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.700
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.800
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.380
We're going to conclude this lecture by
another application of pertubation theory

5
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.378
to a problem that can be solved exactly,
important problem.

6
00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:16.185
But this will show you how you can use
pertubation theory to test against

7
00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:20.070
a result to see if you're getting
the right answer in the leading order.

8
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.872
We now return to a problem
that we studied previously,

9
00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:28.358
the spectra of the isotopes of hydrogen.

10
00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:31.447
But we're going to approach it from
the standpoint of perturbation theory

11
00:00:31.447 --> 00:00:33.810
rather than a direct solution
of the SchrÃ¶der equation.

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.700
So this is a fairly important problem,
the history of science,

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.610
and it's a useful testing ground for

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.550
perturbation theory because we do have
available to us an exact solution.

15
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.290
So we can compare perturbation
theory in the limit.

16
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.858
And then, perturbation theory also gives
us some guidance as to how to approach

17
00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:03.530
the problem of multi-electron atoms, where
the isotope shifts are also important.

18
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.778
But where there typically is not
an easily tractable solution available.

19
00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:10.819
Certainly not an exact solution.

20
00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.350
And the basic idea,
as you recall on perturbation theory,

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.115
there's a small parameter,

22
00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:20.366
and we take that to be the ratio of
the electron mass to the nuclear mass.

23
00:01:23.738 --> 00:01:25.178
So let's start.

24
00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:29.271
We have the electronic coordinates,
the mass, the position, the momentum,

25
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:32.160
the designated the the same for
the nucleus.

26
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.230
Mass capital M, and its own position.

27
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.050
It's a two particle system.

28
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.090
The Hamiltonian consists of
the electron kinetic energy,

29
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.299
the nuclear kinetic energy, and
then the interaction potential.

30
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.120
Now we split this up into
two pieces shown here.

31
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.500
The one in the red box contains
the electron kinetic energy and

32
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.210
the interaction energy.

33
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.110
And then the term in the blue box
is the nuclear kinetic energy.

34
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.789
The energy of motion of the nucleus.

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.620
And we have chosen to extract
the small parameter by this method so

36
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.486
that we get an equation that looks like
the beginning of the perturbation theory.

37
00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:22.171
We have a 0 total Hamiltonian,
and then a small quantity,

38
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:28.390
which we'll conventionally call
lambda times another potential.

39
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.167
And here are the values of that small
parameter for the several stable or

40
00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.722
nearly stable isotopes of hydrogen.

41
00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:39.069
A protium is the name for
electron bound to a proton,

42
00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.013
mass one, mass proton mass, deuterium,
electron bound to a deuteron, and

43
00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:46.770
tritium, the electron bound to a triton.

44
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.680
Nuclear mass is roughly in the ratio one,
two, three.

45
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.130
To tell you the truth,

46
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.700
I can never remember the equations
of perturbation theory.

47
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.648
I always return to first principles,
which are defined by this equation.

48
00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:09.081
And the basic idea is you have
some model Hamiltonian and

49
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:15.860
then a correction to it, which is
proportional to the parameter lambda.

50
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.197
And then both the wave function and

51
00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:21.588
the energy are to be expanded
in powers of lambda.

52
00:03:21.588 --> 00:03:26.178
And so you just put these things in and
expand away.

53
00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:29.330
And it's very easy to
generate the various terms.

54
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.410
So here's the zeroth order.

55
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.250
Here's the term that's first
order in lambda and so on.

56
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.260
Now in previous examples
on perturbation theory,

57
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.360
we were focused mostly on
the second order of energy shifts.

58
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.250
But in this case, we have a concrete
application of the first order energy,

59
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.590
which happens to not to
vanish in this system and

60
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.670
gives the leading correction
to the energy levels.

61
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.925
So back to our defining equations,

62
00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:07.511
now let's do an explicit construction
of the zeroth order solution.

63
00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:12.507
So the value of our coupling
concept lambda goes to zero in

64
00:04:12.507 --> 00:04:16.370
the limit of nuclear
mass goes to infinity.

65
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.310
So we just take that limit, and

66
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.490
we choose the coordinate origin to
be the position of the nucleus.

67
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.750
Then we get our h nought solely in
terms of the variables of the electron.

68
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.270
And we're going to solve this equation.

69
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.036
So now a brief in-video quiz
to give you an opportunity to

70
00:04:37.036 --> 00:04:40.878
understand what this
equation really means.

71
00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:47.524
So, I hope that in thinking about that,

72
00:04:47.524 --> 00:04:52.691
you came to the conclusion that E0,
well, first of all,

73
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:59.880
that it is an energy of the hydrogen
atom with an infinite nuclear mass.

74
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.200
And that, in fact,
it can be any such energy.

75
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.550
In other words, although perturbation
theory is often applied to the ground

76
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.520
states of systems,
it's not restricted to those.

77
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.530
And, in this case, we can apply to any
Eigenfunction of the original Hamiltonian.

78
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:24.500
That is, to a state with any principal
quantum number greater than or

79
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.460
equal to one.

80
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.046
This is very important because it
allows us to calculate the isotope

81
00:05:31.046 --> 00:05:36.145
shift of a transition wavelength or
a transition frequency,

82
00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:42.628
which is the difference in the isotope
shifts of two different energy levels.

83
00:05:42.628 --> 00:05:47.606
So it's really critical that we be able
to apply perturbation theory to any

84
00:05:47.606 --> 00:05:50.698
level in order to get
a result that's useful.

85
00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:58.743
So, we have available to us the E0, and

86
00:05:58.743 --> 00:06:04.470
the sine 0 can be obtained by
solving the infinite mass equation.

87
00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:10.510
So now we are to evaluate the first
order energy, and so, there it is,

88
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.890
it's the nuclear kinetic energy evaluated
over an electronic wave function.

89
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.359
How are we going to handle that?

90
00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:28.308
Well, it's always convenient to choose
a good coordinate reference frame.

91
00:06:28.308 --> 00:06:32.998
And if we use the center of mass
frame then we have this very

92
00:06:32.998 --> 00:06:37.983
useful identity that the momentum
of the nucleus is equal and

93
00:06:37.983 --> 00:06:42.310
opposite to the momentum of the electron.

94
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.643
So now we've converted that
expectation value into one

95
00:06:46.643 --> 00:06:50.246
that involves electronic coordinates only.

96
00:06:53.858 --> 00:06:58.437
And what's more,
by use of the virial theorem,

97
00:06:58.437 --> 00:07:03.688
we don't even need to do
an explicit calculation of that

98
00:07:03.688 --> 00:07:08.717
matrix element because we
showed previously that for

99
00:07:08.717 --> 00:07:13.409
the 1 over r potential,
the expectation value of

100
00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:18.324
the average kinetic energy,
which is what this is,

101
00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:22.823
is just equal and
opposite to the total energy.

102
00:07:26.218 --> 00:07:32.420
So, now we can complete the calculation,
the first order in little m over big M.

103
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.920
So, the energy is just E0 + lambda E1, and

104
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:45.460
E1 is minus E0, so we get this result for
the energy level shift.

105
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.940
So at this point maybe you
should pause and verify that

106
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.610
these two results are in
agreement to first order in

107
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.750
the ratio of electrons to nuclear mass,
which is the goal of the exercise.

108
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.376
So this use of the virial theorem
is something that is also takes

109
00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:12.870
place in modern calculations
of the of many electron atoms.

110
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.170
Because typically,
one doesn't have any exact answers and

111
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.240
perturbation theory is
the only way to make progress.

112
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.130
Okay, that's it for this lecture,
hope to see you again soon.
