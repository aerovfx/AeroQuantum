00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.580
Hello everyone welcome back
to exploring quantum physics.

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.760
I'm Charles Clark, and in this lecture
we're going to use the theory of

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.750
Angular Momentum to understand how
matter interacts with electric fields.

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.670
In our previous lecture we looked
at the role of angular momentum.

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.830
In terms of this contribution to
the kinetic energy of a free particle.

6
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.600
So, just to recall what we showed was,
that, here's the kinetic energy operator,

7
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.760
for a particle moving in three dimensions,
squared.

8
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.600
And this turns out to break
down into a part that

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.890
just depends upon the distance from the
coordinate origin, spherical symmetric,

10
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.370
and then a contribution of
the angular momentum operator.

11
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.600
Which is dependent upon the angles, the
directions in space that a particle makes.

12
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.710
In fact,

13
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.500
you're probably familiar with, an instance
of this in a somewhat different context.

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.700
And that is for
the case of a rigid rotator in space.

15
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.020
So in classical mechanics,
the kinetic energy of a rigid rotator

16
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.010
of mass, M, and radius,

17
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.090
R, Is given by this,
its L squared over 2Mr squared.

18
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.490
And, so,
if we look at a simple rotating molecule

19
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.530
with two massive pieces, then we get
this expression for the kinetic energy,

20
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.000
just the square of the angular momentum
divided by twice the reduced mass and

21
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.570
the distance between these two
other masses taken as points.

22
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.920
And you can easily derive this
just by looking at the kinetic

23
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.000
energy of the two particles
as they rotate but

24
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.340
are constrained to move
at a constant distance.

25
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.340
It turns out that this is a rather
good approximation for the rotational.

26
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.680
Motions of molecules which hare very
important in say thermodynamics and gases.

27
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.290
The rotational motor of a molecule
is sort of lowest energy

28
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.260
beyond just simple translation, and

29
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.010
the rotational states of molecules
coming into great interest.

30
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.810
In the particular context of
production of altered code molecules

31
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.530
for study of quantum gases.

32
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.888
So we're going to look at an example
that is based on one such molecule,

33
00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:44.970
potassium-rubidium and understand
what the rotational dynamics for

34
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.740
that system are also in
the previous lecture we

35
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:56.460
introduced a system of a set of special
function the spherical harmonics

36
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.490
which we generally useful for
describing states of angular momentum.

37
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.390
Here's a conventional definition,
notation and

38
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.310
you can find more information about
these in the, this particular section.

39
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.070
The digital library of
mathematical functions.

40
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.150
Now just as you saw that the role of
angular momentum for a free particle

41
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.780
is very similar to its role for
a constrained system of particles.

42
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.880
It turns out that for
describing angular motion

43
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.520
this set of functions has a sort
of universal applicability.

44
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.150
Many branches of physics
describe wave motion optics

45
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.580
electrodynamics theory of elasticity and
so on.

46
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.650
And I'm not going to dwell In depth
of the properties of these functions.

47
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.730
But you should know a little
bit about the simple ones, and

48
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.190
the general things that
they make possible.

49
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.620
So basically,

50
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.820
you can think of these as a set of
functions that's useful for describing

51
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.420
variations of any type of function
defined on the surface of a sphere.

52
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.040
So they're defined.

53
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:15.350
In terms of the polar
coordinates of three dimensions,

54
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.064
the polar angle theta and the angle phi.

55
00:04:21.064 --> 00:04:24.420
They're the indices index L,

56
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.190
which represents the magnitude of angular
momentum goes from 0 to infinity.

57
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.720
And then m which is
a projection of that projection

58
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.880
of m particular chosen axis,
typically the z axis or

59
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.180
x three axis runs from line to cell to l.

60
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.140
Now if you just open a book and
look at expressions for

61
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.790
circle harmonics They can tend
to be a little bit confusing.

62
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.300
So I'm going to give you a useful
mnemonic to thinking about them.

63
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.410
Basically, you can always
think of a spherical harmonic

64
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.260
in terms of the generalized polynomial.

65
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.377
That is, it consists of,products
of the three coordinates,

66
00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:16.552
x1, x2, x3, where the net power,
a plus b plus c,

67
00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:22.550
is equal to l,
the index of the spherical harmonic.

68
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.290
All divided by an inverse power,
r to the minus l.

69
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.920
So you see this is dimensionless says this

70
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.780
is inverse units of length the alpha
this is inverse units of length.

71
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.620
And furthermore the spherical
harmonics all obey this relation.

72
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.460
So in other words if you take the
Laplacian and apply it to the numerator

73
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.430
here Then, it vanishes.

74
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.510
Now you might ask how helpful this is.

75
00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.410
Well, I think you'll see quickly that
this enables you to test whether

76
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.650
something is spherical harmonic and even
to be constructive in creating your own.

77
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.987
So you see for the low order
harmonics l equals zero, one, and

78
00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:15.860
two, you can quickly recognize them
just by applying the Laplacian and

79
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.120
you can even make your own
to suit your own purposes.

80
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.710
That is you can form a polynomials that
will suit your particulars at the moment.

81
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.520
From just more or
less arbitrary hours coordinates.

82
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:41.582
So I'd like to also note another important
result of this definition is that,

83
00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:46.560
you see all the spherical
mnemonics of a degree l have

84
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.538
a net power of l In the cartesian
coordinates, and so

85
00:06:51.538 --> 00:06:56.632
that means that under
inversion of all coordinates,

86
00:06:56.632 --> 00:07:02.063
the circle harmonics either
remain the same if L is even or

87
00:07:02.063 --> 00:07:04.367
change sign if L is odd.

88
00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:13.355
So for the next two,
few parts of this lecture,

89
00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:18.124
we're going to look at an application
to discussing the rotational

90
00:07:18.124 --> 00:07:21.260
motion of the molecule potassium.

91
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.630
This is one of the great targets for
Ultracold molecule research.

92
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.150
Here's a recent paper by one of
the leading troops in the field.

93
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.160
That's accessible through
science magazine or you can look

94
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.550
on Google Scholar and
find references to this work.

95
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.250
Basically there's a big milestone
in making very cold molecules which

96
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.470
are of interest to wide range
of scientific applications and

97
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.040
just technically fascinating and
challenging to work with.

98
00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.540
So the properties of
potassium-rubidium are well known.

99
00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.530
The reduced of this molecule
is given by this number.

100
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.170
The equilibrium radius is not that
well known at the moment, but

101
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:10.734
we'll take this common value of,
0.4 nanometers.

102
00:08:10.734 --> 00:08:15.540
And one important aspect

103
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.245
of this molecule is that it has
a permanent electrical dipole.

104
00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:22.085
For a moment in it's body frame.

105
00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:23.995
Now what I mean by that is,

106
00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:29.405
if you just hold the molecule in one
place there's an imbalance of charge.

107
00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:32.775
There's more negative charge
around the potassium and

108
00:08:32.775 --> 00:08:37.455
more positive charge around the rubidium.

109
00:08:37.455 --> 00:08:42.150
And that means that this molecule acts

110
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:47.490
like an electric dipole when it's
exposed to an external field.

111
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.110
We'll discuss that momentarily.

112
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.170
But, when there's no electric field
present then the Hamiltonian Conlan that

113
00:08:55.170 --> 00:09:01.170
describes the rotational motion of this
molecule is just given by this L squared

114
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.750
over two mu r and e squared where
r is equilibrium bond length, and

115
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:12.090
I've converted that so that's L times L
plus one times h bar squared over two mu

116
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:18.970
re squared and I've converted that to
an energy In temperature equivalent

117
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.800
units just because it's convenient for
these cold molecule applications.

118
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:30.867
And so you can see that this equivalent
temperature which is basically half

119
00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:39.420
the distance between the l equals zero.

120
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:45.180
And the allele equal one rotational
state is equivalent to 55 milicalvin.

121
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.180
Very low temperature.

122
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.010
Much cooler than heat for example.

123
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:58.530
Now we use the dimoment for the molecule
As a convenient reference through axis so

124
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:03.110
we're going to describe the orientation
of the molecule with respect to some

125
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:08.430
arbitrarily chosen laboratory
frame the x 3 x laboratory frame.

126
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.760
In terms of the angle what
it returns we In terms of

127
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.840
the given Cartesian frame, we describe
the orientation of the molecule by

128
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.900
the angle that its dipole moment makes
with respect to the various axes.

129
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.584
Now, in the ground state of the molecule,

130
00:10:28.584 --> 00:10:34.190
it's the The lowest spherical
harmonic is just a constant,

131
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.300
that's something you
should always remember.

132
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.190
The first,
l equal one is just either xy or x1, x2 or

133
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.310
x3 or some other combination of them.

134
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:50.320
And this means that the dipole moment
is oriented randomly in space,

135
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.940
so there is no net dipole.

136
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.020
Moment of the molecule when we
go to make a measurement of it,

137
00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:00.180
it could be in any arbitrary direction.

138
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.790
So we're now going to address
the question of how we orient and control
