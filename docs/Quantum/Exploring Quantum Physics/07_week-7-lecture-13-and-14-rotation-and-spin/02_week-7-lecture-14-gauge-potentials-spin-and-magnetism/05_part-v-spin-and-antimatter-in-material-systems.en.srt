00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:03,330
Hello everyone,
welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,850
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,680
In this part, we're going to look at
some of the applications of spin and

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,310
antimatter both in fundamental science,
technology, and aspects of every day life.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,600
This part of the lecture is just going to
be an overview of how many of the things

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,820
that we discussed in the previous parts
come together in practical applications.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,840
So, we introduced the Pauli matrices
previously and it turns out,

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,590
these constitute most widely
use representation of spins.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,350
So, in other words, for

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,690
spin one-half particle, the spin
operator can be written in this way.

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,320
This amounts, you might say to
a specific choice of the alpha and

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,840
beta that are in draft papers.

13
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,450
And, indeed, the alphas and

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:57,130
betas in the three-dimensional system
are constructed using these poly matrices.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,850
And now, with this necessarily
two-dimensional representation,

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,000
we basically have a two by two bases
that describes the spin states.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,390
And so in this bases,

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,000
we identify this bases vector as
a spin up and this is spin down.

19
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,270
And indeed when we turn
on magnetic fields for

20
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,900
example we can see that with
choice of the poly matrix.

21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,200
>> This convention for
the electrons make sense.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,066
In fact, the direction of the angular
momentum of the electron is up and

23
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:37,620
this one is down.

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,934
By up and down we mean the projection
of s upon the third axis is either

25
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:47,704
plus one half or minus one half
Plus h-bar to a minus h-bar.

26
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:55,603
So the important spin one-half
particles are the electron, and

27
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:58,210
various other massive particles.

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,820
And the neutrino.

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,170
These are all fermions.

30
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,340
And so according to
Wolfgang Pauli they obey something

31
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,960
called the Exclusion Principle, meaning
that total wavefunction has to change sign

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,260
under exchange of any
two identical fermions.

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,400
So the total wavefunction
includes both space and

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,100
spin parts So, it is

35
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,850
useful to distinguish the symmetric and

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,400
anti symmetric combinations of
electron spin wave function.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,270
So, here for example, we have a,
let say we have two electrons.

38
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,900
So, since their angular momentum are h bar
over 2 The sum of the two zero and one.

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,980
for the state zero, here's the linear
combination of two electron

40
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,880
spin functions that gives a net of zero.

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:03,353
And then there's the states that have one.

42
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:07,801
Here are the functions.

43
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:10,440
And so this one's called a singlet,
because there's only one,

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,310
this is called a triplet
because there's three.

45
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,980
And this structure is
found in a pervasive way.

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,580
For example, let's just have a look
at a topic of recent interest,

47
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,280
has been the world's most accurate clock.

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,300
I think that's changed slightly,
still among the world's most accurate,

49
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,730
there's aluminum iron logic enabled
atomic clock developed by David.

50
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,390
And so here are the various energy levels
that are involved in the operation of

51
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,080
this clock.

52
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,630
And the group in blue are spin triplets.

53
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,240
That you might identify the spin triplets.

54
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Then, this one is a spin singlet.

55
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,790
Then, when you turn on magnetic fields
you have possible nuclear spins that

56
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:09,440
can affect the overall angular momentum,
but by and large this classification

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,730
of overall total spin is very useful
in the design operation of atomic logs.

58
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,398
Magnetism feral magnetism or
the existence of permanent

59
00:04:23,398 --> 00:04:28,620
magnets typically associated with elements
that have many spin parallel electrons.

60
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,250
So let's say iron has
six electrons in the so

61
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,130
called 3d orbital, and so
that enables them to largely line up

62
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,429
so in the ground state of iron
you have net magnetic moment.

63
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,080
Of two bohr magnetons.

64
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,660
So iron is of course a very
commonly used magnetic material.

65
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,890
Neodymium is the basis of
the ultra-hard magnets, one of which is

66
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,279
shown in the magnetic levitation demo that
you can see in the additional materials.

67
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,520
Again that's based on the fact that it
has an F shell that can hold up to 14

68
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,370
electrons so you get a,
the ground state in Neodymium

69
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,310
has four parallel spins creating
a large permanent magnetic moment.

70
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,360
Most magnetic atom in the periodic table.

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,600
Is gadolinium which has eight
electron spins lined up.

72
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,190
So, the foundations of magnetism
are based on electron spins.

73
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,910
There's an emerging technology, well
it's really an emerging science still,

74
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,240
it has yet to yield.

75
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,690
A wide range of practical devices,
but the read heads on modern

76
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,070
magnetic storage media, are due to a
phenomenon called Giant Magnetoresistance,

77
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:01,900
which involves the control of electrical
current by magnetic techniques.

78
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,510
So it makes it possible for
a very high density magnetic storage,

79
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:14,210
and spin tronics refers to the search for
an alternative

80
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:19,080
to electron charge as a carrier of
current in solids there's a nice

81
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,958
recent review of the spin tronics by and
Stewart Parkin who are the leaders.

82
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,675
Expiremental leaders.

83
00:06:26,675 --> 00:06:29,460
And the foundational device for

84
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,050
this spintronics is something
called the transistor.

85
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:41,360
Hypothesized 24 years ago and still
a subject to that active to something.

86
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,190
It seems to be Hard to implement for
various reasons but

87
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:52,390
there's very active research on the use
of spin as a replacement for charge.

88
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,386
Antimatter again is something
that no one knew about.

89
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:05,660
Or really even imagined
prior to the Dirac equation,

90
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,570
and it is a somewhat exotic sort
of matter, but it is widely used,

91
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,610
positron emission tomography is
a medial diagnostic procedure,

92
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,000
a several million positron emission

93
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,930
tomographs are taken of medical patients
in the United States every year.

94
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,650
Positrons are often used in
sync with pron light sources,

95
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,030
because they have a longer lifetime
in electronic storage ring.

96
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,230
There are various types
of analytical techniques,

97
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,920
for example, for finding voids and
defects in materials.

98
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,700
As various types of positronium
spectroscopy that have been developed.

99
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,520
So these seemingly arcane and
minor features

100
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,880
that are found really only in the Dirac
equation or first revealed there.

101
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,470
A turn out to have a significant
impact even in daily life.

102
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,680
So that concludes this lecture
hope to see you again.
