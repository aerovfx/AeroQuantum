00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,630
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,910
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,700
I'm Charles Clark, and

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,210
in this part we're going to begin
a study of the Dirac Equation,

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,030
which is the foundational equation of
relativistic quantum mechanics for

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,980
description of the electron and
other spin one-half particles.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,060
So now we're going to begin,
Introduction to the Dirac equation.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,610
It's an amazing equation with
unbelievable consequences, and

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,510
it's really sort of the first
step down the road towards

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,640
relativistic quantum mechanics which
is a deep subject in its own right.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,470
And it is rather advanced for
a survey course of this type.

12
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,500
And so, our treatment is going to be
specific but not very comprehensive.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,790
We're going to look at the original
work of Dirac, who early on,

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,782
just a few years after the Schrodinger
equation was discovered decided that

15
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:03,994
he would investigate the extension
of quantum mechanical ideas

16
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:07,673
to make them consistent with
the theory of relativity.

17
00:01:07,673 --> 00:01:11,716
The Schrodinger equation you see is
a non-relativistic equation based on

18
00:01:11,716 --> 00:01:15,899
a non-relativistic description of
mechanics due to classical mechanics.

19
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:21,471
So Dirac undertook to understand
the nature of the wave equation for

20
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:24,610
the electron in a relativistic form.

21
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:29,933
So we're going to discuss
just the equation for

22
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:34,100
a free particle in one dimension
to keep things simple.

23
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,270
So here's the Schrodinger equation for
free particle in one dimension.

24
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,513
And it's easy to find
the solutions I mean,

25
00:01:44,513 --> 00:01:51,750
basically the solutions are e to
the i p dot r divided by h bar.

26
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,070
And then an e to the minus i omega t.

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,440
With e is equal to h bar omega.

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,270
So, Dirac saw to find
a relativistic version

29
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,040
of this equation, which would have
the following very important feature.

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,300
It would be homogeneous in time and
spatial variables.

31
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,430
You see the non relativistic
equation is first order in time and

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,650
second order in spatial derivative and
because of the Lorentz transformation,

33
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,120
a fully invariant equation would
have to be linear in space and time.

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,770
And also there's a reason why you
want there to be an evolution

35
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:42,010
equation of this form, that is, you want
to preserve the idea of a wave function.

36
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,210
And you want to understand how
a wave function evolves in time.

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,970
So the only ingredients at your
disposal are the momentum,

38
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:01,190
which of course is the p is
equal to h bar over i d dx.

39
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:03,620
So that has the right
relativistic invariance.

40
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,900
And then there's a requirement,

41
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,410
this is the relativistic dispersion
relation, which describes

42
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:18,060
the relationship between the energy, and
the momentum and the mass of a particle.

43
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,790
So you want your equation of motion

44
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,370
to satisfy this relativistic
dispersion relation.

45
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,650
So, possibly there should
be another term here,

46
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,040
which would then if you look at this and
think about you'll see that this does.

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,934
This does satisfy
the conditions of relativity,

48
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:45,522
provided that alpha squared and
beta squared are both equal to 1 and

49
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:50,856
that they satisfy this
anti-commutation relation.

50
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,180
Can you see why that is?

51
00:03:55,757 --> 00:04:03,340
Okay so, you can see that alpha and
beta can't just be pure numbers.

52
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,390
In fact, neither one of them can
be an ordinary number because

53
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,990
the anti-commutation relation
has to be satisfied.

54
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:15,680
But, in quantum mechanics we're quite
used to using linear operators and

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,230
so for
example here are choices of alpha and

56
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,900
beta, you can choose sigma one of
the alpha and sigma 3 of the beta.

57
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,940
These are the so called Pauli matrices and

58
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,810
this has a very straightforward
geometric interpretation.

59
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,810
So, you're familiar with
non-commuting operations.

60
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,890
This one in a two-dimensional system
reflects the vector about the 45 degree

61
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,880
line and
sigma 3 here inverts the coordinates.

62
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,122
So here's how the sigma 1 acts,
here's how sigma 3 acts.

63
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,011
So you can see that the operation sigma 3,

64
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:58,208
sigma 1 leaves this where
sigma one sigma 3 gives that.

65
00:04:58,208 --> 00:05:03,988
So, that gives us an example of the fact
that these mysterious documenting

66
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:10,150
quantities can at least be mapped onto
familiar geometrical representation.

67
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,071
So, in fact much of what we do now
is not going to depend on choosing

68
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:23,420
a specific representation for
alpha and beta.

69
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,940
First of all there are many,
many choices that give the same result and

70
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,730
isn't unique, sort of like the gauge and
variance problem.

71
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,270
What's important is that they
satisfy the commutation relations.

72
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,500
But if you choose two by two
matrices that's easy to solve,

73
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:45,230
the stationary equation, Dirac equation,
it's just proportional to a plane wave

74
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:53,370
and the remarkable thing is that, you
get both positive and negative energies.

75
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,595
Now you never get negative energies
in the solution for free particle in

76
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:04,570
non-relativistic mechanics because that
would require an imaginary momentum and

77
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,190
it would give rise to a non
normalizable wave function.

78
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,440
But as you're going to
find in the homework,

79
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,510
if you have a solution of the Dirac
equation, that's a positive energy.

80
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,620
Then you can find from it, another
solution that has a negative energy.

81
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,560
And it has the same
desirable characteristics

82
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,930
of the positive energy solution.

83
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,900
So there's nothing in the mathematics that
says you can exclude the negative energy

84
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,456
solutions, like there is in
the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation.

85
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:39,007
And these indicate the existence
of anti-matter, that is,

86
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:45,222
these negative energy solutions have been
found to be associated with the existence

87
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:50,315
of anti-particles that are apparently
present for all particles.

88
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:58,580
Okay, so now another consequence of
the Dirac Equation, very significant one,

89
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,712
was actually found in the two-dimensional
or three-dimensional versions both but

90
00:07:03,712 --> 00:07:08,010
we'll go directly to the three
dimensional equation.

91
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,940
So now you see this is
a straightforward generalization

92
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,270
of the one-dimensional Dirac equation.

93
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:21,800
It has a contribution from each of the
three spatial coordinates, and when you

94
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:28,300
go and require that this relativistic
dispersion relation be satisfied,

95
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,190
you find that there's a class
of anti-commutation relations.

96
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:37,976
So the alphas have to anti-commute among
themselves in the way indicated here.

97
00:07:37,976 --> 00:07:43,527
The alpha have to anti-commute with beta,
and then beta square is equal to one.

98
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:48,961
Now, this part seems fine, but

99
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:53,730
what about the conservation
of angular momentum?

100
00:07:53,730 --> 00:08:00,175
That's one of these things that you
would surely wish to see conserved,

101
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:04,517
but it doesn't commute
with this Hamiltonian.

102
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:09,485
I think that's quite easy to see
because this has the form of a vector.
