Hello everyone, welcome back to Exploring
Quantum Physics, I'm Charles Clark.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.870
In this lecture, we're just going to, go
through and explore some very

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.260
practical tools, for understanding and
using angular

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.310
momentum, to tailor to your own
applications.

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.690
At least when you look with simple
problems.

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.470
And I think these techniques will be
useful to you, in a

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.800
variety of other areas of angular

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.409
work solving problems in physics and
engineering.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.520
simulation, even video game composition.

10
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.991
So, in previous discussion we found that
any purely, [SOUND]

11
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:44.930
radial function, has zero angular
momentum, almost by, it's by definition.

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.210
There's no variation.

13
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.730
An angle and that for example is
demonstrated by

14
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.990
by this, this [INAUDIBLE]
So, lets look at the some familiar

15
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.010
things to find functions that have
definite and nontrivial angular Momentum.

16
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.540
And we understand the spherical system,
pretty clearly by now.

17
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.680
Okay, so how about the, the three
Cartesian coordinates?

18
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.180
Well,

19
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.930
we've, gone, you've gone through these,
type of calculations before.

20
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.210
Here is the, operation [INAUDIBLE]
operator.

21
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.810
On one of the Cartesian coordinates
returns the other Cartesian coordinates.

22
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.360
So this, this indicates that, when an
angular momentum operates

23
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.710
on a cartesian coordiante, it It works
within a close set.

24
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.580
Whatever it does, it brings back, a linear
combination of others.

25
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:52.324
And so this is consistent with what you
can show that the the Cartesian

26
00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:58.400
coordinates are members that have a
definite momentum of l.

27
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.300
Equal to one, meaning in quantum mechanics
that value that is in them.

28
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.910
Associated with the motion of, motion
that's

29
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.970
combined to a single set of Cartesian

30
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.820
coordinates, is Associated with an angular
momentum

31
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.325
of h bar, we'd use Planck's constant.

32
00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:20.640
[SOUND].

33
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.410
So, we've found ourselves, some handy
eigenfunctions of angular momentum

34
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.760
with [INAUDIBLE]
the one.

35
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.670
And now, here's what you might call
practical use if

36
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.740
you just, you just multiply those
coordinates by a spherical galsin.

37
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.030
You get, you get a convenient set of
molecular orbitals.

38
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.210
These are often used by chemists in
describing bonding, because

39
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.750
they are, they're orbitals that are direct
along a particular axis.

40
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.198
Here's the.

41
00:02:57.198 --> 00:03:03.420
p1 or px the p2 or p y, p3 or p z.

42
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.710
So these are, these are again things that

43
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.530
have very simple, properties with respect
to angular momentum.

44
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.970
But they can be oriented in space no more
less arbitrary fashion.

45
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.830
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.320
So here is a, fairly straightforward light
hearted quiz for you to

47
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.420
investigate some of the other properties
associated with this type of flexibility.

48
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.020
You know, what other things are,
determined by the positioning

49
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.880
of states of angular momentum where you
want them to be.

50
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.190
Okay, so these Cartesian coordinates are
in some sense, you might say chemists.

51
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.986
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:48.986 --> 00:03:53.700
Choice of [INAUDIBLE]
of eigenfunctions.

53
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.850
They're well, they're well suited to
describing structural relationships.

54
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.030
If you have a carbon ring you might, you

55
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.810
might use Orbitals that are lying along
molecular bonds.

56
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.510
But here's another one.

57
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.380
It's, in some sense a very

58
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.720
straight forward, linear combination of
those three.

59
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.810
It just involves X1 and X2, and X3.

60
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.910
So here are, here are three independent,
choices.

61
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.210
But these have, a definite,

62
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.940
projection, of, of the.

63
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.660
Third L3 the conventional z component of
the angular momentum.

64
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.400
1, 0, and minus 1.

65
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.870
And they satisfy

66
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:45.960
this relationship.

67
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.316
[BLANK_AUDIO]

68
00:04:51.316 --> 00:04:56.963
Which we, the raising and lowering op,
[UNKNOWN]

69
00:04:56.963 --> 00:05:02.770
raising and lowering operators When they
act upon one of these they change

70
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.380
its its magnetic quantum number and 5 plus
or minus 1.

71
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:16.470
And useful feature of these is that let's
say let's take the 1, 1 which is the

72
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:27.960
The, the eigenfunction with, m equal, plus
1, L equal 1, and m equal plus 1.

73
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:36.800
And if we just take if we raise it to an
arbitrary power, We get a

74
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.890
a state with a, with that raising the lth
power, we get

75
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.510
L units of angular momentum along the, the
lth re-axis.

76
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.830
And it turns out that that, that is also

77
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.790
a, an Eigen function of angular momentum
with value L.

78
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.470
So by, by taking, taking successive powers
of, of this,

79
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.590
of either this, this, function or the.

80
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.256
The minus 1, we can go to extremal,

81
00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:28.300
[SOUND]
value of m.

82
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:38.169
And then, that becomes the, the largest m,
[SOUND].

83
00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.950
For a given L.

84
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.850
And one can then use the lowering
operator, for example, to step down and

85
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.220
systematically generate all the,
eigenfunctions of any

86
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.770
given minimum with that particular Value
of L.

87
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.900
[SOUND] Yes here's that constructive
procedure I was just mentioning.

88
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.700
You define these primitives.

89
00:07:05.092 --> 00:07:10.940
You use those with ah,angular momentum of
plus 1 Minus 1.

90
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.460
And then, for example just

91
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:24.760
take the, the L full product of the plus 1
to get the LL state and then use L minus.

92
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.880
Operating on that, in order to, to step
down, and then just,

93
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:37.960
repeat as necessary to exhaust, all the,
states of spectrum.

94
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:43.204
And perhaps, perhaps you can see that,
when

95
00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:48.330
you do this, you're basically creating.

96
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.049
A large polynomial in the, in the three

97
00:07:53.049 --> 00:07:58.340
variables, x1, x2, x3, and then your

98
00:07:59.484 --> 00:08:04.203
the minus operator, l minus is equal to

99
00:08:04.203 --> 00:08:09.208
Lx minus iLy you know, so Lx Lx or L1 I

100
00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:14.650
should say is equal to x2p3 minus x3p2.

101
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.340
What that does is, it keeps the order of a
polynomial the same,

102
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.770
but it just dis, it redistributes

103
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.200
the powers, between the several Cartesian
coordinates.

104
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.520
So, this is, this is an, you know.

105
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.150
Is a little indication, that, when you,
when

106
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.140
you operate in the lowering, the lowering
operator.

107
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.235
You're not changing the, degree of the
polynomial structure.

108
00:08:35.235 --> 00:08:43.460
[SOUND]
Well, finally, if you.

109
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.010
Do a Google search on the phrase spherical
harmonics.

110
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:53.690
You'll see that they are used in, remain,
remarkable, variety of applications.

111
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.010
For example in,

112
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:02.920
processing and synthesis of images, and
understand,

113
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.500
trying to give greater realism, in the
apparent properties of reflected light.

114
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.850
it, it turns out that the spherical
harmonic's

115
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:16.810
an incredibly efficient way, of
representing and encoding information.

116
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:22.454
They're sort of like the 48 transform, on
the surface of a sphere, and in many

117
00:09:22.454 --> 00:09:28.340
cases as we've seen in some of these
quantum mechanics Problems.

118
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.340
They, they encode, information about an
orbit that extends

119
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.640
throughout all of space, in a very
efficient way.
