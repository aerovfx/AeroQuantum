Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.040
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.040
In this part we're going to look at how

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.350
the concept of spin emerges very
naturally from the Dirac Equation.

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.400
It's quite a remarkable thing because so

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.520
little goes into the formulation of
Dirac Theory, so much comes out of it.

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.920
Including this amazing result of
the prediction of half interval spin

8
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.100
of fundamental particles.

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.050
On the exit quiz of the last part of this
lecture, previous part of this lecture,

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.480
you found that the angular
momentum operator did

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.470
not commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian.

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.410
So in particular, here we are with
three dimensional Dirac Equation,

13
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.800
with the various
anticommutations indicated.

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.380
And when you just apply this to the,
apply the commutator to the angular

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.130
momentum with the Hamiltonian,
It's straight forward to show this.

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.860
Because you see the momenta, pi,
are the elements of a vector.

17
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.140
So the angular momentum rotates a spatial
vector around, and so it mixes up,

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.149
the weighting of the momenta by
the different quantities alpha.

19
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.210
This seems problematic, but it turns
out to be a feature rather than a bug.

20
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.088
Let's see why.

21
00:01:28.558 --> 00:01:33.230
So, we have to ask, what's gone
wrong with the angular momentum?

22
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.400
Is there something else that
exists in the Dirac Equation that

23
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.280
can be used to sort of fix the problem
with the violation of angular momentum?

24
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.560
So let's see if we can identify
any other constants of motion

25
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.610
that derive from these
various relationships.

26
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.699
And I emphasize here that
everything we're doing now

27
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.680
is independent of the representation that
we take for the alphas and the betas.

28
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.960
So, as you'll see in a moment, if you sit
down and actually try this, you quickly

29
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.350
find something out and that is,
first of all, in the Dirac Equation, we're

30
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.340
only given anticommutation relationships
between involving these alphas and betas.

31
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.430
But it turns out that when you construct
quadratic forms of the alpha and beta

32
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.030
that you can get commutation
relations out of those.

33
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.560
So here I'm sort of anticipating
the result by this particular definition.

34
00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.610
But we're just going to use the cross
product of alpha with itself

35
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.390
times h bar over 4i to
define this new object.

36
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.716
Soit's defined entirely in terms
of these anticommuting numbers of

37
00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:55.874
Dirac Equation and let's see what type
of commutation relationships it yields.

38
00:02:59.474 --> 00:03:02.323
Okay, so,
let's just look at things one at a time.

39
00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:03.400
So, here's s1.

40
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.270
It's given by the cross
product of alpha with itself.

41
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.936
It's the one complement
of a cross product,

42
00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:16.050
which through the anticommutation
relationship simplifies to this.

43
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.940
Now we don't know what
the product alpha 2,

44
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.070
alpha 3 is because we don't have
a definite value of alpha 2, alpha.

45
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.860
That's going to depend
upon the representation.

46
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.010
But just bear with me.

47
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.808
It turns out that,
let's try to look at the commutator

48
00:03:31.808 --> 00:03:36.735
of s1 with the Hamiltonian
sort of bit by bit.

49
00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:42.250
So the first thing I'll, that's looked
at is the commutate of s1 with beta.

50
00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:47.870
Okay, so
here's the principle I mentioned earlier.

51
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.270
Here, this is how you write
the commutator down, in the usual way.

52
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.440
But now you can use
the anticommutation relationship

53
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.690
to pass beta to invert
the order of beta and

54
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.480
alpha 3 and
you pick up a minus sign when you do that.

55
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.730
And so do you see you just do that again.

56
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.036
You get rid of the minus sign.

57
00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:17.460
And so, s1 commutes with beta.

58
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.216
And it's automatically, too,
that s2 and s3 do as well.

59
00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:21.900
You can verify those if you like.

60
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.180
But it's a very similar reason.

61
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.000
So that makes it some
kind of candidate for

62
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.250
further investigation because at least it
commutes with part of the Hamiltonian.

63
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.760
Now let's see what it does for
other elements.

64
00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:46.369
Okay, so, sticking with this value for
the, this, well, it'll turn out

65
00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:50.990
to be the spin operator, let's look
at the commutator of s1 with alpha 1.

66
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.550
Okay, so now, once again,
very straightforward,

67
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.840
just the algebraic writing out a1,
alpha 1 minus alpha 1, s1.

68
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.410
And then invoking the anticommutation
relationship to invert

69
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.040
the order with getting a negative sign.

70
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.310
And then doing it again,
we find that s1, alpha 1 vanishes.

71
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.620
So that's possibly a nice thing.

72
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.470
Let's go further.

73
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.045
And now we start to see
something interesting.

74
00:05:23.045 --> 00:05:26.927
So here's again s1,
straightforward development commutator.

75
00:05:29.587 --> 00:05:34.917
Inverting the order,
and so now we have s1,

76
00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:40.550
alpha 2 is proportional
to i h bar alpha three.

77
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.106
So if you think about your
epsilon a b c operations,

78
00:05:48.106 --> 00:05:52.160
then that's suggestive.

79
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.686
So let's go one step further.

80
00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:05.180
And, given the, given those previous
operations you might want to pause.

81
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.376
Scroll back and

82
00:06:06.376 --> 00:06:11.536
then work out the commutator of
the vector s with the Hamiltonian.

83
00:06:11.536 --> 00:06:17.966
So again the vector s is defined this
way and there's the Hamiltonian.

84
00:06:21.285 --> 00:06:28.790
And again, I recommend that you do
that and what you find is this.

85
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.713
So, do you see that the commutator of s,

86
00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:37.875
s doesn't commute with the Hamiltonian but

87
00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:44.978
it returns the opposite of what
the commutator of l does with Hamiltonian.

88
00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:56.545
Therefore the vector sum
of these two operations,

89
00:06:56.545 --> 00:07:01.538
the orbital angular momentum, which is,

90
00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:07.101
remember that l is equal to r cross p,
r cross p.

91
00:07:07.101 --> 00:07:12.174
The angular momentum contains
only the spacial coordinates,

92
00:07:12.174 --> 00:07:16.481
the coordinate and
the momentum of the electron, and

93
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:20.132
then s is proportional
to alpha cross alpha.

94
00:07:20.132 --> 00:07:25.123
So the ingredients of s are just these
magical anticommuting numbers that

95
00:07:25.123 --> 00:07:29.228
have nothing to do with the spatial,
the space coordinate or

96
00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:32.140
the momentum coordinate of the electron.

97
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.190
So it's as if it it's
something intrinsic and so

98
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:44.290
this new object which is the sum of two
vectors commutes with the Hamiltonian.

99
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:52.160
And you can also show that
the components of the spin

100
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.890
operator satisfy the components
of an angular momentum.

101
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:01.484
But it differs from the orbital momentum,
in that the intrinsic

102
00:08:01.484 --> 00:08:06.432
spin angular momentum has value of
half of reduced blocks constant.

103
00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:15.170
So all that came just from this
amazingly simple equation.

104
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:21.080
It yielded both spin, a property of
the electron that was postulated, but

105
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:26.990
couldn't really be associated with
any reasonable physical theory.

106
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.606
And then the existence of antimatter,
something that no one had ever thought of.

107
00:08:31.606 --> 00:08:34.424
And which had a revolutionary
influence on the world.

108
00:08:38.104 --> 00:08:44.162
So, just to wrap things up for now, the
other things, antimatter, electron spin,

109
00:08:44.162 --> 00:08:49.400
the Dirac Equation also gives this so
called anomalous magnetic moment.

110
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.410
It describes that correctly,

111
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:57.060
gives fine structure of atomic
spectra to very good accuracy.

112
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.190
And, then it has a bunch of other sort of,
paradoxes involved.

113
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.500
So for example, the Zitterbewegung,

114
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.480
discovered by Schrodinger, which
suggests that the free Dirac electron is

115
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.040
always oscillating violently
at the speed of light.

116
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.240
And that the classical
motion's just a drift motion.

117
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.550
Now this is a simplistic interpretation.

118
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.860
But, recently, there have been
counterparts to this relativistic

119
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.145
zitterbewegung encountered in
non-relativistic system, in fact,

120
00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:29.980
in cold trapped atoms and such things
as topological insulators have been

121
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:35.080
found to have Dirac-like dispersion points
in their electronic band structure.

122
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.510
So there's the richness
of the Dirac Equation

123
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.620
extends well beyond its application
to relativistic particles.
