00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.730
Hello everyone, welcome back to Exploring
Quantum Physics, I'm Charles Clark.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.820
In this final part of the lecture, we're
going to look at,

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.190
the systematics of solving the
Schroedinger

4
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.510
equation for systems with angular
momentum.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.180
Now early on, we had some fun sort of just
making

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.940
functions up And seeing that they had
desirable properties.

7
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.000
now in this section we're going to look at
more systematic approaches, both

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.490
analytical, and numerical, that one would
use to develop in a rigorous way.

9
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.620
Or at least a systematically improvable
way.

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.080
A solution to a shortage equation.
So we learned that

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.080
when we have a spherical potential,
potential that's a function of the

12
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.460
radius only then one can choose

13
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.230
Eigenfunctions that are Eigenfunctions of
momentum, and then in fact the

14
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.850
the functions that encode angular momentum
and

15
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.710
the angles of the system are universal.

16
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.180
That is they have, they can always be, the
same

17
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.160
functions can always be applied, though
there's flexibility in choosing them,

18
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.000
that may be advantageous when you're
dealing with problems that have

19
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.360
a, a particular outcome in terms of
interaction with external fields.

20
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.170
So now just expanding if we take take

21
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.800
the view that the wave function will be an
eigenfunction of

22
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.900
angular momentum, then the Schrodinger
equation can be rendered in this form.

23
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.230
It's separable in radial and angular
variables.

24
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.950
And it's convenient it usually convenient
to go to some dimensionless

25
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.850
form, because then as we alluded to in
earlier lectures, you

26
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.890
have a good chance of being able to map
the equation

27
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.970
that you have, into some standard special
function of mathematical physics.

28
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.840
It's been very well studied.

29
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.800
those analytic properties are understood.

30
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.340
where there's a good understanding of this

31
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.450
asymptotic behavior, and things of that
type.

32
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.290
Things that you don't want to have to do
for yourself.

33
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.490
So this just, these, these are just, sort
of standard approaches to reducing

34
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.980
the wave function and the, and the
potentials in the N V energies

35
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.990
to some dimensionalist set of variables.
Now let's

36
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.280
have a little exercise in how that works
in practice.

37
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.860
Okay, so with that scaling accomplished we
have,

38
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.740
we attained a simplified form of equation
here.

39
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.050
And I guess it's, it's quite obvious that
near row equals zero.

40
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.410
this equation becomes problematic.
There, there's a singularity here.

41
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.430
And well, it doesn't exist for l equals
zero.

42
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.050
But it's there's something there's
another,

43
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.740
another term that's still present there.

44
00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.400
And so the the singular points

45
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.760
of equations of this type.
Are where psi

46
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.896
and d psi d rho

47
00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:44.898
cannot be specified

48
00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:49.474
independently.

49
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.680
This is, this is in contrast to the

50
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.910
usual case of a linear differential
equation, where you

51
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.496
always are able to choose the, the
function

52
00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:06.960
of the derivative without any necessary
constraint between them.

53
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.285
but that applies only if the underlying,
if the potential is non-singular.

54
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:16.280
So the angles operate itself introduces a
singularity in the potential.

55
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.450
Nevertheless, although one cannot specify
the

56
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.899
function of it's derivitive independently,
there still always exists two solutions.

57
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.780
for second order differential equations.

58
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.810
And near the singular point the following,
the following behavior is generic.

59
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.060
So this is, here's an, here's an example
from a it's from a two dimensional wave

60
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.820
equation for the Bessel function.
But it has, it, its properties are similar

61
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.740
to those in three or, more than two
dimensions.

62
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.430
And that is the sing, here's the singular
point, r equals 0.

63
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.038
And let's, so this J zero and Y zero are
two solutions for

64
00:05:07.038 --> 00:05:12.348
what you might call the r equals 0
solution, two

65
00:05:12.348 --> 00:05:14.140
dimensions.

66
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.810
And so you can see that one of them is
regular at the origin.

67
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.150
And then the other solution is has a, has

68
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.030
a lo-, in this case a logarithm of
divergence.

69
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.850
So I guess the the point to be made is
that if

70
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.980
you, if you have a wa-, a function that
satisfies this equation.

71
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.000
Equation, and you choo, you choose a
particular value,

72
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.520
you choose a particular value

73
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:43.620
away from the origin.

74
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.680
And then you, you assign a value of the
function and the slope,

75
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.370
a slope at that point.

76
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.440
Then there's a, there's a unique function.

77
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.130
That is of a unique solution that's
regular at the origin.

78
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.810
But the generic behavior is that you'll,
you'll

79
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.660
pick up a component of the divergence
solution.

80
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.580
this is just another case for.

81
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.370
The, these are the oscillating vessel
functions.

82
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.190
And these are the ones that have
exponential.

83
00:06:16.238 --> 00:06:21.530
divergence and convergence and you see the
same, the same properties

84
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.790
associated with the singular point.

85
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.060
In other words, at the singular point,
there's typically a unique solution of the

86
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.070
equation that is regular, and then there's

87
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.710
an infinite number of solutions that are
irregular.

88
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:40.670
Which you know, could just be arbitrary
linear combinations of JA, AJ not, plus B

89
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.356
Y not, is the generate solution but unless
B is equal to zero, it will diverge.

90
00:06:46.356 --> 00:06:53.676
Okay, so for Schrodinger equations in
three dimensions, provided the

91
00:06:53.676 --> 00:07:00.740
potential here.
Is provide U is weaker

92
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:13.830
than r to the minus two as r goes to zero.
these terms dominate, and so.

93
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.720
The behavior of the solutions near the
origin

94
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.520
is, is in the, the leading order behavior

95
00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.740
is independent of you, it's universal,
it's determined

96
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.030
by this very strong repulsive angular
momentum barrier.

97
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.320
And so

98
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:35.320
the two possible solutions in this case,
are of the form, so

99
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.490
phi of rho just goes to some constant as
rho goes to 0.

100
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.530
And the leading coefficient, the leading
term, is plus L for

101
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.970
the regular solution, or minus L plus 1
for the irregular solution.

102
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.220
Now, you never use the irregular solution
near the origin, but if you're,

103
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.740
you're piecing together different parts of
a problem as you move

104
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:04.010
away from the origin, you to another,
another type of effective potential.

105
00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.540
you, you'll net the, the irreg, the
solution that's

106
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:12.920
irregular at the origin becomes important
in describing physical processes.

107
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.430
For example, the scattering theory.

108
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.540
great use is made of the solution that's
irregular at the origin

109
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.590
which is employed in, in regions that are
far from the origin

110
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.060
and gives rise to the phase shift that
characterizes this scattering processes.

111
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.960
then there's also the issue of behavior of

112
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.830
large distances, and again there's a,
there's a similar,

113
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.590
fact at hand there.
Typically, especially

114
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.840
when the, the potential grows indefinitely
like for the harmonic

115
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.880
oscillator or the bouncing ball every, the
generic

116
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.430
solution diverges in that region, and
there's only a few special

117
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.560
cases that, that converge.
And are acceptable as physical solutions.

118
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.540
So here's a particular case of now that
I've mentioned

119
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.530
one I like a lot, I like this example a
lot.

120
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.270
The area function.

121
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:28.150
you've worked an example from this, and
again here you see there's a, basically,

122
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:33.800
at the turning point of the classical
motion, you know these, this pair, Ai and

123
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.690
Bi together, a linear

124
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:43.910
combination provides the most general
solution that's possible,

125
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.440
to the Schrodinger equation in, in the
linear potential.

126
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:54.900
but unless the coefficient of Bi vanishes,
you get a solution that diverges

127
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.830
in the, so called, forbidden region beyond
the turning point of classical motion.

128
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:04.030
Now we're going to solve the hydrogen atom
proper.

129
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.710
Outline the solution

130
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.350
as it's done in the ordinary way.

131
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:13.140
Which is to or the conventional way in
textbooks, which is to solve, directly

132
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:19.409
solve the Schrodinger equation in terms of
a, analytical approach.

133
00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.310
and this is important for a variety of
reasons.

134
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.800
First it's a good example that has a

135
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.760
lot of, counterparts of treating the
harmonic oscillator.

136
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.840
Are, or variations

137
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.670
on it in systems where you don't have a
high degree

138
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.060
of symmetry that the hydrogen atom has,
and it shows you how

139
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:42.280
you incorporate the knowledge of the
singularity the singular points of

140
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.440
the of the equation motion at the origin,
and at large distances.

141
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.416
And then, in practical matters for certain
types of calculations where you want to.

142
00:10:52.416 --> 00:10:56.196
ca-, calculate collisions,
photoionization, cross-section,

143
00:10:56.196 --> 00:10:56.980
and the like.

144
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.760
by the far the most convenient way of
doing that.

145
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.300
In some cases, the only practical way I

146
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:07.570
think, is to have access to the wave
functions.

147
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:10.490
So that you can take the appropriate
matrix elements.

148
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.320
Right.

149
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.200
In any event here is The hydrogen atom in

150
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.670
simple form, potential is inversely
proportional to the radius.

151
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.450
we use scale

152
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:28.000
variables, and we get a, a reduced
dimensionless equation of this form.

153
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.390
Now in the hydrogen atom, like in the
solar system, as, as we look, discussed in

154
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:40.440
the early lectures on the Bohr model,
there

155
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.490
are two domains, energy positive and
energy negative.

156
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.600
For positive energies, the electron
escapes

157
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.540
from the nucleus, moves indefinitely far
away.

158
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:51.890
For negative energies, it's bound.

159
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.950
So let's we're going to deal with the
bound states in this treatment.

160
00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.330
In that case, the energies are negative
and

161
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:06.970
so in the, in this equation.
it is evident,

162
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:12.150
I think, that, as as rho goes to infinity,

163
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:20.380
then, then this term becomes negligible to
that, as, as, as do the

164
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:26.160
others.
The the rho, the dependence upon rho

165
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.550
terms that depend upon rho can be
neglected.

166
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.940
And so that, that means that sorry, the

167
00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.690
second, the second derivative is still
still effectual.

168
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.470
it means that large rho, there's a,
there's a exponentially decaying envelope.

169
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:58.130
And when you take that into account, quite
remarkably.

170
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.230
let, let's see how this works now.

171
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.200
you get you by this substitution, you get
this formula.

172
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:12.080
Then, quite remarkably, this this is
really in some sense a

173
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.880
if you think about the powers of, of,
Taylor series.

174
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.910
This has a one over row, this is a
constant, this is

175
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.170
a one over row squared, and that's a one
over row squared.

176
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:23.670
So we have a

177
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.440
row to the minus two, row to the minus
one.

178
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.350
And row to the zero, type of coefficients
in this equation.

179
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.590
But in this form, we now just have a row
to the minus two.

180
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:45.030
From these two, and then a row to the
minus one from these two.

181
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.040
So this means that we if we, if we use a
power series,

182
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:56.840
This type of transformation leads us to a
two-term recurrence relation.

183
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.690
Which is solvable.

184
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:03.520
Because if you have a two-term recurrence
relation you can just, you can just start

185
00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.720
at the singular part of the origin and
then, choose

186
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.880
an arbitrary value and just advance the
wave function indefinitely.

187
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:16.230
You don't if you have a three term
recurrence relation, it's, you have to

188
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:26.290
satisfy a, what amounts to a non-trivial
boundary condition.

189
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.620
Furthermore, in the hydrogen atom, as well
in the harmonic oscillator,

190
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.490
and a number of other cases where you have
highly

191
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:42.670
sort of bound states.
The

192
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:48.580
the series has to terminate at some, at
some value of the

193
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.130
order in the series.

194
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.100
If it continues on indefinitely, it'll
tend to diverge.

195
00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.960
So this again is sort of a generic case
that you find that from the, the two term.

196
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.220
Relation.

197
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.090
It implies vanishing

198
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:20.107
of higher members at Eigen

199
00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:26.980
values.
And those are, those are relatively easy

200
00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:35.010
to see.

201
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.460
Now you see the same, the same sort of
behavior

202
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.140
in numerical work and

203
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.530
I've, I've written composed a spreadsheet
that allows you to see

204
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.390
numerical integration of the shortage
equation sort of before your eyes.

205
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.100
And there's a small instruction manual.

206
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.760
It's fairly easy to use, and I think the.

207
00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.870
If you are, if you're interested in
practical solution of

208
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:06.180
the SchrÃ¶dinger Equation for arbitrary
potentials, getting some experience with

209
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:10.110
numerical techniques is invaluable,
because it shows you that the,

210
00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:16.030
that the the, the generic existence of
this divergent behavior.

211
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.090
When you're trying to, when you're trying
to

212
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:23.825
find a solution that, that converges at
large distance.

213
00:16:23.825 --> 00:16:26.690
Cause in, in numerical work, if you

214
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:32.470
continue onwards, eventually you'll see a
divergence.

215
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.500
So there's a a bit of an art associated
with numerical

216
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.330
work and finding solutions for which
there's no known analytic form.

217
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.630
So, I'm, I'm going to leave off with
lecturing.

218
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:50.870
I encourage you to To try your hand at
numerical integration.

219
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:57.470
And I think the the homework problem set
for this week, is a

220
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:02.400
little bit more challenging than usual.
hope you enjoy it anyway.

221
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.260
And like to see you back again in our last
week.
