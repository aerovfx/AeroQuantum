1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,820
In this lecture we're going to discuss
a very interesting quantum effect,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,100
namely, the phenomenon
of superconductivity.

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,850
Which is rather amazing field because
superconductors have a number of

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:18,500
remarkable properties such as,
for instance, so shown here,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,685
the phenomenon of levitation.

6
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:25,290
So here I'm showing a high
temperature superconductor,

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,435
wrapped up in a tissue to avoid heating,
levitating on top of a magnet.

8
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:34,551
And this phenomenon is actually unique
in this form to superconductor, and

9
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:37,913
is based on expulsion of magnetic
flux with Meissner effect.

10
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:42,761
So here I'm actually showing you
a movie of this same effect,

11
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:46,678
which was recorded by my
experiental colleague,

12
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:50,968
Johnpierre Paglione in
the Joint Quantum Institute,

13
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:55,288
here a superconductor moving
around on top of magnet.

14
00:00:55,288 --> 00:01:00,950
So this phenomenon of levitation is
indeed, well, quite remarkable and

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,940
it's oftentimes used to impress
visitors at various science shows.

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,931
But it's just one of many exciting
phenomena that appear in relation to

17
00:01:10,931 --> 00:01:16,266
superconductivity, and some of them
we're going to discuss later today.

18
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:19,680
But let me just mention
that superconductivity

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,736
is an extremely rich field.

20
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:24,436
So suffice it to say that it has so

21
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:29,836
far resulted in about ten Nobel Prizes
that have been awarded for

22
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:33,748
various discoveries in superconductivity.

23
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:34,769
And furthermore,

24
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:39,310
there are definitely a lot of major
mysteries that still remain in the field.

25
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,450
And obviously we cannot discuss everything
in one lecture, so I'm going to focus

26
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,666
towards the end of the lecture on a key
theoretical concept that sort of underlies

27
00:01:49,666 --> 00:01:55,135
the theory, so-called Bardeen Cooper
Schrieffer theory of superconductivity.

28
00:01:55,135 --> 00:02:01,508
And this is the phenomenon of Cooper
pairing, which is responsible,

29
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:06,510
to a large degree, for
the appearance of the.

30
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,090
But let me start with discussing
the main property of a superconductor,

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,330
namely, the state of zero resistance,
which is also

32
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,430
the reason why superconductors
are actually called superconductors.

33
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:27,130
And to do so, let me go back in time
a little more than 100 years ago,

34
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,290
to 1911, when this happy-looking guy,
Heike Kamerlingh Onnes,

35
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,830
was performing various low-temperature
experiments to liquefy helium.

36
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,330
And during these experiments he noticed
that the resistivity of mercury dropped

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,250
exactly to zero below a certain
critical temperature of 4.2 K.

38
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,120
So this was very surprising, and
actually it is very surprising.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,890
It also should surprise you,
in particular,

40
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,660
if you recall what we discussed
in the fourth lecture,

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:06,264
in the last lecture last week, where we
talked about the resistivity of metals.

42
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:09,685
And so
I mentioned that in all real materials,

43
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:15,085
there always are imperfections that
give rise to disorder that in turn

44
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:18,005
give rise to scattering and
finite resistance.

45
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:22,295
So what you would expect in a normal
metal would be that the resistance, well,

46
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:26,455
it can go down, but you would want it to
saturate to a certain finite value because

47
00:03:26,455 --> 00:03:27,951
there is no localization.

48
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:31,868
If there is localization it
will actually shoot up and

49
00:03:31,868 --> 00:03:36,133
go to infinity while there is
no sort of a reasonable sort of

50
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,300
a priori reason why it would
drop down to exactly zero.

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,150
Not to a small value,
not to tiny value, to exactly zero.

52
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,408
And this is what
Kamerlingh Onnes observed, and

53
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:50,278
this was the birth of superconductivity.

54
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:53,160
It was the first time people
saw superconductivity, and

55
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,307
it was truly amazing.

56
00:03:54,307 --> 00:03:58,260
In fact, and
in particular because of that,

57
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,845
he was awarded the 1913
Nobel Prize in physics.

58
00:04:04,525 --> 00:04:09,505
Now another effect which we already
discussed in relation to this levitation

59
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:12,245
was magnetic flux expulsion.

60
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:16,625
This is probably a second
very interesting phenomenon.

61
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:22,250
And well, if you have a metal,
let's say if you heat up this

62
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,270
material up to room temperature, let's
say, and penetrate it with magnetic flux,

63
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,760
the flux will more or less just go
through the material above the critical

64
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:36,180
temperature and there will be no
significant distortion of the flux.

65
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,160
So it's sort of amazing phenomenon
that happens once you go

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,530
into the superconducting phase,

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,940
is that the magnetic field now
tries to avoid the superconductor.

68
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,830
So instead of going through it,
it goes around it.

69
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,100
And so you may say that it's
expelled from the superconductor and

70
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,870
this effect is called the Meissner effect.

71
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,080
So returning to this picture of a high
temperature superconductor levitating

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,280
on top of a magnet, what's actually going
on here is that the magnetic field lines

73
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,960
primarily go around this superconductor.

74
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,500
And you may see that this superconductor
is sort of sitting on this on this flux,

75
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,808
because it's energetically not
favorable for it to go down.

76
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,900
It would increase the energy
of the system, and

77
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,330
therefore it's supported by this flux.

78
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,520
Well, just a short comment here, though,

79
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,210
is that I'm a bit
oversimplifying this picture.

80
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,260
So as a matter of fact,
there is indeed the Meissner effect.

81
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,140
But apart from the Meissner effect,
there is also a little bit

82
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,490
of penetration of the superconductor
by a magnetic field.

83
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,610
But this penetration happens in
the form of so-called vortices

84
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:56,013
which are if you look at
the cross-section of the superconductor,

85
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:58,890
two dimensional cross-section.

86
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,760
Sorry, let me just plot it here, so
there will be this superconductor.

87
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,040
And most of this cross-section
is magnetic field free, but

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,130
there are certain regions which are very
narrow regions, very small regions,

89
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:20,240
where you do have a magnetic field sort
of penetrating through very thin lines.

90
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,550
And these lines are called vortices.

91
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,800
So in superconductors, these magnetic
field lines are called vortices.

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,202
And these vortices tend to appear in
the regions where superconductivity is

93
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:34,297
suppressed due to various
kinds of imperfections and

94
00:06:34,297 --> 00:06:36,310
disorders we already discussed.

95
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,180
And this in turn leads to the pinning
of this magnetic field line.

96
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,460
So as a matter of fact,
if you perform this experiment with a true

97
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,960
simple type 2 superconductor
which allows these flux lines,

98
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,710
you not only will be able to see that it
can be levitating on top of a magnet.

99
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,020
You can actually turn
it any way you see fit.

100
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,580
You can turn it at any angle and
it's still going to retain its position.

101
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,349
And this actually even more impressive
phenomenon is due to these flux lines and

102
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:06,478
this pinning.

103
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,908
But to discuss it further would
be a bit going too far, so

104
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:15,999
let me just stop here and
say that all in all so this magnetic field

105
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:21,018
expulsion is responsible for
this phenomenon of levitation.

106
00:07:21,018 --> 00:07:25,028
On a different note,
interestingly the Meissner effect,

107
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:30,640
this expulsion of the magnetic flux, on
the theoretical side is, to some degree,

108
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,880
equivalent to the Higgs mechanism that
occurs in elementary particle physics.

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,220
I'm sure many of you have heard about the
discovery of so-called the God particle or

110
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,490
Higgs particle last year, but

111
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,038
actually the mathematical theory of
this Higgs mechanism in a different

112
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,920
context of [INAUDIBLE] physics was put
together before Higgs by Phil Anderson.

113
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,710
And speaking, I would actually
call it Anderson-Higgs mechanism.

114
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,660
I'm not going to go into details of
why this expulsion of magnetic flux is

115
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,130
equivalent to Higgs, but

116
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,930
you may have heard that Higgs really is
important elementary particle physics,

117
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,120
because it gives rise to masses for
some elementary particles.

118
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,296
Here you may see that the Higgs
mechanism in this form gives rise to

119
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:20,078
mass of the magnetic field.

120
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,858
So it becomes energetically
unfavorable for

121
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:26,159
the magnetic field to be
inside the superconductor.

122
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:32,216
And well, this energy to be there is
sort of proportional to the so-called

123
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:38,200
superconducting water parameter that
appears below the critical temperature.

124
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,125
So I already advertised the fact
that superconductors caused

125
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,293
an amazing variety of
various new phenomena, and

126
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:52,438
the discoveries of these phenomena have
in turn led to at least ten Nobel Prizes.

127
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:55,204
And I list here these major discoveries,

128
00:08:55,204 --> 00:08:58,528
sort of these hallmark
discoveries in the field.

129
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:01,138
And the first one we talked about,

130
00:09:01,138 --> 00:09:06,820
this is Kamerlingh Onnes discovery
of the effect itself back in 1911.

131
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,522
Then John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and
Bob Schrieffer got a 1972 Nobel Prize for

132
00:09:12,522 --> 00:09:16,448
developing microscopic
theory of superconductivity.

133
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:22,502
In the 50s, Brian Josephson and
Ivar Giaever got the 1973 Nobel Prize for

134
00:09:22,502 --> 00:09:28,017
discovering very interesting
tunneling effects in superconductors,

135
00:09:28,017 --> 00:09:33,729
in particular quantum Josephson effect,
the Josephson effect.

136
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,860
We're not going to be talking about it,
but it's very interesting.

137
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,912
So these guys made a major
breakthrough in the field,

138
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:46,135
I'm going to mention it in the next slide,
by discovering a so-called

139
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:50,385
family of high temperature
superconductors.

140
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:55,262
And finally, just ten years ago,
Alexei Abrikosov and

141
00:09:55,262 --> 00:10:00,888
Vitaly Ginzburg, along with Tony Leggett,
got a Nobel Prize.

142
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:07,992
And in particular, these two gentlemen
have put together a theory of vortices,

143
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:13,648
topological excitations that
appear in these quantum fluids.

144
00:10:13,648 --> 00:10:16,906
And I'm also including
here a future Nobel Prize,

145
00:10:16,906 --> 00:10:21,300
which I almost guarantee it to be
awarded sometime in the future, for

146
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,170
a theory of these high temperature
superconductors that I just mentioned.

147
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,140
We don't really know yet
the nature of this.

148
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,680
We know they exist, we know a lot of their
properties, very unusual properties,

149
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,130
but what's really going
on there we don't know.

150
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,630
So maybe it's going to be you.

151
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,216
Who knows?

152
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:44,546
But you should hurry because I think the
new experiments are getting us closer and

153
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:51,550
closer to understanding the uncovering
the mystery of these high temperature.

154
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,360
In any case, what I want to emphasize
here on this slide is a very

155
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,340
large time gap between the discovery and
the corresponding prize for

156
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,260
the first superconductor and the
microscopic theory of superconductivity,

157
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,360
which was put together about 40,
50 years later.

158
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,520
And it's not for a lack of trying.

159
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,890
People had tried very hard and
couldn't succeed.

160
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,063
So it turned out to be very difficult
to explain the basic nature

161
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:21,568
of superconductors.

162
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:27,224
Even though it took a while for
the theorists to provide an explanation of

163
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:32,232
superconductivity, the experimental
work on this, in fact,

164
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:38,940
has never really stopped since 1911,
since the discovery by Kamerlingh Onnes.

165
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,358
And the motivation for these experiments
is really easy to understand.

166
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:44,400
So as I mentioned,

167
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,340
of course, superconductors are special in
that they have exactly zero resistance.

168
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,180
So they have no losses whatsoever, and

169
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,540
they are able to conduct
electricity with no heating.

170
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:02,020
So if we were able to have
a superconductor at room temperature,

171
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,800
such room temperature superconducting
wires would have been able to

172
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,259
transport electricity over
large distances with no losses.

173
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,480
This, of course, would have been great,

174
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,648
especially now in the view of
this looming energy crisis.

175
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:22,652
Of course, now we transport electricity
from where we produce it to where we use

176
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:25,790
it using, well, normal wires,
metallic wires.

177
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,830
And those involved resistance and heating.

178
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,717
And so this heat we just lose,
so this goes nowhere.

179
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:35,620
So to have a room temperature
superconductor would be really great.

180
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,035
But unfortunately at this stage,
we don't really know

181
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:43,186
whether such a material may exist,
whether it's possible at all.

182
00:12:43,186 --> 00:12:49,523
But there has been lot of progress growing
materials which have a much higher

183
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:56,666
transition temperatures than the first
4.2 Kelvin superconductor, back here.

184
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:59,410
So this is the discovery
of superconductors, and

185
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,380
this plot here is really a diagram.

186
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,250
So here is the year from the early
1900s up to almost now, and

187
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:13,680
the points here correspond to compounds
with various transition temperatures.

188
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,453
And so you see that for
the first 70 or so years,

189
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:21,958
the progress has been really slow.

190
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:26,006
But then in the 80s there is
a huge jump up to here and

191
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:30,238
this class of materials
are what I already mentioned,

192
00:13:30,238 --> 00:13:36,494
the high temperature superconductors,
so-called Cooper superconductors,

193
00:13:36,494 --> 00:13:41,740
which are getting somehow dangerously
close to room temperature.

194
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,668
But they are not there yet.

195
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:48,868
So they're close, but
we still have about 100 Kelvin to go.

196
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:54,071
Now and also, very recently, there was
a discovery of a new class of material,

197
00:13:54,071 --> 00:14:00,485
a so-called iron-based superconductor
that also looked promising.

198
00:14:00,485 --> 00:14:05,206
But so far, although this raised,
increased the transition temperatures in

199
00:14:05,206 --> 00:14:08,798
superconductors, hasn't
really involved much theory.

200
00:14:08,798 --> 00:14:13,713
It's mostly about experimental
magic of growing materials and

201
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:17,330
trying out different compounds.

202
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,890
To emphasize this fact,
in the last slide in this segment,

203
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,520
let me actually mention
a guy who was really,

204
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,400
really good at finding
new superconductors.

205
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,000
He was an experimentalist
working at Bell Labs.

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,280
His name was Bernd Matthias.

207
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,030
And he was a legend in this business.

208
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:46,620
And he, back in the 50s and 60s,
he came up with a set of rules to

209
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,350
help others discover new superconductors,
and here is his list of those rules.

210
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,160
I don't expect you to understand their
significance, actually they're not to

211
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,870
be taken too seriously because in these
high temperature superconductors,

212
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,050
most of those rules actually violate it.

213
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,650
But let me go over them.

214
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,396
So he said that high symmetry is good,
cubic symmetry is best.

215
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:09,724
You want to stay away from oxygen,
stay away from magnetism,

216
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,260
stay away from insulators.

217
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,230
By the way,
this is all we find in superconductors.

218
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:20,240
And the most important rule due to
Matthias was to stay away from theorists.

219
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,481
And this was really bad, we know,
but it was deserved because,

220
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:30,936
again, for many years there was
no theory of superconductivity.

221
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:35,303
But fortunately,
the situation has changed in

222
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:40,435
the 1950s when Leon Cooper and
then John Bardeen and

223
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:46,898
Bob Schrieffer came up with the very
clear explanation of the effect.

224
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:51,715
And in the remaining three segments we
are going to go over this explanation,

225
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:54,382
but in the next video
I'm going to mostly talk

226
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:58,181
about the preliminary material
we need to know to get there.
