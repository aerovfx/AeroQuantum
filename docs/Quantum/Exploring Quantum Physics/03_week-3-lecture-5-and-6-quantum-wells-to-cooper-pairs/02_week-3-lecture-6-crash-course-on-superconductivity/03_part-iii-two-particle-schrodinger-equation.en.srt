1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,210
In the end of the previous video,
I advertised to some degree,

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,640
the main result that we're going to
derive, namely that the electrons near

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,080
the firmer surface at low temperatures
are going to form this bounce states of

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,110
two electrons which are going to
condense and form this superconductor.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,080
And now we're entering the technical
part of the lecture where we actually

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,950
would want to get this calculation done
and to see how it actually happens,

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,350
and it connects somewhat to the
calculations we were doing in the previous

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,349
lecture where we were studying
particles in various potential.

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,630
So there we were dealing with a single
particle quantum mechanics so

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,350
it was an externally imposed potential
in which a single particle was moving

11
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,040
which was localize there.

12
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,340
Now, what we want to do, we want to
start actually two particle problem.

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,230
With two particles here
describing effectively

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:03,510
the two electrons near the Fermi surface
in the context of superconductivity.

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,610
And it turns out that actually
two particle problems often times

16
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,910
in quantum mechanics reduce
to single particle problems.

17
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:17,790
And in this segment, I'm going to
illustrate how exactly it happens.

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,948
So here we're interested in analyzing
this two-particle Schrodinger equation.

19
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:29,246
And to make things general, for
the sake of lectures later in the course,

20
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:34,630
I'm coursering here actually two
different particles with masses m1 and

21
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,842
m2, but in the next segment we'll
work with the two electron problem,

22
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:42,380
where m1 is actually equal to.

23
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,600
So, what we have here, is essentially
kinetic energy of two particles, so

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,272
this response to the P1 squared over

25
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:55,350
2 m1 kinetic energy the first particle,
plus P2 squared over 2m2,

26
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,660
kinetic energy of the second particle and
the interaction between them

27
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,800
which we expect to depend only on
the distance between the particles.

28
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,090
And now we have weight function and

29
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,890
that depends on both coordinates
of the particle r1 and r2 and

30
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,770
well the right hand side is
the usual energy times psi.

31
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,540
So we're going to solve this equation.

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,088
Now, the goal of this video is to show
that actually instead of solving this

33
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:29,978
complicated looking differential equation,

34
00:02:29,978 --> 00:02:34,376
it would depend on two vectors r1 and
r2, we can reduce it to the good old

35
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:39,500
single particle Schrodinger equations
you already know how to solve.

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,350
And to see how it happens, let's do
the following change of variables so

37
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,410
we will go from the coordinates r1 and
r2 to the actual coordinates of

38
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:56,470
each individual particles to
this capital R and lowercase r,

39
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,780
so the formula represents the center
of mass of our particles.

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,280
So it's defined as so, and the second one
is the distance between the particles.

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,468
So the relative distance
between particles r1 and r2.

42
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:13,338
Now what we're going to do,

43
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:19,036
we're going to rewrite this equation in
terms of this capital R and lettercase r.

44
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:23,275
So in order to do this, we,
well first we notice that of course

45
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:26,870
the potential energy depends
only on the distance.

46
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,730
Basically by construction,
we chosen this way.

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,840
And the only non-trivial part which we
have to analyze is this kinetic energy.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,738
Degree which this applies which
in here in this brackets.

49
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:42,850
So we're going to work
with these guys now.

50
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,050
So to calculate this part
of the kinetic energy,

51
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,818
we can focus for the sake of simplicity
on just one component of this Laplacian.

52
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:56,765
Laplacian is a sum of second
derivative with the respect

53
00:03:56,765 --> 00:04:01,750
to each of the directions in our
problem x- z, so let's just focus on x,

54
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,649
and in this case, the capital case
X is going to be the center of mass

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,420
X component and this is going to be
a relative coordinate in the x direction.

56
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,635
Now in order to change
the variables in the Laplacian,

57
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:22,582
we can go from the derivative of
this delta x1 to derivative with

58
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:26,590
a respect to a capital X and
a lower case X.

59
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,060
And this transformation can be done by
rewriting it as so, so we basically

60
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,990
adding some sense in the derivative of
m in the numerator and the nominator.

61
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:42,290
And so this derivative of d capital
X over x1 is calculated from here.

62
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,120
And this derivative of d lower case
x over x1 is calculated from here.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,340
And the first one is, as you can see,
gives us m1 over the total mass,

64
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,650
and the second one is given us basically
minus sign, so this is resolve,

65
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,500
this when express, capital axis, small x.

66
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,450
We can do the same thing of course for
X2, and this is the result,

67
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,186
with the only difference here being m2 and
hre being plus sign.

68
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,450
And that's pretty much it.

69
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,190
So we can actually calculate
the quantity that we're after,

70
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,810
written here,
by essentially squaring this result.

71
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:28,000
So this would give us the x part of
the Laplacian for the first particle, and

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,760
this guy squared will give us the x
component applies to the second particle.

73
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:39,550
So therefore this guy goes here and
this result goes here.

74
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,340
And so you can see if we square root
this operation, these derivatives,

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,570
we're going to get the second derivative
with respect to the center of mass,

76
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,990
the second derivative with respect
to the relative coordinate but

77
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,300
also we're going to get the cross terms.

78
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,900
And actually the coordinates were chosen
in such a way that the cross terms

79
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,120
in these two brackets cancel each other
out because of the minus sign here and

80
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,710
plus sign here.

81
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,760
So, well, you can verify this of
course just by breaking it down or

82
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,710
just by staring at it for a minute or
so but it's going to be pretty clear.

83
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,833
So if you put everything
together from these two brackets,

84
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:22,648
a very straightforward calculation,
this is what we're going to get.

85
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,197
So this is essentially result for

86
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:31,298
the x component of this quantity we're
calculating and so Laplacian for x1 and

87
00:06:31,298 --> 00:06:37,398
x2 can now be written essentially as
a combination of two Laplacians with the,

88
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:41,238
yeah, there should be,
of course, a plus sign.

89
00:06:41,238 --> 00:06:44,759
Here there are no minus signs so
it was a typo.

90
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,413
And so the first Laplacian with respect
to this center of mass involves the total

91
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,390
mass in the denominator.

92
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,037
And the second Laplacian with respect
to the relative coordinate will

93
00:06:55,037 --> 00:06:57,768
this guy which actually is
called the reduced mass.

94
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,806
So now that we've tried it is s o m 1,

95
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:05,710
m 2 divided by m 1 + m 2, and
this is called reduced mass.

96
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,302
So now we're in the position to
actually put everything together,

97
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:17,121
so what we have proven as
a mater of fact is that,

98
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:22,084
minus h squared over 2m, 1,
Laplacian with respect to 1,

99
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:27,870
the kinetic energy, the first
particle minus a squared over 2m, 2.

100
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,128
Laplacian of two,
the kinetic energy of the second

101
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:38,507
particle can be written as
minus h squared over 2 m 1

102
00:07:38,507 --> 00:07:46,820
plus m 2 Laplacian with respect to the
center of mass minus h squared over 2 mew,

103
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,957
the reduced mass that I
introduced in the previous

104
00:07:51,957 --> 00:07:58,108
slide Laplacian with respect
to the relative coordinate.

105
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:02,680
So if I stick it into
the Schrodinger equation,

106
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,794
I will get, therefore, the full length,

107
00:08:06,794 --> 00:08:13,536
I will get minus h squared over 2,
this Laplacian of R m1 plus + m2,

108
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:19,710
plus Laplacian lower case r over
mew plus the potential energy,

109
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:25,087
the interaction energy between
the two particles which

110
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,946
depends only on this relative coordinate
acting on my wave function and

111
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:36,576
the right hand side is
just the energy as usual.

112
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:41,111
So what I see from this equation is
that there is just one part which

113
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:46,058
depends on the relative coordinate and
which involves interaction and

114
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:50,676
this part represents essentially
a free Schrodinger equation for

115
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:53,930
a combined particle with a mass, m1 + m2.

116
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,520
Essentially describes a free motion
of two particles, as a whole.

117
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,480
So for instance, if they were to form
a bond state this is exactly what we're

118
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,500
going to be discussing in
the last video in this lecture.

119
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,230
So, this term essentially describes
the motion of this bond state,

120
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,980
this sort of molecule like state,
as a whole.

121
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:23,100
And so to sort of extract this overall
motion, we can just look for a solution.

122
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,338
This side thilde of capital R and lower
case r can be written as a solution to

123
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:33,578
this sort of free Schroedinger equation,
simply a plain wave as we know,

124
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:38,563
it's E to the I, some momentum of
this bond state, or whatever it is,

125
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:43,042
times capital R, divided by H bar
times the wave function which

126
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:47,806
depends on the relative coordinate
that we actually want to find.

127
00:09:47,806 --> 00:09:54,370
And the energy of this motion from here
is going to be just this capital P,

128
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,616
squared divided by m1,
plus m2, twice m1 plus m2.

129
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:04,403
So, which is just the a parameter,
it doesn't appear anywhere

130
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:09,014
else in the problem and
we can just move it to the right hand side

131
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:13,820
subtract the total energy from
of this energy, and that's it.

132
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,210
The final result that we're going to get,

133
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,897
which doesn't want to include
this term is going to look,

134
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:25,798
let me just write it here,
is going to look as so.

135
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:31,726
So, it's going to be minus h squared
over 2 mew, so this reduced mass.

136
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:38,348
So these Laplacian in which I can write
as d2 over dr squared plus v of r.

137
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:42,750
Side of r, and

138
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,400
the reckon side is going to be this
e minus p squared over 2 m1 plus m2,

139
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,050
so let me just write it
as e prime psi of r.

140
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,946
And this, as you can see, looks like
single-particle Schroedinger equation.

141
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:02,770
So, the wave function
depends only one coordinate.

142
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,779
Everything else is exactly the same,

143
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,498
the only difference is that here
I'm dealing with some reduced mass.

144
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:13,611
So, let's see in the context of
the problem of two electrons

145
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:18,838
that we're actually going to study,
so E of m1 is equal to m2.

146
00:11:18,838 --> 00:11:23,078
So E of m1 is equal to m2.

147
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,212
So then, of course,

148
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:30,746
the total mass is equal to 2m.

149
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:39,218
And the reduced mass, this mew is equal
to m squared over 2m or just m over 2.

150
00:11:39,218 --> 00:11:43,602
So therefore, in our electron problem,

151
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:48,498
this guy is going to be
just the electron mass.

152
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:52,488
And, just to summarize
what we have proven,

153
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:57,528
why the brute force straight
forward calculation is that

154
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:04,038
in the simple two particle problem,
in two particle quantum mechanics,

155
00:12:04,038 --> 00:12:08,973
we can always get rid of one
unnecessary coordinate that

156
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:13,508
describes a motion of our
two particles as a whole.

157
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:18,166
And we can reduce our problem to the
standard single-particle quantum mechanics

158
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:22,013
which makes things much easier
because we can now use the results and

159
00:12:22,013 --> 00:12:26,065
