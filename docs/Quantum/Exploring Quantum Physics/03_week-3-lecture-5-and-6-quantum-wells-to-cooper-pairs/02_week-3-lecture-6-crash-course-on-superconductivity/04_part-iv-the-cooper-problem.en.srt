1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,920
So this final part of the lecture
we'll solve the Cooper problem

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,344
which is a problem of weakly
attractive electrons near the Fermi

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:17,610
surface that form pairs, so called Cooper
pairs, balance states of two electrons.

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,650
And as we discussed, these Cooper pairs,
at low temperatures,

5
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,550
they Bose condense into Bose-Einstein
condensate, which becomes superfluid.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,090
And this is this amazing state
that we know as a superconductor.

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,180
I should mention that this, we'll see
actually the solution to the Cooper

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:39,670
problem will involve essentially
the same method we used in

9
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,254
the first lecture this week in the context
of single particle quantum mechanics.

10
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:48,400
It's going to be actually very simple,
technically very simple solution for

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,880
a Nobel Prize winning work, anyway.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,800
So it's not trivial, but
this is a very important work.

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,150
So here I'm actually showing you the title
of the original paper by Leon Cooper.

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:05,540
And this work of Cooper eventually has

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,490
progressed, has developed into a much
more sophisticated theory, which is

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,130
the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory
of super conductivity, so, BCS-theory.

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,670
So and
this theory has been the cornerstone of

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,180
the theory of superconductivity for
many, many years.

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,480
And frankly there is nothing better
on the market, in some sense.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:34,150
So this BCS-theory describes very well
most conventional superconductors.

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,360
And it provides some of the setting
also in the physics of unconventional

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,330
superconductors, although they are such as
the high-temperature superconductors, for

23
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,400
example, though there
the understanding is not complete.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,540
Now let's say.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,820
Well, I showed many times already
the citations for various Nobel Prizes and

26
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:58,040
I discussed briefly a number of Nobel
Prize winning works and I should mention.

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,390
I should admit that in
most of these cases,

28
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,270
I had to sort of simplify
things enormously

29
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,060
when I was providing explanations,
sort of dumb it down to some degree.

30
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,430
So here, well,
I'm not going to discuss BCS-theory.

31
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,160
This is a very complicated theory, but

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,240
the paper of Cooper is actually very,
very simple.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,480
So the original paper, we started though
is very simple and we will be able

34
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,010
to understand, essentially,
its main message and the delegation.

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,147
Now but before I go into this delegation,

36
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,880
let me discuss the origin of
this attractive interaction.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,300
So I basically, what I want to solve
again is a problem of electrons

38
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,590
Interacting by an attractive potential.

39
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,910
But where exactly it's coming from?

40
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,963
So this is actually very complicated and
tricky question, and well, in some sense,

41
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,626
the mystery of, let's say, high
temperature and superconductivities and

42
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,045
that we don't really know
where this sort of glue,

43
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,560
this attractive interaction
might be coming from.

44
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,570
So the origin of electron attraction
in conventional superconductors

45
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,730
is also far from obvious actually.

46
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,870
So but there was a breakthrough paper
back in the beginning of the 50's so

47
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,040
I'm showing here the title of this paper.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,925
Superconductivity of Isotopes of Mercury
and to appreciate the importance of

49
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:20,535
this paper, let me just remind you,
the basic picture of what a metal is.

50
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:24,685
So well, if you have a metallic system,
well, a solid system,

51
00:03:24,685 --> 00:03:30,445
the reason it's a solid is because
the ions form a crystal lattice.

52
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:34,755
So they're positioned in space
in a regular fashion, so

53
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:39,667
I'm just drawing here for the sake of
simplicity a square lattice in 2-g,

54
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:42,920
but in reality would
be a more complicated.

55
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,446
Three dimensional lattice and you should
think about having a positive ions sitting

56
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:55,440
here in this sites,
on these lattice sites.

57
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,350
This lattice is a sort of elastic,
well it's a regent object,

58
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,079
but it can have oscillation.

59
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,140
Waves running through it.

60
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,650
And we're going to discuss it
a little bit in a few weeks.

61
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,160
And so this oscillations of
the lattice are called phonons.

62
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,800
Now electrons in the metal
are moving around,

63
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,520
they're free to move around, but they move
around on the background of this lattice.

64
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,340
So these red guys here are electrons,
okay?

65
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,950
And so this is pretty much what, well,
it's very cold model a simplified,

66
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,839
over simplified model
of a metallic source.

67
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,220
Now so this paper, what this paper has
achieved is that it looked at different

68
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,090
isotopes of mercury, which is a super
conductor and let me remind you

69
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,300
that isotopes are essentially different
versions of the same chemical elements.

70
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:57,210
And the basically everything is the same
for different isotopes apart from

71
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,940
the number of neutrons in each
ion sitting on the lattice side.

72
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,240
So basically with different isotopes
means that everything is the same but

73
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,650
the only difference is the mass of
this objects on the lattice sides,

74
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,320
Which maybe shouldn't affect
to much superconductivity,

75
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,120
because really superconductivity is
coming from whatever electrons are doing.

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,168
And it shouldn't have much to
do with the lattice, right?

77
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:26,583
So because these guys are actually, well,
they can oscillate a little bit near their

78
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:30,002
equilibrium positions, but
they cannot conduct electricity.

79
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:31,010
So what it turned out, and

80
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,780
this is really the main message of the
paper that the transition temperature into

81
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,790
a super conductor, the temperature at
which the resistivity drops exactly to 0,

82
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,340
depended very strongly on
the mass of these guys, okay?

83
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,020
So the ions,
the lower was the transition temperature.

84
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,756
See here, maybe it's hard to see so
there are a few points.

85
00:05:54,756 --> 00:05:59,642
This says average mass number and
this says transition

86
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:04,313
temperature so
this is basically if you write a TC and

87
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:09,105
this is the mass of these
Ions on lattice side, okay?

88
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:12,485
So this was a very clear-cut trend and

89
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:17,445
it was a smoking gun of that
superconductivity has something

90
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:22,765
to do with interactions between
the electrons and the crystal lattice.

91
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:26,995
So a little later people realize
that what actually happens is that

92
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:33,220
these electrons moving around,
whenever the electron passes

93
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,980
through a region in a lattice, essentially
because electron's negatively charged, and

94
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,270
the ion's sitting on lattice
size are positively charged.

95
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:49,360
So this electron polarizes the lattice
locally, and it takes some time for

96
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,920
the lattice sort of to relax back and
then if a second electron comes in.

97
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,290
So let's say I have here
now this guy goes away and

98
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,620
there is a second electron which
comes into the same region.

99
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,910
So, this second electron is
attracted in some sense To

100
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,520
this region and
this results in an effective correlation.

101
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,090
Effective phonon negated
attraction between the electrons.

102
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,230
It's a very tricky business.

103
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,750
If you don't understand it
well don't be surprised.

104
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,670
I don't understand it either actually.

105
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,290
So but that's how it works.

106
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,700
So we'll have to just accept this fact.

107
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,189
So that what happens is that electrons
in some sense, they exchange waves.

108
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,480
Elastic waves which are called phonons and
this leads to effective attraction.

109
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,620
Well and by the way for the module,
for the actual solution,

110
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,830
when I present the origin of the
attraction, it doesn't matter that much.

111
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,360
It will be just some attractions
are constant minus or

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,529
not but it's good to know the physics.

113
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,760
For the actual calculation we'll need

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,640
specific mathematical model of
this electron electron attraction.

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,580
And the true interaction
is quite complicated.

116
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,420
So here we'll represent
what I call a Spherical-cow

117
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,700
model of the phonon-mediated
attraction between electrons

118
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,460
Which I should say actually is used
commonly even in research papers.

119
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,950
So it works perfectly well.

120
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,410
And even though we know how
to write the true model,

121
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,510
which would involve all
the complications of the theory,

122
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,020
so the results, the outcome, so
we simplify the model in the and

123
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,080
more complicated model
are pretty close to each other.

124
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,220
So there's really no reason for
us to complicate things.

125
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,496
So in any case, so
what we're talking about is that again,

126
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:40,029
electrons moving around in
the presence of a crystal lattice,

127
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,991
this changes wave strength through
this lattice, these phonons and

128
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:49,097
so this diagram is an example
of a phonon-like diagram,

129
00:08:49,097 --> 00:08:52,540
which shows this kind of exchange.

130
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,850
And in any process like this,
we must satisfy basic conservation laws,

131
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,366
in particular we must
ensure that both energy.

132
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:03,230
And momentum are conserved.

133
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,390
So and therefore, what's important
here in understanding the structure

134
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,910
of this interaction is the typical
energies involved in such processes.

135
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,590
So what we know,

136
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:20,660
what we already discussed is the typical
energy of the electrons in the metal.

137
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,240
And this typical energy, I denote it as
E sub F, the Fermi energy, divided by

138
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,330
the Boltzmann constant, sort of to convert
it into a more familiar temperature units.

139
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,120
So the corresponding typical sort of
temperature of electrons is going to be

140
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,860
about 10,000 Kelvin.

141
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,680
So these guys which are actually
the main players of the theory have

142
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,940
the energy which is received
with this temperature scale.

143
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,010
Now it turns out that the phonons.

144
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,610
It's not obvious from the previous
discussion that Is not

145
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,790
something we can derive.

146
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,832
I'm just sort of giving
you an experimental fact,

147
00:09:56,832 --> 00:10:00,720
is that if the typical energy of
the phonons which I will call as age

148
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,249
times omega divide called bio-frequency
divided by the Boscom constant,

149
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:09,022
so when I wrote it into
temperature it's about 400 kelvin.

150
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,411
A few hundred kelvin,

151
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:14,881
which is two orders of magnitude
smaller than the energy of the lattice.

152
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:19,524
So what we should think about is that
this phonon as actually being changed by

153
00:10:19,524 --> 00:10:22,062
the electrons have energy which is much,

154
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:25,860
much more then the energy life,
the electron energy itself.

155
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,835
And this puts certain
constraints on the possible

156
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:36,150
momentum energies of the electrons that
may experience this sort of a process.

157
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,730
And the simplest sort of version of the
interaction which takes this into account

158
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,800
is presented here.

159
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,135
So this is an equation for an interaction,

160
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:51,210
momentum-dependent interaction
between the two electrons, V(p) And

161
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:57,620
what it tells us is that the two electrons
attract each other in this language

162
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,790
if they're located in the narrow
shell near the thermo-surface.

163
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,570
And the width of the shell is of
the order of this phonon energy.

164
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,676
So basically if two electrons can
exchange phonons they do so and

165
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:16,858
this results in the interaction
which is manifested here through

166
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:20,521
this negative coefficient
that we know as sum constant.

167
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:26,290
And if two electrons are located
well beyond this narrow region.

168
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,880
So then they don't have a mechanism
to attract each other and

169
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,050
their interaction therefore is zero.

170
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:38,730
So if we move just at the upper part,
so V of P is equal to minus V zero so

171
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,980
this would correspond to essentially
a local attraction real space, so this

172
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,650
is something we actually saw In lecture
number five with the Delta potential.

173
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,977
So this is the kind of
problem we discussed already.

174
00:11:53,977 --> 00:12:02,030
But however then we were talking
about one particle in a quantum well.

175
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,090
So now we're talking about two particles,

176
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,600
two excitations interacting with
each other via this potential.

177
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,280
But per, well, per the results of
the previous segment in this lecture,

178
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,310
we know that the two particle problem in
quantum mechanics is to a large degree,

179
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,300
equivalent to a single particle
quantum mechanical problems.

180
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,650
And as we discussed in the previous video,

181
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,800
the only difference between the single
particle problem and a potential VFr and

182
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,470
two particle problem of
two particles interacting.

183
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,290
Why the same potential Is that
in the lecture, we will get

184
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,690
the reduced mass instead of the mass
of each individual particle.

185
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,040
And in the case of two
identical electrons,

186
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,600
the reduced mass is equal to m over two,
so we have simply this here equation.

187
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,530
And here I write it first in real speed,
sort of, while keeping in mind that there

188
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,720
are in fact additional
constraints on the interaction.

189
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,400
So if we follow the same

190
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,940
route as we did in lecture number five and
do free transform.

191
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,150
So we can write this
equation in this form, so

192
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,500
delta of r acting on psi
of r picks up psi of 0.

193
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,920
And so here I'm going to have this
integrate of over, of momentum but

194
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,800
basically we do introduce constraints on
the potential that we just discussed.

195
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,648
Would be to limit the integration or
momentum here by only

196
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:40,597
momenta that appear in the vicinity
of the Fermi surface so

197
00:13:40,597 --> 00:13:45,200
that the possibility of
phonon exchange exists.

198
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,420
And so this equation, essentially,

199
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,510
these two equations with
the proper sort of caveats.

200
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,060
About where the interaction is possible,
is exactly the Cooper pairing problem.

201
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,690
And as you can see, it's essentially
identical mathematically to the Kaiser

202
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,018
problems we saw in lecture number five
in single particle quantum mechanics.

203
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:09,200
And so
well we can follow the same route, but

204
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,090
at this stage you may be a little bit
surprised at by this resemblance.

205
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:19,100
Because I mentioned that this eventually,
the result of this calculation,

206
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,140
is going to be the appearance of a bounce
state between the two electrons.

207
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,370
But as we discussed,
weak attraction in three dimensions,

208
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,360
and this is a three dimensional problem,
does not result in a bounce state.

209
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,800
So delta function, potentially 3D
does not have a bounce however,

210
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,970
an interesting thing that happens here
is that because electrons that really

211
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,380
play a role in this pairing,
in this interaction with phonons,

212
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,250
they exist in the vicinity
of this Fermi surface.

213
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,100
And this surface is two dimensional.

214
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,610
This gives rise, in a sense,
to a reduction of dimensionality,

215
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,170
even though in real space we started
with a three dimensional system.

216
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,040
So this effectively, what we're dealing
with here has a reduced dimension.

217
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:17,883
And this gives rise to the appearance of
a bond state in a very unexpected way.

218
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:22,810
So to see this, we essentially have
to repeat exactly the same steps as

219
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,340
we did in parts three and
four of lecture number five.

220
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,170
So, the only difference here is
due to the fact that this energy

221
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,570
on the right hand side that we want
to find really consists of two parts.

222
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,440
So, this is the n ratio of the electrons
that already have a finite energy at

223
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,580
the Fermi surface, so
remember is that we're

224
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,040
talking here about these excitations
that have the energy of two e-Fermi.

225
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,970
And then there is an energy due to the
interaction which we want to be negative.

226
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:01,440
So if this guy delta is negative, it
means that we can have former bond state.

227
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,230
And by doing so, lower the energy so and

228
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,670
well this fact actually makes
all the difference actually.

229
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,283
This is how mathematically the fact that
we are dealing with this 3 dimensional

230
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,828
Fermi surface when it fixes itself.

231
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:24,210
Since the remaining calculation follows
almost 1 to 1 back in lecture number 5.

232
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,300
And I also present this
particular calculation and

233
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,950
all the details in additional materials so
you can read through this.

234
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,110
So I'm not going to repeat this again
in this video, so what I'm going to do,

235
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,250
I'm going to just present the final
result for this key parameter delta.

236
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,600
Which again is the energy of
the bound state of two electrons

237
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,480
that forms sort of a large morticle if you
want, which is called Cooper pair here.

238
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,930
So, and this delta is going to
be of of the order of minus

239
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,055
so this is a phonon energy,

240
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:04,450
typical phonon energy that we
discussed in the previous slide.

241
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:09,350
But the key thing here is that there are
multiplied by a exponential of minus 1,

242
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:14,020
some constant, I'll call it N not and
define it in a second, times V not.

243
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,840
So where N not is equal to m P Fermi, so

244
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:24,540
this is threshold momentum
divided by 4 Pi squared h cubed.

245
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,590
So this is just a constant but
what I want to emphasize,

246
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,370
well first of all there is a solution.

247
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,170
Which is great.

248
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,260
So the electrons indeed can find a way
to lower their energy by forming these

249
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,080
bizarre new Cooper pairs that
eventually form the superconductor.

250
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,810
But what is not so great is that
these small interaction energy

251
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,870
appears in the exponential minus 1 or
V not.

252
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:56,520
So if V0 is small, then, well,
the energy of the bounce state,

253
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,650
the so-called superconducting gap,
is exponentially small.

254
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,970
And this is exactly what happens.

255
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,470
And those of you who followed
all of segments in lecture

256
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,680
number five can recognize this
result is a result that we

257
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,400
have seen actually in the context of two
dimensional single particle problem.

258
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,390
And this reflects this reduction in
dimensionality that I mentioned before.

259
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:27,050
So, the last two things I'm going to
mention in the end is first of all this

260
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,040
result for delta is a function of
V not is very unusual function,

261
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,380
which we have already seen.

262
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,760
But this function is,

263
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,430
again, is special because it
doesn't have a Taylor expansion.

264
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,200
So there is no way one
can approach this result

265
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,530
by doing so-called perturbation theory.

266
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,290
And this may be one of
the reasons why It took so

267
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,510
long for people to figure out
the key to superconductivity

268
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,740
because there was no way to approach
it sort of in a pejorative way.

269
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,970
And the last thing I'm
going to mention is that well,

270
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,220
if we did not have this exponential,

271
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,150
if we were to imagine that this Delta or
the water of this funnel energy.

272
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,580
This would have actually implied
that we can get superconductivity

273
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,120
at very high temperatures,
up to room temperature.

274
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,380
So this would have been great.

275
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,555
We would have the ability to
transport electricity with no losses.

276
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:23,145
So this is really the grand
challenge in the field,

277
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,665
so how to you go beyond
this weak coupling.

278
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:29,222
So weak coupling, here in model so how to

279
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:33,012
first of all to describe the situation
where the interactions are strong and

280
00:19:33,012 --> 00:19:36,252
how to enhance, how to get rid
of this exponential essentially.

281
00:19:36,252 --> 00:19:39,742
This is a sort of practical problem
that has no solution at the moment.
