1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.484
Superconductivity is an example of
an intrinsically many-bodied quantum

2
00:00:06.484 --> 00:00:10.960
effect which doesn't really have
a single particle counterpart.

3
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.240
So it can't be really understood based on
a single particle trend or equation So

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.980
in the context of superconductors of
course, these many particles are electrons

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.550
that play together in some sense to create
this amazing quantum hearing state.

6
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.280
Now to understand the very
complicated array of many.

7
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.100
Body quantum phenomena.

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.890
The first step is to understand
the concept of quantum statistics,

9
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.540
which is an intrinsically quantum
interaction between identical

10
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.349
particles that does really
have a classical counterpart.

11
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.640
So let's say the electrostatic let's say
pulling interaction which depends on

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.780
distance and between the two charges.

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.150
So this statistical interaction between
identical particles is quite different.

14
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.480
It's imperish whenever you
have identical particles.

15
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.500
They feel each other's presence

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.740
independently of the distance
separating data.

17
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.320
So this is very interesting.

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.460
And so we're going to learn about it and
also we are going to learn about the two

19
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.110
fundamental classes of particles

20
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.789
with respect to their quantum statistics
like all the bosons and fermions.

21
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.030
And those guys, they lose energy states
[INAUDIBLE] are drastically different.

22
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.860
And we will see that it's actually
a transition in some sense from fermions

23
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.690
like behavior to bosons like behavior
Is exactly what explain Transition

24
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.670
from a regular metal into
quantum superconductors.

25
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.570
Just a few step in defining
quantum statistics.

26
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.860
Let us consider two identical
quantum particles represent

27
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.730
by this blue dust here.

28
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.520
Now let's assume that all
intrinsic properties of

29
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.440
these particles are exactly the same.

30
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.310
And so the question that we're going
to be asking is what happens if we

31
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.020
breathe two particles, in other words
if these two particles exchange places.

32
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.000
So the first particle goes to the place
of the second one and vice versa.

33
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.540
So what it means is that the we

34
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.200
function in this case the wave function
describing these two partial system,

35
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.383
depends, well on the coordinate
of these two partials and

36
00:02:36.383 --> 00:02:39.160
one or two principle some other
quantum that I'm not written.

37
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.450
And so the question we're asking what
happens with this wave function if you

38
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.440
replace r 2 with r 2 and
in vice versa, so it turns out that,

39
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.370
upon this braiding the wave function
requires quantum mechanical phase.

40
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.820
Which is this statistical
phase of hoop 5 and

41
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.335
well, we can sort of get an idea of why
it might happen because the wave function

42
00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:05.845
really is a tool for us to understand
the observable phenomenon.

43
00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:10.995
Most observables answer through
the absolute value of the wave function or

44
00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:13.435
the various metric elements
of the wave function and

45
00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:17.240
the overall face is not really
something that we worry about.

46
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.410
And so we may imagine that even though
from our perspective nothing has changed

47
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.500
since the two particles are identical
whether which one is at which

48
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.092
point doesn't really matter so
we still main principle get

49
00:03:29.092 --> 00:03:33.020
the quantum mechanical phase here and
indeed this happens.

50
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.155
Okay?

51
00:03:34.155 --> 00:03:40.720
So,and so the question that we can ask and
it was asked a long time ago.

52
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.430
What are the possible values of
the quantum statistical phase?

53
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.280
And the answer provided
in his seminal paper.

54
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.020
Entitled, The Connection Between Spin and
Statistics by Wolfgang Pauli.

55
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.660
Who proved that there exists a one-to-one
correspondence between the internal

56
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.310
angular momentum of a particle so called
(spin), That you're going to learn about

57
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.480
a little later in the course and
is quantum statistics.

58
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.260
So, I won't give you a lecture on spin,
because there will be separate

59
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.840
one on that, but I will just mention that
there are just two types of particles

60
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.970
allowed in nature which are,
either integer or half integer spin.

61
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.330
And those differ by how their wave
functions transform other rotations.

62
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.100
So if we rotate our OSA coordinate
system by a certain angle so

63
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.840
this rotation operator that we encounter
would look differently depending

64
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.680
on what kind of spin the particle has and
interestingly enough lets say

65
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.680
spin one half particles, an electron
is an example of such a particle,

66
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.660
its going to be described by circular
presentation of this rotation which upon

67
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.960
repeating it by 360 degrees
actually picks up a minus sign.

68
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.680
As opposed to integer spin particles or

69
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.090
particles with no spins
that don't really change.

70
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.680
Whose weight function does their own
change upon this rotation by 360 degrees.

71
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.890
Now I'm just sort of giving you
a flavor but the outcome of this

72
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:30.300
spin statistics theorem can be
formulated in a very simple way.

73
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.500
So for particles with integer internal
angular momentum including zero,

74
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.240
the phase here is really 0, so
there's no change in the wave function.

75
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.010
If we replace r1 by r2, nothing changes.

76
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.447
While for
particles with half-integer spin,

77
00:05:48.447 --> 00:05:51.930
this statistical piece thi is equal to pi,

78
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.720
or in other words this sine of r1 and
r2 is equal to minus of sine of r2 and r1.

79
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.969
And this guy's with Huffinger's spin
are half measure spins with fermions.

80
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.900
So just make one comment that it
turns out that this classification

81
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.910
is specific to three-dimensional

82
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.600
relativistic quantum theory to
the world in which we actually live.

83
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.550
But if we consider two
dimensional systems,

84
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.000
which appear as a matter of fact in,
let's say, condense metric context,

85
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.250
so we have three dimensional metals and
two dimensional super conductors.

86
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.820
So there, it turns out that
the possibilities of r phi

87
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.600
are much more interesting,
so apart from zero and

88
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.895
pi we may have extra phase of phi of
which I call in the particles like that.

89
00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:43.406
So the vectinians emerging particles
like that are called any ions and

90
00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:45.555
they run this phi can be a matrix.

91
00:06:45.555 --> 00:06:46.203
In which case,

92
00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:50.895
they're called anonabilian, but this is
the only I'm going to mention about it.

93
00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:55.460
I just want you to know that apart from
these well known possibilities For

94
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.620
fundamental elementary
particles there are other

95
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.050
situations which arise in
condensed metaphysics.

96
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:10.020
But now, let me focus on these two cases.

97
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.720
So for regular particles,
we have either zero or pi.

98
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.379
So let's assume we're dealing with
fermions let's assume electrons, so

99
00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:24.106
what are the consequences of this minus
sign that we pick up in front of the wave

100
00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:24.930
function.

101
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.200
Doesn't really matter,
it also should be word law.

102
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.439
So let us think about it.

103
00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:37.072
So now what we're really saying again is
that psi r1 and r2 =- psi of r and r1.

104
00:07:37.072 --> 00:07:42.680
And it immediately leads
to a conclusion that for

105
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.194
important keys r1=r2 psi for r1 and

106
00:07:47.194 --> 00:07:50.885
r1 is equals to miles psi r1 and

107
00:07:50.885 --> 00:07:55.556
r1 which means this side is equal to 0.

108
00:07:55.556 --> 00:07:56.960
So what does it mean?

109
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.790
It means that the probability of
finding two identical fermions in

110
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:05.076
the same point is zero,
because psi is zero.

111
00:08:05.076 --> 00:08:09.505
So well, and
it means that no two identical

112
00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:13.328
fermions can occupy the same point.

113
00:08:13.328 --> 00:08:17.024
And more generally, it turns out that
we can actually generalize this for

114
00:08:17.024 --> 00:08:19.658
an arbitrary representation
of the wave function.

115
00:08:19.658 --> 00:08:23.422
We can prove and, well,
this is the Pauli exclusion principle,

116
00:08:23.422 --> 00:08:27.700
is that no two identical fermions
can occupy the same quantum state.

117
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.640
They cannot have exactly
the same quantum numbers.

118
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.386
But there's no such constraint for bosons.

119
00:08:33.386 --> 00:08:37.450
Okay, so
this has very important consequences.

120
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.480
So this statement again is called
the Pauli exclusion principle, and

121
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.920
for bosons that doesn't apply.

122
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:49.990
And the consequences are that if
we have a certain quantum state,

123
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:56.300
let's say an arbitrary quantum state i,
and we want to populate this state with

124
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.550
fermions, there are only two possibilities
for the occupation number of this state.

125
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.660
So the occupation number can either 0 or
1.

126
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.979
Well, for bosons it can be anything.

127
00:09:04.979 --> 00:09:11.780
It can be any 0, 1, 2, can put any number
of bosons we want in this quantum state.

128
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.200
Now what does it mean in
the context of many-body systems,

129
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.930
when we have actually more than one and
two particles,

130
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.160
when we have billions and
billions of identical particles,

131
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.490
as we usually do in quantum systems such
as, let's say, metals and superconductors?

132
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.550
So let us discuss this question first for
a many-boson system,

133
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.620
and what we're actually asking
is what happens, let's say,

134
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:45.300
if we have many energy levels
that are initially empty.

135
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:50.550
And we want to know what happens if we
sort of pour identical bosons into this

136
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.620
prescribed landscape of quantum
states with some states i,

137
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.540
with some energies E sub i.

138
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.560
And more specifically what
we're interested in is,

139
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.230
what is the lowest energy state,
the so-called ground state,

140
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:10.620
that the system would want
to form at low temperatures.

141
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.238
So at low temperatures, the excitations
are going to sort of calm down, and

142
00:10:15.238 --> 00:10:18.718
the system would want to form
the lowest-energy state.

143
00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:23.968
Now since any number of bosons can occupy
any state, so clearly the lowest-energy

144
00:10:23.968 --> 00:10:28.243
state would correspond to essentially
a state in which all bosons,

145
00:10:28.243 --> 00:10:33.646
non-interacting bosons, that is, are
sitting just at the lowest possible level.

146
00:10:33.646 --> 00:10:39.462
Now for a free particle, with dispersion
just having kinetic energy dispersion

147
00:10:39.462 --> 00:10:45.449
p squared over 2 m, some sort of parabolic
dispersion here I'm just plotting it,

148
00:10:45.449 --> 00:10:51.264
in sort of an example of a two-dimensional
system Px Py, and this is the energy,

149
00:10:51.264 --> 00:10:56.431
basically all bosons would want to
drop into this zero momentum state.

150
00:10:56.431 --> 00:11:01.048
Okay, and this kind of state is
called Bose-Einstein condensate,

151
00:11:01.048 --> 00:11:04.710
the state in which a single
quantum mechanical level,

152
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:10.540
in this case the state of zero momentum or
zero velocity is microscopically occupied.

153
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:16.925
So this kind of phenomenon has been known
for a long time, since Einstein, but

154
00:11:16.925 --> 00:11:23.628
it was sort of very observed in a clear
way only very recently, in 1995 first.

155
00:11:23.628 --> 00:11:26.972
Now it's observed routinely in
various laboratories including our

156
00:11:26.972 --> 00:11:28.478
own Joint Quantum Institute.

157
00:11:28.478 --> 00:11:30.739
But back in 1995, it was new, and

158
00:11:30.739 --> 00:11:34.996
this discovery was actually awarded
2001 Nobel Prize in physics.

159
00:11:34.996 --> 00:11:37.790
So here I'm showing the following.

160
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:43.408
So basically what the experimentalists
did, they trapped atoms, bosonic atoms,

161
00:11:43.408 --> 00:11:48.550
in a confined geometry in a certain
trapping potential and cooled them down to

162
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.638
ultra-cool temperatures, and
then removed the trap and let them expand.

163
00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:58.919
And they just took photographs
of these atoms as time went by,

164
00:11:58.919 --> 00:12:00.960
and they saw this peak.

165
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.944
So this is basically the so-called time
of flight expansion, and this peak is,

166
00:12:04.944 --> 00:12:10.240
shows a population,
a density of particles in real space.

167
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.407
So you see that a large number
of particles sort of don't

168
00:12:14.407 --> 00:12:18.840
move too much as time goes by,
and these peaks sort of in real

169
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.558
space is a manifestation of
condensation and momentum space.

170
00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:28.580
So this correspond to particles with zero
velocity, so they just sort of stay still.

171
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.945
So now I would like to mention a very
important circumstance, namely, that these

172
00:12:33.945 --> 00:12:41.320
Bose-Einstein condensates may host a very
interesting phenomenon of superfluidity,

173
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.790
where the condensate of interacting
bosons form a superfluid

174
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.400
which has exactly zero viscosity and which
can flow, therefore, without resistance.

175
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:57.295
So here, for example, I'm showing a photo
of a superfluid helium in a cup, and

176
00:12:57.295 --> 00:13:01.108
the helium can actually escape
the cup climbing up the walls.

177
00:13:01.108 --> 00:13:05.622
So let me mention that
the phenomenon of superfluidity has

178
00:13:05.622 --> 00:13:10.778
actually been known for a very,
very long time, since 1937,

179
00:13:10.778 --> 00:13:15.035
and it was discovered then
in helium by Pyotr Kapitsa.

180
00:13:16.565 --> 00:13:21.185
And Kapitsa got his Nobel Prize for
this discovery in 1978, well,

181
00:13:21.185 --> 00:13:25.625
a bit too late,
40 years after the initial discovery.

182
00:13:25.625 --> 00:13:28.525
So the mathematical theory of
superfluidity was put together by

183
00:13:28.525 --> 00:13:33.460
Lev Landau, a famous Russian
theorist who got his Nobel Prize for

184
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.270
this theory in 1962, so
actually before Kapitsa.

185
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.860
And let me just mention that

186
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:44.890
this Nobel Prize was awarded to him after
Landau got into a very serious accident.

187
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.500
Everybody thought he wouldn't survive,
but by some miracle he lived for

188
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:49.410
a few more years, and

189
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.270
this allowed the Nobel Committee to
award him a long overdue Nobel Prize.

190
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.412
So in any case,

191
00:13:55.412 --> 00:13:59.895
I'm not going to talk too much about the
theory of this superfluidity now, because

192
00:13:59.895 --> 00:14:04.831
it actually requires understanding of the
interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates,

193
00:14:04.831 --> 00:14:08.630
and this is a non-trivial business
interacting many-body states.

194
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.331
But I will just mention that
superfluidity sort of rings of bell in

195
00:14:14.331 --> 00:14:16.875
the context of superconductivity,

196
00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:22.288
because if we want to explain the main
property of a superconductor, namely,

197
00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:27.375
zero resistance state in the
superconductor, we would want essentially

198
00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:32.896
superfluid of electrons which would
move zero viscosity without resistance.

199
00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:36.338
So this is exactly what
the doctor has prescribed.

200
00:14:36.338 --> 00:14:42.054
But there is one little problem with
this explanation of superconductivity,

201
00:14:42.054 --> 00:14:46.134
namely, well,
electrons in the metal are not bosons.

202
00:14:46.134 --> 00:14:49.640
They have a half integer spin one-half, so

203
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.011
they were fermions, so
they do not form a superfluid.

204
00:14:54.011 --> 00:14:56.420
So what do they do?

205
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.457
And to answer this question,

206
00:14:58.457 --> 00:15:02.950
I need to consider the ground
state of many-fermion system now.

207
00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.980
We talked about the ground
state of bosons.

208
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:10.330
Now let me talk about what
happens with fermions if I pour

209
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:13.320
them into a given energy landscape.

210
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.920
Let's say I have some available levels,
and I have a many-fermion system

211
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.660
that would want to occupy those levels,
and the question is how I minimize energy.

212
00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.080
So due to the Pauli exclusion principle,

213
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.446
I cannot allow my fermions to be sitting
on the same lowest-energy state.

214
00:15:29.446 --> 00:15:34.570
So at minimized energy I can only
sort of stack them up one by

215
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:40.846
one to the lowest-energy states,
as so, until they reach the certain

216
00:15:40.846 --> 00:15:46.198
level called the fermion level,
or fermion energy up here.

217
00:15:46.198 --> 00:15:50.820
And basically this is the picture
of fermion ground state,

218
00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.264
which is quite different from
the bosonic ground state.

219
00:15:55.264 --> 00:16:01.133
Now, in the context of a three-dimensional
metal, so what we have is,

220
00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:07.004
well, our energy landscape is given
by the usual dispersion relation,

221
00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:11.750
the energy versus momentum is
equal to p squared over 2m.

222
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.239
So, what I need to do in order to sort
of satisfy the same picture with this

223
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:22.800
energy is that I will
occupy all momentum states.

224
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.470
So here I have kx, ky, and kz or
could have regular px, py, and pz.

225
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.570
So below a certain momentum
which is called Fermi momentum,

226
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.570
I will have all states occupied.

227
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.090
Just like I have here all these levels
occupied while these levels are all empty.

228
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:42.750
So in the threshold momentum, just ignore
this red and white dots for the moment.

229
00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.710
So below this threshold momentum,
I have all states occupied,

230
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:51.120
above this threshold momentum
I have all states empty.

231
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.710
And this is exactly the picture
which describes electrons in metals,

232
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.602
actually works amazingly well for metals.

233
00:16:58.602 --> 00:17:03.034
And it's also known that the typical
Fermi temperature in a metal,

234
00:17:03.034 --> 00:17:07.000
the Fermi temperature being
this threshold momentum here,

235
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.731
the PF squared divided by 2m,
this is the Fermi energy,

236
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:15.810
divided by the Boltzmann constant which
converts energy into temperature.

237
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.752
So if we do this calculation, the typical
Fermi temperature in a metal would

238
00:17:19.752 --> 00:17:22.290
be around 10,000 Kelvin, which is huge.

239
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.521
So even at room temperature,
let alone at 4 Kelvin, so

240
00:17:26.521 --> 00:17:31.485
this energy scale is normal compared
to all other energy scales.

241
00:17:31.485 --> 00:17:35.993
What the final temperature
usually does is that it excites

242
00:17:35.993 --> 00:17:39.217
electrons from below the Fermi surface.

243
00:17:39.217 --> 00:17:41.493
So for instance, I cannot excite
an electron from here to here.

244
00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:42.667
I cannot move.

245
00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:46.526
So this, let me just draw this process and
then I will say it's not allowed, so

246
00:17:46.526 --> 00:17:50.755
I have let's say, an electron here, I can
move it to this point so it's not allowed.

247
00:17:50.755 --> 00:17:55.744
Because both these states are occupied,
so this state's already occupied so

248
00:17:55.744 --> 00:17:58.860
power exclusion would
allow me to do this thing.

249
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:04.010
But what I can do if I have temperature
I have some energy to spend, so

250
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.320
I can excite an electron,
let's say, from here to here.

251
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:13.700
So the white point here is an empty
space that the electron leaves behind is

252
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.120
called a hole and the red one is
the actual electronic excitation.

253
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.540
This is exactly the picture of a metal.

254
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.240
And so, these guys basically,
these red guys and these white guys,

255
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.880
these guys form, basically they
are the main players in a typical metal.

256
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.070
But they do not both condense.

257
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.063
They don't form a super-fluid,
they just move around,

258
00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:38.604
and they experience scattering from
one point to a different point,

259
00:18:38.604 --> 00:18:41.750
and this results in the finite resistance.

260
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:46.330
So how do we reconcile this picture
of a metal with the presence of

261
00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:51.200
superconductivities that is
observed at low temperatures?

262
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.720
So this was again,
a major mystery for many, many years.

263
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.890
Was not at all obvious how to do this.

264
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.330
But of course, there was a hint about
due to the presence of superfluid.

265
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:04.250
So and well, sort of in retrospect,
it's pretty natural to ask

266
00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:09.260
whether or not it's possible to
somehow convert an electron liquid.

267
00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.020
So this is a physical Fermi
liquid into bosonic superfluid.

268
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.980
So this guys a fermion,
so they're not bosons.

269
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:21.040
So can we make bosonic superfluid to go
out of the fermionic gas, such as here.

270
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.155
Well, it's difficult unless,

271
00:19:24.155 --> 00:19:29.050
I allow my electrons to form
composite objects of two

272
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:34.190
electron states whose total
spin is either 1 over 0.

273
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:37.260
Remember the spin of a single
electron is one-half but

274
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.000
if I combine the two of them together,
so it's going to be an integer.

275
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.415
So they were going to be bosons.

276
00:19:42.415 --> 00:19:45.775
And so if I somehow find
a way to form such objects,

277
00:19:45.775 --> 00:19:49.625
well, I could have actually
drawn it like this.

278
00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:55.795
But well, knowing the results,
I'm drawing these objects this way.

279
00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:57.775
But at this stage it doesn't matter.

280
00:19:57.775 --> 00:20:01.749
So if I allow the formation
of two electron states,

281
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.520
these two electrons states
are going to be bosons.

282
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.170
And these bosons would be
able to bose condense and

283
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:13.330
these guys would be able to form
a superfluid, now a charged superfluid.

284
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:17.240
And this is great because
this state will superconduct.

285
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.920
And this exactly what happens.

286
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.149
And this balance states of two electrons
are called Cooper pairs, and from

287
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:30.130
this perspective a superconductor is a
Bose-Einstein condensate of Cooper pairs.

288
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.352
But the main question that remains is
why these Cooper pairs would form?

289
00:20:35.352 --> 00:20:37.610
Why would such states appear?

290
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.460
And this is the question that we are
actually going to answer in the remaining

291
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.730
two segments.

292
00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.518
And we're going to solve
the Cooper pairing problem.

293
00:20:46.518 --> 00:20:50.080
And this was also established
connection between this lecture and

294
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.770
the previous lecture when we discussed
bounce states and weak potentials.
