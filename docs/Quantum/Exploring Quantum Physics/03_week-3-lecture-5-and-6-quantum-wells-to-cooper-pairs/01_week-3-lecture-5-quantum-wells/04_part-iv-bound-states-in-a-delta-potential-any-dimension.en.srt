1
00:00:00,759 --> 00:00:06,328
So now we're going to address the same
question addressed in the previous video,

2
00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:11,333
namely the question about the existence
of a bound state in an arbitrarily

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:17,006
weak shallow potential well, but now we'll
do so in more than one demonstration.

4
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:21,632
I should mention that there are actually
very few problems in quantum mechanics in

5
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:26,130
2D and 3D which allow relatively
simple analytical solution.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,390
Most often, in these cases, we have to
resort to either numerical analysis or

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:35,660
a rather technically complicated
mathematical calculations.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,250
Well, the solution I'm going to
present is not exactly trivial.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,910
It will require a lot of thinking.

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,970
But otherwise it will follow almost
one to one the steps that we

11
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,060
used in the solution of
the one-dimensional delta-potential.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,830
However, very importantly the result of
these steps is going to be quite different

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,520
in 2D and 3D.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,810
So namely, for those of you who
want to skip the technical part and

15
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,970
just to get through the bottom line, so I
will just tell you the result right away.

16
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:08,710
So unlike in one dimension where the
energy of, first of all the bound state

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,300
always exist and the energy of the bound
state in the weak potential scale is

18
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,580
sort of as a power loses as a second
power low of strength of the potential.

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,170
In two dimensions it turns out
that the level also always exists,

20
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,720
but the energy of the level is extremely,
extremely small.

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,390
So the level is very shallow and the
energy of the level scales exponentially

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,720
in a very unusual form with
the strength of the production.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,140
And this actually has very important
consequences in many cases

24
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,870
in particular and it relates to a certain
calculation we're going to discuss

25
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,320
in the theory of super
conductivity a little later.

26
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,010
And also, in three dimension, it turns
out that there is no level at all.

27
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,840
So if you have a very weak
attraction between particles.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,520
So for example, a very weak potential.

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,316
Well there is, so this attraction,
attraction is not going to

30
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:05,935
induce a bound state and
this fact is also very important.

31
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:10,309
Now let me prove the statements I just
made and prove the solution is going to

32
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:15,240
follow very closely as already mentioned
the solution that we had in one dimension,

33
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,006
we started from the stranger equation for
the delta potential.

34
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:22,955
So now of course we have to
deal with this regular equation

35
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:27,729
in our dimension where wave function
now is a function of a vector r and

36
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:33,212
the kinetic energy now involved
is in contrast to this over x.

37
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:36,510
And finally the delta function
is the delta function is

38
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,900
sort of a sharp peaking function
in the D dimensional space.

39
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,820
So let's say in 3D so,
this delta far is simply the product

40
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,780
of the delta function of x, delta
function of y and delta function of z.

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,690
So, the first step in
the solution just like in 1D

42
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,600
involves a free transforming our equation.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,020
So essentially we go from
the wave function, real space to

44
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,220
the image of the wave function memento
space or more criticize the wave vector.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,810
So the only difference in time dimension
is that we have transform is slightly more

46
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,720
complicated so it transforms along
each of the directions, x, y, z, etc.

47
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,090
So if we were in higher dimensions.

48
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,430
And so if we perform this slightly
more complicated transform.

49
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:36,020
So the kinetic energy which is basically
this derivative becomes minus k squared.

50
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,630
The delta function,

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,650
the free image of delta function just
like the one I mentioned is simply one.

52
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,600
And so
we get to the following equation which

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,440
is just the linear equation for
the image of the [INAUDIBLE] function.

54
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,830
And this you see there is essentially no
difference between the one dimensional

55
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,166
case and the [INAUDIBLE] dimensional
case apart from the fact that this guy

56
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,250
now is a vector.

57
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,530
And while this guy was just a one
dimensional component of the wave vector.

58
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,350
So again we can of course solve
this equation for side tilde to k.

59
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,450
So we're going to have the same
side of zero divided by h squared

60
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,540
K squared over 2m and I will write it
as plus absolute value of the energy.

61
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,700
Again, we are looking for bound state and

62
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,660
we know that the bound state must
be negative if it exists at all.

63
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,850
And using exactly
the same trick as before,

64
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,840
we're going to integrate this
equation both sides of this equation.

65
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,840
Now over the entire three
dimensional space of this.

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,520
So and if we do so,
we come up with self consistency

67
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,060
equation which again in 1D in higher
dimensions look almost the same.

68
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,390
So the only difference
is that the integral

69
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,490
here is going to over to
a higher dimensional space.

70
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,660
So it turns out that this difference,
the fact that we are now integrating over

71
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,140
high dimensional space leads to
very important consequences for

72
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,740
the actual solution of this equation.

73
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,620
Here we knew that doesn't matter how
small alpha is as long as it's non 0,

74
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,930
we can always find an energy that
would satisfy this equation.

75
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,830
So now it turns out that for
high dimensions,

76
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,580
it's not going to happen necessarily.

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,080
Let's say for D greater than 2,
there will be no solution so and

78
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,540
to see this, we actually have to calculate
this integral that appears in this

79
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,430
consistency equation
that was just derived.

80
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,020
So to do so, we should first notice
that the function that we're actually

81
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,440
integrating does not depend on
the directions of the wave.

82
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,590
It only depends on this absolute value.

83
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,671
So let's say in two dimensions,
we can write d2k as a dk

84
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:56,079
times k which is essentially
corresponds to an integrating

85
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,730
over the absolute value of k
times d five of k which is

86
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,835
the angle that the vector k
forms with the x directions.

87
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:10,610
So let's say this is our
three dimensional k space,

88
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,623
this would be k of y,
this would be k of x and so

89
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:19,635
this is our vector k so
this would be the angle five of k.

90
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:23,232
So, what I'm saying here
is that the equation,

91
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:26,304
this equation that we're looking at, so

92
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:31,240
it can be written as alpha D2k,
in this case, over 2 pi squared.

93
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,140
So this function, and we can write it as
simply, well, alpha over 2 pi squared.

94
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,620
Oops, squared is here so

95
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,640
dk times k over this function
are from 0 to infinity.

96
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,650
So, we integrate overall
possible lectures.

97
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,060
And an integral over the angles but
nothing depend on the angles.

98
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,220
So this integral will simply give us 2 pi.

99
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:03,660
And, so in 3D we can do the same thing so
in the dimension we can do this procedure,

100
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,550
we can sort of integrate
over the angles and

101
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:10,980
just separate the integral
over the magnitude of k.

102
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:16,160
So let me write therefore my self
consistency equation in these four.

103
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,050
I'll write it in any dimensions.

104
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:25,520
Alpha s sub d minus 1,
which I will explain what I mean by that.

105
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,035
2 pi to the power of D,
so in here I'm going

106
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:35,938
to write it as dk k to
the power of D minus

107
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:41,150
one a squared k squared over 2m plus ie so

108
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,595
this s of d minus one is the integral

109
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:49,918
that comes out of the end though.

110
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,117
So let's say in two dimensions
it will be simply two pi, okay?

111
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:59,015
So I wrote it in this form because
it actually corresponds sort of to

112
00:07:59,015 --> 00:08:01,467
a d minus 1 dimensional sphere.

113
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,861
So in this case, in two dimensions,

114
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:08,733
it would be basically integrating
over the circle, in three dimensions,

115
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:13,605
we'll be integrating over the solid
angles that cover the entire sphere so

116
00:08:13,605 --> 00:08:18,550
let's say s1 is equal to 2 phi which we
found out so s2 is going to be equal to 4

117
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,700
phi, well we can formally introduce
as 0 which is just 2 etc.

118
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,371
So in any dimension,
you can principle calculate it.

119
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:30,349
But for practical purposes, we don't
really need to know anything about

120
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:35,164
these three numbers because in real life,
we don't deal with anything

121
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:39,310
about three dimensions,
two dimensions or one dimension.

122
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:45,505
Now, the problem that we have is that the
theory here is already in two dimensions,

123
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:49,577
when we integrate,
let's say from 0 to infinity, so

124
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:53,710
the integral was actually
divergent at large keys.

125
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,750
So let's say if d is equal to 2 and
especially d is equal to 3.

126
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,266
So the higher we go, the more divergent
it becomes as we go to larger key.

127
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:04,670
So this integral is
actually equal to infinity.

128
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,200
So if we look at it, without thinking.

129
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,860
And well, when there is an infinity, so
we have to think about why it appears.

130
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,319
So remember that actually
this constant alpha came out.

131
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:21,250
Well, we're solving essentially
the problem for a delta potential.

132
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,530
So our V of R is alpha
times delta of r and

133
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,890
delta function, the delta function
is a very artificial function.

134
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:34,920
Was basically introduced to model a show
of potential, a physical potential that

135
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,960
has, so
it has a certain width which equals a and

136
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,170
it has a certain depth, so
which means which will equal you know it.

137
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,806
So and alpha is of the order of
u naught e to the power of d or

138
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,987
d is the dimensionality of our space.

139
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:58,507
But in any case, so this delta
function potential is introduced to

140
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:02,624
represent real physical potential
that exists in reality,

141
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:06,690
which has actually a finite width and
finite depth.

142
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,560
So when we go to large wave vectors,

143
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,890
actually the large wave vectors
respond to small distances.

144
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:20,280
And if we consider, and if we encounter
a divergence at large K, which we do here.

145
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,784
So it means that something bad
happens at small distances.

146
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:29,125
And so this something bad means that well,

147
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,910
there are no real delta
potentials in nature.

148
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,869
Okay, so,
all potentials that have a finite radius.

149
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,965
And so we can cutoff this, in some sense,

150
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:44,393
in physical diversions by
introducing a parameter 1 / E.

151
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:48,473
Where E is the radius of far of real
physical potential that we model with

152
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,240
the delta potential.

153
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,930
So this is actually a solution
to this otherwise puzzle.

154
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,060
Otherwise we will get an infinity.

155
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,980
We shouldn't get an infinity.

156
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,287
So, basically what I'm saying here is
that, even if we were to put a real

157
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:03,111
potential in the very beginning and
do everything properly,

158
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:06,398
then this cutoff would appear actually
naturally in our calculation.

159
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,593
So, but here we just introduce it by hand.

160
00:11:08,593 --> 00:11:13,068
So now we're entering a final
part of our derivation where

161
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:16,550
we will rely on the integral
we just derived.

162
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,710
So here there are no more angular
components of the wave vector,

163
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,370
there is just one integral involved.

164
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,480
And we cut it off at the 1 over E.

165
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,670
So and also, modified it a little bit so

166
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,440
there's 1 over alpha,
it's not a, it's alpha.

167
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,600
It's the strength of the potential
in the left hand side.

168
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,420
So again, the main question we've been

169
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,120
actually asking is whether there is
a bound state in a weak potential.

170
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,640
That is the potential
where alpha goes to 0, and

171
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,980
therefore, if alpha goes to 0, one,
1 over alpha goes to infinity.

172
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,090
And so the question that we
are now asking is whether we can

173
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,600
find a solution to this equation when
the left hand side is very large.

174
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,530
So you may ask me, you just got three
in infinity so, what are you doing?

175
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:06,700
This is really would be reasonable
question to say from a mathematician.

176
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,310
But, this calculation actually
illustrates, in a very nice way,

177
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,360
the difference between doing mathematical
calculations in physics and math.

178
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,420
So, the definition I just got in
read off was an unphysical infinity.

179
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,070
It's not real.

180
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,000
It was sort of an artifact of our modem.

181
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,260
And also this infinity was not
dependent on the energy so whether or

182
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,160
not we put energy to 0 or

183
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,760
to or something finite, this so-called
ultraviolet divergence would have existed.

184
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,151
And so we got it off,
we remembered where things came from and

185
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:39,970
are got rid of this divergence.

186
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,751
Now the question is whether we can have
an arbitrarily large integral by adjusting

187
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,630
the value of the energy, okay?

188
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,872
And so here is basically this integral so
I don't write here,

189
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:54,720
this overall coefficient
because it's just a number.

190
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,640
It cannot be made large or
small it's just a number.

191
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,697
2D is 1 over 2 phi and 3D is 1 over 2pi
squared so it has, it's not important.

192
00:13:02,697 --> 00:13:05,889
So, how do I answer this question?

193
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,499
So if we look at it, we see that
the absolute value of energy appears in

194
00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:13,490
the denominator, so the larger
the energy the smaller this integral.

195
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,589
It's a very clear-cut tendency.

196
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:21,920
So, the integral is the largest
when energy is equal to 0.

197
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,600
So therefore, the question we're
really asking is whether we can,

198
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,250
if we set this energy to 0 and
the remainder integral would be a key to

199
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,690
D minus 1 divided by E squared,
or simply this.

200
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,610
So the question we're asking whether
the integral below can diverge.

201
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,990
So we got rid of diversions
in the previous slide.

202
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,560
In this slide,
we're asking whether we can get it back.

203
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,990
But the important thing here is we want to
get it back not from a large momenta but

204
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,615
from a small momenta,
the latter is called infrared diversions.

205
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:53,748
And in physics, for

206
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:57,746
those of you will be thinking about
becoming theoretical physicists,

207
00:13:57,746 --> 00:14:02,541
you may remember that infrared divergence
is if you find something like that, well,

208
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:07,355
either you made the mistake or if it's
new, you should think about Nobel Prize.

209
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,465
So it's very important.

210
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:11,480
Infrared divergences are real
unlike ultraviolet divergence

211
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,440
which are sort of artificial.

212
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,740
And this boils down
basically to this question.

213
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,320
Now clearly, if let's say,
D is equal to 3,

214
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:26,030
so the dimension of space is equal to 3,
the space in which we live, so

215
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,330
then we simply have integral from 0
to 1/a or in this case It's finite.

216
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,010
There's no diversions.

217
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:35,584
And therefore, the answer to the question
is the question of existence of

218
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:39,900
the bound state is that in 3D,
there is no bound state, okay?

219
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,120
So if alpha is sufficiently small,
the right-hand side cannot possibly

220
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,401
compete with the large value
in the left-hand side.

221
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,790
But if we go to lower dimension and

222
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,050
among the reasonable dimensions,
two comes to mind.

223
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,840
So, unless we consider some fractals or
whatever,

224
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,840
so that's the only thing we can have,
1 and 2.

225
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:05,645
So in two dimensions, this integral
becomes an integral from 0 to 1/a, dk / k.

226
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:10,048
And we get a very weak sort
of logarithmic divergence so

227
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:16,180
the lower limit we're going to get 1
over 0 and it's equal to infinity.

228
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,520
So the integral divergence.

229
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,790
Which is great,
which means we have a bound state.

230
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,255
So this is really the summary
of what we learn from simply

231
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:30,207
considering this integral to
which we simplify our problem.

232
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:35,366
So, if our dimensionality is smaller or
equal to 2, so the integral diversion

233
00:15:35,366 --> 00:15:40,040
are physically it means that there
exist always exist a bound state.

234
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,240
Does metric how we could traction this.

235
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,750
So, otherwise the integral is finite and
their no bound state.

236
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,240
So, even though there is a well,
there's nothing in there.

237
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,506
There's nothing in this well.

238
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:54,298
So the last thing I'm going to do is that,
I will estimate the value of the energy or

239
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:56,456
the bounds State in two dimensions.

240
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,784
So we just found there is one.

241
00:15:57,784 --> 00:15:59,214
So let's estimate this energy.

242
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:02,596
And of course for this I have to solve
this equation specifically into g.

243
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:04,450
So let me do so.

244
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,990
Let me just calculate this integral,
actually estimate this integral.

245
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,506
I can of course calculate exactly but
let me estimate it.

246
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:13,710
It's easier, so in the first thing I'm
going to do I'm going to factor out this

247
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,650
coefficient here in front of the integral.

248
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,566
I'm going to have m over pi h squared.

249
00:16:18,566 --> 00:16:23,853
So I will get an integral
from 0 to 1 over a and

250
00:16:23,853 --> 00:16:28,722
let me write it in this form,
dk times k and

251
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:33,038
so here I'm going to have k squared plus

252
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:37,660
square root of 2me over each squared.

253
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,360
So just throw it in this form
you will understand why.

254
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,500
So if I set energy to zero I have
the logarithmic diversions which

255
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,800
as we know allows me,
allows the existence of the bound state.

256
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,900
Now but if it's finite, so
this divergence disappears so

257
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,800
the smaller it is
the larger the divergence.

258
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,020
Now to estimate the value of the integral
I can simply move this sort of cut off

259
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,540
of this divergence from the denominator
to the lower limit of the degree.

260
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,888
This method is called, well a symptomatic
method is called a very big accuracy.

261
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:19,020
So if we have integrals of this type
with divergence if we don't want to

262
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,606
perform exact calculations
sometimes it's not possible.

263
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:27,447
So one can just do this trick and
this provides a reasonable estimate.

264
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:33,144
So if we do that, so
what we're going to get is approximately,

265
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:38,617
let me write it this way,
approximately m over pi e squared

266
00:17:38,617 --> 00:17:43,330
integral now from this 2 me,
a squared 1 over e.

267
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,430
And so here I will have simply dk over k
and so this, of course, is lower, and so

268
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:54,280
the result is that m over pi H squared,
log of 1 over e,

269
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:00,280
the upper limit times h over 2m(e),
the lower limit.

270
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,890
And so now I'm in a position to find
the energy, so I can simply solve

271
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,610
this equation for e by exponentiating
both sides of these equation,

272
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,090
which gets it free of the logarithm.

273
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,310
And so the result is going to be, so the
energy of the absolute value of the energy

274
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:21,570
is going to be, let me write of
the order of a squared over ma squared,

275
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:27,145
exponential of 2 pi h squared

276
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:32,090
divided by alpha with a minus a sign.

277
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:38,270
So this is really the final result and
the result is very interesting.

278
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,060
So for a theoretical physicist at least,

279
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,300
because the function that we
got is a very strange function.

280
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,440
So remember that this parameter alpha
controls the strength of the potential.

281
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,490
And, we consider the case
when it's very small.

282
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,730
So, e to the power minus 1 over
alpha is really exponentially small,

283
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,400
very shallow level in
already a shallow potential.

284
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,760
But the function is strange because,
well if you write it, e to the power minus

285
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,350
something over alpha, so this function
does not have a Taylor expansion.

286
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,046
So remember that if we have a function,

287
00:19:16,046 --> 00:19:20,078
if an alpha normally, it's small alpha,

288
00:19:20,078 --> 00:19:25,006
we can approximate it by f
of 0 plus f prime of 0 times

289
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:30,054
alpha plus f 2 prime sub 0
over 2 of a squared, etc.

290
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:32,846
So this is a regular Taylor
expansion of a function.

291
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:35,628
So in this case, all of the derivatives,

292
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:40,240
all the terms in this Taylor
expansion are equal to zero.

293
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,260
And this actually would have posed
a problem if we had tried to solve this

294
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,670
problem using so-called preservation
theory which physicists love because

295
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:57,080
oftentimes gives us access to solutions
that are otherwise impossible to get.

296
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,170
So we start with a known solution,

297
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,890
then do a Taylor expansion in
the vicinity of the solution.

298
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:06,790
So here it wouldn't have been possible,
exactly because of these weird properties.

299
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,210
The function exists, we can plot it,
we can look at it, but

300
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,539
there is no Taylor expansion at all.

301
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,840
So and it turns out that in
the second lecture this week we're

302
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,860
going to study some basics about
the theory of superconductivity and

303
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:26,730
there's a classic formula in these Nobel
Prize winning Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer

304
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,220
theory of superconductivity which features
this function, this sort of function.

305
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,250
Actually, the reason it took people, as I
will talk about it in the next lecture,

306
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,570
the reason it took people almost 50 years
to come up with a solution to the problem

307
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,970
superconductivity is partially
because of this circumstance.

308
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,060
That the result actually is something that

309
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,680
can only be obtained by an exact
nonperturbative calculation.

310
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,880
But it couldn't be obtained
using the perturbation theory.
