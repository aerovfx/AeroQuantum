00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.620
Welcome back everybody and

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.920
this week we're going to go back to
more traditional quantum mechanics,

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.580
that is quantum mechanics described
in terms of the Schrodinger equation.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.780
And today I'm going to solve
the Schrodinger equation

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.450
on a number of very important examples,
where we'll show you how quantum

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.220
potentials can capture quantum particles
that result in so called bound states.

7
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.150
So even though the solutions that we're
going to see, the examples we're going to

8
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.180
see are rather elementary from
the quantum mechanical point of view.

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.920
Well, otherwise,
they will require some thinking.

10
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.980
So these examples are going to give us
insight into some rather complicated and

11
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.220
fascinating problems such as for
instance, theory of superconductivity.

12
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.780
So in the end of the lecture today,
we're going to discuss our solutions

13
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.060
are relevant to the key phenomenon that is

14
00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.420
responsible for super conductivity
that is so called Cooper pairs.

15
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.740
But before we get to this point
we need to go over the basics.

16
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.890
And so let me start first with
the problem of electron in a box.

17
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.520
I will define it in a second.

18
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.250
But even before that let me just talk
about what kinds of problems we want to,

19
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.760
we can't possibly study with
the Schrodinger Equation.

20
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.690
So here is a canonical
Schrodinger equation.

21
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.910
We have seen it already many times.

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.760
It's a time dependent
Schrodinger equation.

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.570
As we will see later, today, so actually
if the potential does not depend on time,

24
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.580
there is really no need to start
a time dependent Schrodinger equation.

25
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.129
So as we'll see, it can be transformed
into an eigenvalue problem for

26
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:43.340
the [INAUDIBLE] that we
will actually solve.

27
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.300
And in any case, so this first term in
the single particle mechanics anyways.

28
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.720
So this first drum on this Hamiltonian
is just the kinetic energy.

29
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.398
There is essentially,
it's a non-negotiable term.

30
00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:58.980
The second term is something which
is sort of problem dependent which

31
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.260
determines the potential in which
our quantum particle moves.

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.000
So amazingly the variety of all
possible problems in single

33
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.675
particle quantum mechanics are contained
in this equation in a compact,

34
00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:18.665
and they differ simply
by the choice of V of R.

35
00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:23.265
But this compactness of
basically quantum mechanics

36
00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:27.790
is a bit deceptive because it can give
you the impression that it can just solve

37
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.550
all possible quantum mechanical problems
in one go, just by solving this equation.

38
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.800
Well, this equation is
very rich equation and

39
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.630
depending on the choice of V(r) of
the potential at which the particle moves,

40
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.280
we can get completely
different physical situations.

41
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.120
And understanding these physical
situations would require,

42
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.600
dramatically different
mathematical approaches too.

43
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.980
However, very roughly,

44
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.970
what we can do, we can classify our
quantum potential by putting it in one

45
00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.340
of two categories of either
an attractive or a repulsive potential.

46
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.230
Which, in the context of quantum physics,
the former are called potential wells and

47
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.920
the latter are called potential barriers.

48
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.300
So here let me present,

49
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.210
well sort of simple illustration of what
a typical potential well looks like.

50
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.020
So this is v of x.

51
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.800
It's in 1D quantum mechanics and
this is a 1D coordinate and

52
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.130
potential barrier would like
sort of opposite to it.

53
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.245
It would look like a hill.

54
00:03:26.245 --> 00:03:29.890
And today,

55
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.680
we're going to focus our attention on
the physics of quantum potential wells.

56
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.428
Basically to give you the result
right from the onset,

57
00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:42.750
I think most of you
probably already know this.

58
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.890
In potential wells, we're going to see
that the available energy levels for

59
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.400
the particle to occupy
With a negative energy.

60
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.250
So they're going to be quantized, that is,
the particle wouldn't be able to have any

61
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.270
arbitrary energy just like in classical
physics, where we could assign any energy.

62
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.410
We could put, let's say,
a ball at any level and

63
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.700
let it oscillate between
the turning points.

64
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.360
In quantum mechanics, let's say if we got
an electron in a potential well with this

65
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.990
landscape, we cannot assign
it an arbitrary energy.

66
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.330
So the available energies
are going to be quantized.

67
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.840
And finding these quantized
energy levels is one of the sort

68
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.250
of canonical problems that
we're going to solve.

69
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.100
But this business about finding the
quantized energy levels in an arbitrary

70
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.260
quantum well is in principle rather
complicated technically, and

71
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.830
the complexity of this exercise really

72
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.910
depends on the particular form
of the potential we're studying.

73
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.810
However, to see the appearance of these
quantum levels, in general we can focus on

74
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.600
the simplest examples of your facts and
that's what we're going to do now.

75
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.240
And perhaps the very simplest
example Is a potential which has so

76
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.270
called hard wall boundaries
which implies the falling.

77
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.360
So it basically means a potential
were beyond certain points.

78
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.730
Let's say x equals zero.

79
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.720
And x equals l.

80
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.590
So the value of the potential,
the effects is equal to infinity.

81
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.150
So there is no way the particle
can move beyond this point.

82
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.090
These are infinite walls.

83
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.380
And in between these two points, the value
of the potential is exactly equal to zero.

84
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.610
So which means that the particle's sort of
free to move between these two walls, but

85
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.570
it cannot go outside.

86
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.470
And this is what is known as
the problem of an electron in the box.

87
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.780
So as you probably can guess, the solution
of this problem you're going to complete

88
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.420
in the remainder of this segment
is going to involve certain

89
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.950
energy levels which are going to
form a discrete series.

90
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.570
So, it turns out that to understand
the phenomenon of quantization,

91
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.970
one does really need
quantum mechanics at all.

92
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.500
The quantization occur is in
classical physics all over the place.

93
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.940
And so here for instance, we have
an example of a very familiar object,

94
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.680
a guitar, which relies on quantization
in some sense of the wave lengths and

95
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.220
frequencies available in
its oscillating strings.

96
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.520
So here we have strings which are free to

97
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.430
oscillate between two points
where they're pinned down.

98
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.970
And those two points in

99
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.490
some sense correspond to the hard wall
boundaries in the corresponding quantum

100
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.659
mechanical problem that we're
going to study a little later.

101
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.928
The available wavelengths much depend
on the distance between these points,

102
00:06:37.928 --> 00:06:40.260
these hard walls let's call it.

103
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:45.251
And the frequencies are related
to the available wavelengths by

104
00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:47.620
the speed of sound.

105
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.420
Let's now think about,
what is the longest possible wavelength?

106
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.750
That we can induce in a finite string.

107
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.130
So these are basically
our hard walls again.

108
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.340
So this is our 0 and this is our L and
the hard walls in this

109
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:06.570
context essentially mean that
the strings cannot oscillate here.

110
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:12.570
So the displacement, let's call it u,
from this horizontal axis is exactly zero.

111
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.680
X equals zero and X equals L.

112
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:23.220
In other words, so,
we must have notes at these end points.

113
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:30.590
And the longest possible wave length
that achieves that is lambda equals 2L.

114
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.860
And this is sort of
the fundamental oscillation,

115
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.820
the longest possible wavelength
that we can induce on this string.

116
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.310
Because if we try to make this wavelength
even longer, it would imply essential that

117
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.990
we would have either no note in this
point or no note in this point.

118
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.630
And this will violate our boundary.

119
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.430
But there are of course many more wave
lengths that are possible that would

120
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.250
satisfy the proper boundary conditions and
we can achieve we can sort

121
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.550
of find these additional wave lengths or
higher harmonics as they're called

122
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:07.290
by putting additional nodes
in between these end points.

123
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:12.210
And so for instance this
example gives us a wavelength

124
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:17.620
which is exactly equal to the L to
the distance between the n points.

125
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.280
And we can continue this procedure and
generate many more wavelengths.

126
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:26.240
And these wavelengths are going to
follow this quantization rule if

127
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.160
you want with the corresponding solution,

128
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:37.310
while if you look at the snapshot of
an oscillating string at a certain time.

129
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.965
So the solution is simply going to
be given by the sin, well,

130
00:08:40.965 --> 00:08:43.960
some amplitude which is
not really important.

131
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.333
Sin of 2 pi x over lambda sub n, and
of course, if x is equal to zero,

132
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:51.363
we're going to have the boundary, we're
going to satisfy the boundary condition,

133
00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:52.660
x equals zero.

134
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.780
And if x is going to be equal to L,

135
00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.210
this quantization rule is going to enforce
the other boundary conditions, namely that

136
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:06.740
the displacement vanishes at sequence L,
where we have a node here.

137
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:11.160
Now if we look at the corresponding
quantum mechanical problem.

138
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.490
So it essentially is very similar to
the problem of this oscillating string.

139
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:20.400
With the only difference being that
instead of putting an elastic string

140
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.870
between the two points, we put an electron
wave in between these two points.

141
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.110
But the wavelengths that are available for
the electrons, so

142
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.610
the electron cannot really move beyond
this hard wall rules right where

143
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.240
the probability of finding
the electron there is equal to zero.

144
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.090
Therefore, we must demand that,
well the probability of psi-squared

145
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:46.540
of x=0 and
L is identically equal to zero, Okay?

146
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:49.340
So, or
in other words psi itself is equal 0 and

147
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:54.610
this is much similar to having a node
at the endpoints of this string.

148
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.900
So if we solve this problem for
the electron, well,

149
00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.230
which will involve in this case actually
solving the Schroedinger equation,

150
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.160
we're going to find exactly
the same wavelength.

151
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.860
And the wave function is actually
going to look exactly the same

152
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.760
as the displacement of the string.

153
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.180
So, there's absolutely no difference.

154
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:17.120
I just copy and pasted it exactly the same
equations, so only replacing u sub n

155
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.470
which is a displacement by psi of n which
is the wave function of the electron.

156
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.190
So this shows you that actually there is a
lot of analogy in quantization of electron

157
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:31.172
wave lengths and quantization of
wave length of classic objects,

158
00:10:31.172 --> 00:10:32.860
elastic objects.

159
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.770
So the only difference, and an important
difference here, would be in how

160
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.740
the frequency, or the energy in the case
of electron, scale with the wavelength.

161
00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.490
So here we discuss that the frequency
of the oscillation, which by the way

162
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:50.800
determines the sound that we actually
hear, scales linearly with the wavelength.

163
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.390
On the other hand we know that
the energy of the quantum particle of

164
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.470
just well kinetic energy is essentially a
free particle moving in between these two

165
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.500
points is going to be
p squared over 2n and

166
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:10.080
if we recall the de Broile
relation between the momentum and

167
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.850
the wave length which is 2 pi h
bar over lambda is equal to p.

168
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.950
So then we can regularly combine these two
results of the quantization of the wave

169
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.890
length and the scaling of the energy
to get the quantization of energy.

170
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.300
So if you put everything together
it is quantization rule and

171
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.930
the de Broglie relation we're going to
get the quantized energy levels,

172
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:39.170
e sub n where n is a positive
integer equal to pi squared,

173
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:45.190
h squared, n squared divided by
the l squared, the distance here

174
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.720
that corresponds to the momentum
squared times 1 over twice the mass.

175
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.740
So, in August, that interestingly
we solved the Schrodinger equation

176
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.940
without writing it down.

177
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.177
The only thing we used, is basically
was the boundary conditions, and

178
00:12:02.177 --> 00:12:07.000
same analogy with classical physics,
along with the de Brogile relation.

179
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.039
But of course, one can solve it formally
and we'll show later how it works.

180
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:16.690
So, sadly one can not always
solve the string equation in

181
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:19.770
a simplistic way without writing it down.

182
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.890
So to understand why it happens we can

183
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.010
again use this guitar
sort of string analogy.

184
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.820
So if we push down on the string, so

185
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.910
we effectively shorten the distance
between this ends points and

186
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.890
the effective end points here and by doing
so we of course change the fundamental

187
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:44.050
wavelength and the quantization of
the wavelength and the frequencies.

188
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:49.940
This sort of results in different
sounds that we, produce this way.

189
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.160
But if we push not very hard, but

190
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.140
if we just touch the string here, so
this creates in sort of an infinite wall,

191
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.720
impenetrable wall for
the string to propagate.

192
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.870
Beyond this point,
it creates a finite barrier.

193
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.520
And to solve the wave equation,
for this string,

194
00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.520
the classical wave equation in
the presence of such a small perturbation

195
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.640
is actually more complicated then solving
this equation for two hard walls.

196
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.390
And likewise, we're going to see actually
that the problem of a quantum mechanical

197
00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:25.500
particle, when instead of the hard walls
we have let's say finite barrier here is

198
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:31.200
more complicated and it requires actually
a serious mathematical calculations

199
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.340
in solving the actual Schroedinger
equation which is a differential equation.

200
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.890
We're going to discuss in
the following segment.
