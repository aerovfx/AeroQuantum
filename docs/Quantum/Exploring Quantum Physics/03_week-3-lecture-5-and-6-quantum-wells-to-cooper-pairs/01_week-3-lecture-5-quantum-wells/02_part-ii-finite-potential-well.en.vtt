1
00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:05.327
In the previous segment, we saw that
the Schrodinger equation for an infinite

2
00:00:05.327 --> 00:00:09.796
potential, well, without even writing
down the Schrodinger equation itself.

3
00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:12.736
So, of course,
it doesn't always happen this way so for

4
00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:16.597
a more complicated potentials we actually
have to do some calculations and

5
00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:20.761
in this segment I'm going to present
an example of a general method, actually,

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.335
that is used to solve
the Schrödinger equation and

7
00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:25.942
I would consider a so-called
finite potential.

8
00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:31.779
Well, so the potential that we're actually
going to study is illustrated here,

9
00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.786
so here is a formal sort of
mathematical expression for

10
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:39.640
this potential and
this is the, its illustration.

11
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.818
So for x, so
this is one dimensional potential for

12
00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:47.700
x greater than a/2 or smaller than- a/2,

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.474
we have a finite wall if you
want with a height of u naught,

14
00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:57.474
and in between- a/2 and a/2,
we have potential well.

15
00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.968
And so the question that we're going to
be interested in is whether or

16
00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:06.785
not we have energy levels,
allowed states within the potential well,

17
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:12.242
which implies that the energy of these
states must be smaller than this maximum,

18
00:01:12.242 --> 00:01:14.356
u naught, but larger than 0.

19
00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:19.448
So these are positive energies
here in this formulation.

20
00:01:19.448 --> 00:01:23.800
Now, clearly we have three regions
that appear in this potential.

21
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.860
So one region will be to
the left of the point,- a/2.

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.598
The second region, which is the potential
well itself, will be between -a/2 and

23
00:01:32.598 --> 00:01:36.870
a/2 and the third region is x>a/2.

24
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.400
And for each of the regions,
we can write down the corresponding

25
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.333
Schrödinger equation, let's say,
for regions the 1 and 3 for

26
00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:52.600
absolute x>a/2 we have the kinetic
energy + the potential energy U

27
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.510
naught = energy that we're actually
looking for, E times psi (x).

28
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.140
And for the region of the potential,
well, we'll formally

29
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.120
have just the free Schrodinger equation,
since the potential here is equal to zero.

30
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.660
Now, to solve this Schrodinger equation,

31
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.190
the main challenge in some sense of
solving the Schrodinger equation

32
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.600
is actually would be to match
the solutions in different regions.

33
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.460
And by match, I mean the following.

34
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.375
We are going to demand that both
the wave function itself and

35
00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:31.613
its first derivative
are continuous everywhere.

36
00:02:31.613 --> 00:02:35.198
In particular in these matching points,
-a/2 and

37
00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:38.872
a/2, and so
here I've formally represented as so.

38
00:02:38.872 --> 00:02:42.698
So +0 basically means to
the right of a certain point and

39
00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:46.250
-0 means to the left of a certain point.

40
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.550
And the reason we want our wave function
or let's say is derivative to be

41
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.638
continues, is because if we do not have
this continuity, let's say in this point,

42
00:02:55.638 --> 00:03:00.224
if we let's say solve our Schrodinger
equation in region three and in region

43
00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:05.026
two, and depending I don't bother to
measure them, then in general so our wave

44
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:09.750
function, in this case, is going to
be something like this, let's say.

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.340
And there will be a jump, a final jump in
the wave function or in this derivative.

46
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.880
And if we calculate the second derivative,
here,

47
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.780
due to the jump, we're going to
have an infinite second derivative,

48
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.590
which wouldn't be able to compensate
in our Schrödinger equation.

49
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.020
So there will be essentially a delta
function coming up from this

50
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.750
discontinuity, and, well,
we don't have it in our problem.

51
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.880
In our problem,
we don't have a delta function.

52
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.340
So therefore,
we must demand that the wave function and

53
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.940
its derivatives are continuous everywhere.

54
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.670
And it turns out that this,
along with this condition, would be

55
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.935
enough to find the constraints which
will determine the actual energy levels.

56
00:03:55.935 --> 00:04:00.680
So, now the electric constraint,
namely that the wave function should decay

57
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.640
at infinity is essentially
physically meaningful constraint,

58
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.840
so we were looking for
bound state of our particle.

59
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.796
So we want the probability of finding
this particle at infinity to be 0.

60
00:04:15.796 --> 00:04:20.553
And we want the probability to be
sort of localized in the vicinity of

61
00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:25.985
the potential well and so this is where
the second constraint is coming from.

62
00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:31.919
Now to simplify this equation,
we could just notice that,

63
00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.834
well, we can rewrite it, let's say,

64
00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:41.411
the first one we can introduce
a new parameter, gamma,

65
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:47.486
which is 2m over h squared,
(U naught- epsilon,- E).

66
00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:48.867
And so
let me actually call it gamma squared.

67
00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:54.818
And well, we can just put the energy
in the left-hand side and

68
00:04:54.818 --> 00:04:59.397
multiply everything by -2m/h squared, and

69
00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:04.090
this would give rise to
the following equation,

70
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.653
psi 2 primes- gamma squared = 0.

71
00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:10.362
So the second equation,

72
00:05:10.362 --> 00:05:15.651
we can introduce a parameter,
let's say, k and

73
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:21.985
we are going to have this with
psi + k square root of psi = 0.

74
00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:24.705
So let me just rewrite it
in a slightly nicer way.

75
00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:27.344
So here are the basically the two
equations I just wrote, and

76
00:05:27.344 --> 00:05:28.945
here are the parameters.

77
00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.395
Both these equations, actually,
very simple equations.

78
00:05:31.395 --> 00:05:36.915
So this one has a solutions,
either the power plus, minus gamma x.

79
00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:41.070
You can just plug it in and see
the the derivative of the exponential and

80
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.130
the exponential is
the exponential itself and,

81
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.880
well, clearly is going to
satisfy this equation.

82
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.340
And the second equation, well,
is just the three Schrodinger equation,

83
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.220
unsurprisingly, gives us just
plain waves as the solution,

84
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.550
either applying plus minus pi K times x.

85
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.200
So and again, the challenge is going to
be to match those guys in each of these

86
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.310
points, -a/2 and a/2.

87
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.703
Now it's not really necessary for
the solution of the problem, but

88
00:06:07.703 --> 00:06:11.324
I would like to use the symmetry
of the problem here, and

89
00:06:11.324 --> 00:06:16.256
this would give me an excuse in some
sense to introduce the symmetry concepts

90
00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:19.438
in quantum mechanics in
a much broader context.

91
00:06:19.438 --> 00:06:24.145
So namely, I would like to
point out the following fact.

92
00:06:24.145 --> 00:06:30.090
If the Hamiltonian commutes with an
operator, A, this can be an operator for

93
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.852
any physical quantity, then the solutions
to the Schrodinger equation,

94
00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:42.330
that is, an equation which is
an eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian.

95
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.480
So then these solutions can also be
chosen to have definite value of E,

96
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.180
which means that the same solutions
are going to be the eigenstates

97
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.840
of the eigenvalue problem for
this operator A, whatever it is.

98
00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.090
So in general, if the two operators were
not to commute, so I wouldn't necessarily

99
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.980
have been able to find such a set of wave

100
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.080
function which would have both A and
E, the energy, definite.

101
00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.379
So but in the presence of such a symmetry,
if you want this possibility exists.

102
00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:20.037
Now what does this have
to do with our problem?

103
00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:24.167
So in our problem, we have a sort
of rather obvious symmetry which

104
00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:27.710
is essentially inversion
symmetry of the potentials.

105
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:33.250
If we flip x, x goes to- x, so
the potential is unchanged.

106
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.287
And so
the kinetic energy also doesn't change, so

107
00:07:36.287 --> 00:07:39.263
it's just a second derivative
with respect to x.

108
00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:42.929
So therefore the Hamiltonian,
one can check,

109
00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:48.991
that the Hamiltonian is indeed symmetric
or invariant under this operation.

110
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:53.190
And so operator that actually enforces
this inversion is this operator,

111
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.726
I, which basically takes x to minus x,
and this operator has two eigenvalues,

112
00:07:57.726 --> 00:08:00.660
the parities,
which are either plus or minus one.

113
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.710
So, the functions which are eigenfunctions
of this inversion operator

114
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.428
are either even or
odd function of the coordinate.

115
00:08:09.428 --> 00:08:15.410
And so, what are saying in this very
complicated language is that we can

116
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:21.010
find the Eigen states of our problem,
the solution to the Schrodinger equation,

117
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.640
which would be either odd or
even functions.

118
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.150
That's all we're saying and, well, another
statement that I would like to make is

119
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.750
that if there is a symmetry in
the problem, you better use it.

120
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.290
So, it always simplifies things and
never it makes things more complicated.

121
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.300
It always simplifies things.

122
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.020
And so
that's what I'm going to do here as well.

123
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.460
So in general,
if I were to ignore this symmetry, so

124
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.820
the solution to the Schrodinger
equations we just discussed in this

125
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:49.129
region of the well would be an arbitrary
linear combination of two plane waves.

126
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.775
Now I'm saying, so since there is this
symmetry in the problem, so I would like,

127
00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:58.396
instead of just having this
arbitrary coefficient C1 and C2,

128
00:08:58.396 --> 00:09:02.372
I would like to consider separately
solutions with definite parity.

129
00:09:02.372 --> 00:09:08.230
Either even functions,
which is basically cosine with C1 = C2 or

130
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:13.365
a sine, which is an odd function,
in which case C1 is equal

131
00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:19.148
to a complex conjugate and
these are purely measuring constants.

132
00:09:19.148 --> 00:09:20.399
So in the following,

133
00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:24.776
I'm going to specifically consider
focus on this even solution, just for

134
00:09:24.776 --> 00:09:29.028
simplicity, but you can find the general
analysis in a number of books.

135
00:09:29.028 --> 00:09:32.860
So this is the problem we are solving by
the way is absolutely classical problem.

136
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.840
Classical not in the sense of classical
physics, but in the sense that it appears

137
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:42.430
in just about every course or
every book on quantum physics.

138
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.940
Now, having determined the solution
we're interested in in region two,

139
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.370
we now have to determine
the solutions in regions one and

140
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.850
three that we're going to be focusing on.

141
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.840
And by the way,
the symmetry of the problem,

142
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.940
we can actually pick just
one of these regions.

143
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.260
So we don't really have to use in
this case both matching points.

144
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.550
We can do, well, just using one point.

145
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.586
And as we discussed, the general
solution to the Schrodinger equation,

146
00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:14.480
to this equation, in the region three
is given by a linear combination of

147
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.980
these two exponentials, which are no
longer oscillating functions but

148
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.380
are functions that are either decaying,

149
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:27.790
a rapidly decaying function,
or a rapidly growing function.

150
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:32.298
And so, to simplify, to find the proper
solution in the region three,

151
00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:37.031
let's say, for R > a/2, we have to
recall the constraint at infinity,

152
00:10:37.031 --> 00:10:40.288
namely that the wave
function must remain finite.

153
00:10:40.288 --> 00:10:41.996
Well, actually, I should correct it.

154
00:10:41.996 --> 00:10:47.070
It should actually go to
0 as we go to infinity.

155
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.763
So otherwise if we don't impose this
constraint, if we allow in this case this

156
00:10:51.763 --> 00:10:56.525
term in the wave function, the probability
of a particle to leak in some sense to

157
00:10:56.525 --> 00:11:00.962
infinity would explode exponentially,
which doesn't make any sense.

158
00:11:00.962 --> 00:11:07.098
So therefore, we simply draw up
the B term in this wave function and

159
00:11:07.098 --> 00:11:12.485
only will focus on this wave
function in the region three.

160
00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:18.740
So now we're in a position to
actually match the solutions.

161
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.460
We know the solution in each region.

162
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.340
So here I do present a solution in all
of the regions, including region one.

163
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.000
So this guy is for region one.

164
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.070
This guy is for region two.

165
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.710
And this guy is for region three.

166
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:30.460
But as I said,

167
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:35.810
the symmetry, we can focus on one matching
point and this is what I'm going to do.

168
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.960
So now we can write the wave
function to the left at this point,

169
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.740
which is going to be C
times cosine (ka/2) and

170
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.710
it must be equal to the wave function
to the right, which is this guy,

171
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:53.754
which is A e- gamma a/2.

172
00:11:53.754 --> 00:11:56.180
So this is the first matching condition.

173
00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.383
And the second matching condition is going
to be the derivative of this function.

174
00:12:00.383 --> 00:12:03.705
So the derivative of cosine is minus sine,

175
00:12:03.705 --> 00:12:07.592
so we're going to have-
c times k sine (ka/2).

176
00:12:07.592 --> 00:12:12.055
To the left, must be equal to-

177
00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:17.385
A gamma e- gamma a/2 to the right.

178
00:12:17.385 --> 00:12:21.868
And now what I'm going to do, I'm going to
divide so let me call this equation,

179
00:12:21.868 --> 00:12:25.320
equation number 2 and
this going to be equation number 1.

180
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.110
And so if we divide equation
number 2 by equation number 1,

181
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:35.120
which we're allowed to do, what we're
going to get in the left-hand side

182
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:42.350
we're going to have k times sine
over cosine is a tangent (ka/2).

183
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:45.560
And in the right-hand side, so
the minuses will go away and

184
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.250
the exponentials are going to go away,
we're going to get just gamma.

185
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.790
So here I have the same equation
written explicitly in a nicer way.

186
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.325
And also I recall the definitions of gamma
and K, that I made in a previous slide,

187
00:12:58.325 --> 00:13:02.150
so K itself is the square
root of 2mE over A squared,

188
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.590
and the energy is really
what we're looking for.

189
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:07.549
The energy appears both
in the left-hand side and

190
00:13:07.549 --> 00:13:10.586
in the right-hand side in
a rather nonlinear way.

191
00:13:10.586 --> 00:13:13.139
And as a matter of fact, there is no way,

192
00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:16.080
we cannot solve this
equation analytically.

193
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.405
So this is a nonlinear
algebraic equation and

194
00:13:19.405 --> 00:13:23.960
it doesn't have a formal
sort of closed solution in.

195
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.578
So which, by the way, is quite amazing
that the problem as simple as this finite

196
00:13:27.578 --> 00:13:30.602
potential, well, in one dimensional
quantum mechanics which,

197
00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:34.169
is just about the simplest problem you
can think of, cannot really be solved.

198
00:13:34.169 --> 00:13:38.277
So this tells you something about
the technical complexity of

199
00:13:38.277 --> 00:13:40.180
the Schrödinger equation.

200
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.740
Now, to proceed further towards a bit of
numerical analysis or asymptotic analysis,

201
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.870
it's always a good idea in such
cases to get rid of the physical,

202
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.610
dimensional quantity such as energy or
this potential height,

203
00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:01.740
which have physical dimension, and
move to dimensionless parameters.

204
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.460
And so here the nature of dimensionless
parameters are going to be, well,

205
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.820
basically the argument of this tangent,
which is ka/2 and

206
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.720
the parameter introduced here,
which is basically to be able to

207
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:21.350
write our equation in a nice and
dimensionless way.

208
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:26.510
The reason why dealing with dimensionless
quantities is much more convenient than

209
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:31.970
with quantities that has non-trivial,
physical dimensions is because for

210
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.880
the former, we can talk about
them being large or small.

211
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.360
So, we can say that something is small or
large just comparing it with one.

212
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:44.966
While, for a dimensional quantity, it does
really make sense to talk about larger.

213
00:14:44.966 --> 00:14:49.050
It's more, unless we specify what we
actually mean by that, for instance,

214
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.100
is one meter large or small?

215
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:55.050
Well, we don't know unless we compare it
with the, let's say, size of an atom,

216
00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.170
in which case it's clearly larger over
the size of universe, in which case,

217
00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.730
one meter is really small.

218
00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.810
So here, once we get this parameter psi,

219
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:09.680
it allows us to define basically
a deep and shallow potential.

220
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.144
So we will call the potential deep
if this guy, this k psi squared,

221
00:15:14.144 --> 00:15:15.977
is much larger than 1, and

222
00:15:15.977 --> 00:15:21.270
the potential is going to be called
shallow if it's much smaller than 1.

223
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:26.360
And by the way, in the following two
video segments, we're going to be

224
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:32.140
focusing on shallow potentials which
are well modeled by a delta function.

225
00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.423
So, naively, you would think that
delta function is something which is

226
00:15:36.423 --> 00:15:40.866
actually very deep because it goes to
infinity if you approach x equals 0.

227
00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:47.117
Let's say if we're talking about potential
u (x) which is, let's say,- u Delta (x).

228
00:15:47.117 --> 00:15:53.102
But, well, delta (x),
the potential of delta(x) is really,

229
00:15:53.102 --> 00:15:58.352
it means to represent potential
with a very small radius and

230
00:15:58.352 --> 00:16:05.320
the radius in order for the integral of
the Delta function to be equal to o1ne.

231
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.150
So the radius of the potential,

232
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.600
the size of the potential should scale
with the depth of the potential as so.

233
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:18.030
So as a goes to zero, well, u naught
is sort of proportional to one over a.

234
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.870
But here we see that
the definition of a shallow

235
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:28.000
potential is u naught a squared times
m over a squared must be more than 1,

236
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.210
which means that the delta potential is
actually closer to a shallow potential

237
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.630
which is an important observation
that we will take advantage later of.

238
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.170
But at this stage, let me just say that
while we have these two special cases.

239
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.990
And even though we cannot solve
exactly this equation for

240
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:48.840
a arbitrary side,
we can do two separate analysis of this

241
00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:54.280
equation in such two special cases,
and here I present these analysis.

242
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.426
So this is, again, the same equation.

243
00:16:56.426 --> 00:17:00.002
So the red tangent of x is plotted here.

244
00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:03.986
So here, basically, I plot the functions
on the left of this equation and

245
00:17:03.986 --> 00:17:06.260
on the right of this equation.

246
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:11.558
And you see, by the way,
that when x becomes larger than psi,

247
00:17:11.558 --> 00:17:16.910
so this right-hand side becomes
a purely imaginary constant,

248
00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.960
which implies that there is definitely
no solution to this equation,

249
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.260
as the tangent here does
not become imaginary.

250
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.707
So it makes sense only to plot this

251
00:17:28.707 --> 00:17:34.550
function for x as smaller than psi.

252
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:39.860
So, here I have an example of a deep
potential where I say, set psi

253
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:44.090
to 20 and so I have all these red
curves corresponding to the tangent and

254
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:49.460
this blue curve corresponds to
the right-hand side, and wherever

255
00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:56.420
I see a crossing between these two guys,
so I see here, here, here, here, etcetera.

256
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.360
So I have a level.

257
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.051
In this case, I can count the number of
levels that are allowed in this quantum.

258
00:18:02.051 --> 00:18:07.135
Well, one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven levels are allowed for

259
00:18:07.135 --> 00:18:10.321
the symmetric wave functions, if psi = 20.

260
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:14.840
Now let's consider a relatively shallow
potential that is on the other hand, so

261
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.320
let's say with psi = 1.

262
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.332
In this case, I only have to plot these
functions for x is more than 1 and

263
00:18:21.332 --> 00:18:26.097
there is just one crossing between
the blue curve and the red curve,

264
00:18:26.097 --> 00:18:31.299
which means that there is just one
single level in the shallow potential.

265
00:18:31.299 --> 00:18:35.473
Which by the way is a very important
resolve that we're going to confirm on

266
00:18:35.473 --> 00:18:38.183
the case of a one
dimensional delta potential.

267
00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:42.170
And we're going to see how this result
is more defined in higher dimensions.

268
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.124
Now the last comment I'm going to
make is that, and first of all,

269
00:18:47.124 --> 00:18:52.025
I could have continued analysis of this
self-consistency equation and there

270
00:18:52.025 --> 00:18:56.703
is a lot to do to determine the actual
numerical value of the energy levels to

271
00:18:56.703 --> 00:19:01.478
see what happens with the anti-symmetric
levels with the wave functions.

272
00:19:01.478 --> 00:19:05.992
And I'm not going to do it right now
in the lecture because admittedly it's

273
00:19:05.992 --> 00:19:10.358
probably not the most exciting thing
in quantum mechanics, so we'll

274
00:19:10.358 --> 00:19:15.100
encourage you to take a look a various
textbooks and other lectures online.

275
00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.680
For example, these set of lectures
by Professor Michael Fowler

276
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.780
at the University of Virginia.

277
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.400
In those we will see a few

278
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.130
problems of following up on
this solution in your homework.

279
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:35.850
So you will have a chance to look
into this problem in more detail and

280
00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.700
understand the solution at a deeper level.
