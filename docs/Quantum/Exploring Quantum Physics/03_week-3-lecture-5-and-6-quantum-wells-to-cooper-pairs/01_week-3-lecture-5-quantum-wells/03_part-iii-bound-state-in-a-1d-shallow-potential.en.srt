1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,840
In the previous video we saw
that the shallow quantum well

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,360
can be faithfully represented as
an attractive derived delta potential.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,200
And in this video we're going to
solve the Schrödinger equation

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,630
with a delta potential in an arbitrary
dimension, one, two or three.

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,110
And we're going to use
a very powerful method,

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,340
mathematical method, that as a matter
of fact was used by Leon Cooper,

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,870
to solve the key problem in
the theory of superconductivity and

8
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:33,300
the problem of electron pairing which
brought him eventually a Nobel Prize and

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
now this phenomenon of pairing is
actually called Cooper pairing.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,797
But we'll talk a little about this later,

11
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:42,686
but at this stage we're going to focus
on just a single particle Schrödinger

12
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:45,587
equation with this sort of
short-range attraction.

13
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,519
And so
before going through the technicalities,

14
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,586
I want to give you the bottom line,
the main result,

15
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:54,616
if you sort of get lost in
these technical details.

16
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:58,980
So, at least I'd like you to know the very
important outcome of this calculation

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,015
we're going to see.

18
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:05,058
And so the outcome would be the following,
so we'll see that in one and

19
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:09,763
two dimensions that measure how
weak attractive potential gives

20
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:12,870
rise to bound state of a quantum particle.

21
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:17,900
So, doesn't matter how shallow a well,
we have it always will bind the particle.

22
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,490
But in three dimensions, it turns out that
if you have a very weak potential, very

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,470
shallow potential, it's not enough to keep
the particle to localize the particle.

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,550
And this difference,
qualitative difference,

25
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,730
actually have a very important
consequences in various fields.

26
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,590
In physics, you may want to remember that.

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,470
But now let me go to the technical part.

28
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,906
Okay, so and I will start with
a certain math reminder which

29
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:45,150
basically will remind you
what a Fourier transform is.

30
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,540
So, we can solve the problem, but

31
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,960
we'll solve the problem using
only the Fourier transform.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,960
There will be nothing else involved
essentially this solution.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,240
Fourier transform and
inreverse Fourier transform.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,190
So, what is a Fourier transform?

35
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,960
So, if you have an arbitrary function,
well reasonable function g(x),

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,410
in our case it will be a wave function and
various derivatives of it.

37
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,900
So the Fourier transform of this function
g(x), which we call f of g(x) or

38
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,290
g tilde (k) is an integral of
g(x) with this exponential.

39
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,668
So physically this K in our case
will represent the wave and

40
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:26,663
H x K is going to be the particles
momentum but in principle you can

41
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:31,479
view this Fourier transform
as a mathematical procedure.

42
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,087
And an important fact here is that if you
know the Fourier transform function you

43
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:40,438
can restore the function itself but
doing the inverse Fourier transform.

44
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:45,413
So, g (x) is equal to an integral of,
there should be a g

45
00:02:45,413 --> 00:02:49,992
tilde (k) into the power minus ikx,
dk over 2 Pi.

46
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:53,287
So, I remind you or
emphasize that where to put this,

47
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:57,972
2 Pi is actually a matter of convention or
convenience, so we could have put

48
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:02,810
the 2 Pi in the [INAUDIBLE] transform or
we could have separated them.

49
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,330
Sort of like this, so we could have
put 1 over square root of 2 Pi here,

50
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,250
1 over square root of 2 Pi here or
any other combination of powers so

51
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,780
that the total power of 2 Pi in
the denominator is equal to 1.

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,610
And this is a metric convention
in the quantum mechanics,

53
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,090
the convention is that 2 Pi
appears in this inverse Fourier

54
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,510
transform which features the wave
reaction or the momentum.

55
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,270
So, I will just erase this stuff here.

56
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,640
So, anyways so, this is what we know and
now the simplest perhaps example of

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,940
a Fourier transform will be actually
a Fourier transform of the delta function.

58
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,990
So, if we want to Fourier
transform the delta function,

59
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,610
we know that the delta function
when integrated the value

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,660
of the function is being
integrated with at x = 0.

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,396
So and if we integrate the delta of x with
the e to par ikx from minus infinity to

62
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:58,688
plus infinity we'll simply will get
one because e exponent of zero is

63
00:03:58,688 --> 00:03:59,592
equal to one.

64
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:03,001
So, therefore the Fourier image
of the delta function is one.

65
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:06,264
Just same identity in this case basically.

66
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:11,048
So, and we can also do the inverse Fourier
transform which basically gives us

67
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:15,024
our presentation of the delta function and
it's an integral for

68
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:19,025
minus infinity to plus infinity
of this exponential dk over 2.

69
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,375
We have seen it already actually before.

70
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:25,755
So and these identities actually will
be enough for us to solve the problem.

71
00:04:25,755 --> 00:04:29,903
So, now the problem that we actually
want to solve mathematically

72
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:33,320
is the Schrödinger equation
which is presented here.

73
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,649
So, the left hand side of this equation
here represents the Newtonian, so

74
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:41,085
the Newtonian in this part is
the kinetic energy or the usual

75
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:45,299
kinetic energy written explicitly
in the coordinate representation.

76
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:49,131
So, this is just p squared over 2m and
this guy is our potential,

77
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:50,257
delta potential.

78
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,200
So, later on we're going to generalize
it to arbitrary dimension but

79
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,580
at this stage I'm just doing
1 dimension for simplicity.

80
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,850
So, of course, we're dealing now
with Schrödinger equation and

81
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,930
the goal of this calculation, basically,

82
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,810
the goal of our derivation, would be
to determine the value of the energy.

83
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,590
And in particular we would
want to figure out whether or

84
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,239
not there are bound states
with negative energy.

85
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,898
So, essentially if we want to
sort of draw symbolically the,

86
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:23,841
potential that we're dealing with so
it's, zero everywhere but

87
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:28,030
in the vicinity of x =0 there
is a sharp sort of well.

88
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,430
And the question is whether
theres a bound state or

89
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,470
bound states in this well
with some negative energy.

90
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,950
So, this is basically the question.

91
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,935
And so now, let me do the actual
calculation using this reminder and

92
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:41,940
Schrödinger equation.

93
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,290
So, what we're going to do,
we're going to represent inside facts

94
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,035
as free of transform of the wave
function in moment of our presentation.

95
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:56,850
So, this is going to be an integral of
dk over 2 Pi of sum psi tilde sub key,

96
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm going to write it.

97
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,620
E to the power- ikx,
from minus infinity to positive infinity.

98
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,830
And just for the sake of brevity,
I'm going to call this integral and so, so

99
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,840
that I don't have to write the standard
factories and limits again.

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,620
So, it is identically equal
in my notations to this.

101
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,700
So, there are three types of theorems
that appear in this equation.

102
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,990
So, the wave function itself,

103
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,988
appears in the right hand side,
multiplied by the energy.

104
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:27,940
In the left-hand side, though,
we have, for instance, this guy,

105
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,990
which is the second derivative of
the delta function, psi double prime.

106
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:37,580
So, differentiate this Fourier
transform twice over the coordinant,

107
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,760
we're going to pull out, so the of
the exponential is the exponential itself,

108
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,750
but they're going to pull
out this minus i t squared.

109
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,873
So, therefore,
we can represent this as derivative s

110
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:57,359
psi tilde sub x (-ik)
squared e to the power- ikx.

111
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:03,790
So, this guy is the Fourier
transform of psi double prime.

112
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,760
And finally we also have this term,
so delta(x) psi(x).

113
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,600
But since delta (x) is a sharply
peaked function that x = 0,

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,840
so it essentially pulls out only
the value of the wave function of x = 0.

115
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,780
So, all other values of this
wave function, in this product,

116
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,190
basically don't matter.

117
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:27,491
So, this term is going to be identically
equal to psi (0), delta (x).

118
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,660
Okay?

119
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,022
And delta (x), we know that delta (x),
before you even measure

120
00:07:34,022 --> 00:07:39,140
the delta (x) we discussed in the previous
slide, is simply equal to one.

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,620
So, we can represent this as a side
of zero and integral over k again,

122
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,130
it's implied that it's minus infinity to
the plus infinity either from minus ikx.

123
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,150
That's it.

124
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,520
So, this is basically the way we
can write this in this situation.

125
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,930
And so,
if you can put everything together, so

126
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,820
we're going to have in the left-hand side,
we're going to have- h squared over

127
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,230
2m side tilde psi tilde sub k- ik

128
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:17,850
squared either to power- ikx.

129
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:18,890
So this term,

130
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:25,250
the second term is going to be minus alpha
psi (0) which here is simply a constant.

131
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,720
So, we have pulled out the value of
the wave function (x) = 0 just a constant.

132
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,940
And here we have this
integral e to par- ikx.

133
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,500
In the right hand side, we're going to
have simply energy times the wave function

134
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,914
coming from here k psi
tilde e to the par- ikx.

135
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,550
So, we see that in all three terms,
we have these integrals and

136
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,760
we have these exponentials.

137
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,320
So, we can simply focus on the overall
coefficients that multiplies

138
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,890
all these exponentials and
essentially get what we can call it and

139
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,440
shorten your equation in momentum space.

140
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,980
So in some sense, we can just
get rid of these integrals, and

141
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,790
let me have some space here.

142
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,990
Let me erase most of this stuff.

143
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,040
So as a result, if we basically look at

144
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,950
this equation without the integrals for
a particular key.

145
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:25,225
So, this term, the first term on
the left-hand side is going to give us

146
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:28,900
plus each squared over 2m
k squared psi tilde (k).

147
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,987
The second term is going to give
us minus alpha times psi 0.

148
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,723
So, this psi zero is
elevated real space though.

149
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:43,609
And at the right-hand side is going to
be the energy that we're looking for

150
00:09:43,609 --> 00:09:45,220
so this is our unknown.

151
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,599
This is what we're looking for.

152
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,424
Psi tilde (k).

153
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:52,825
So, we see that instead of solving the
complicated differential equation as it

154
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:57,990
looked in the beginning we're now, reduced
the problem to solving essentially.

155
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,100
A linear equation that we know
how to do from high school math.

156
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,026
So, we simply can put this psi tilde,
in the left-hand side of this guy,

157
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:12,135
in the right-hand side is
we going to have h squared,

158
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:15,400
k squared over 2m- energy x psi tilde.

159
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
So these two guys.

160
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,373
And in the right-hand side we're
going to have + alpha psi (0).

161
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:25,514
So, the wave function,
the another unknown,

162
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:31,219
the wave function therefore is
simply equal to alpha psi (0).

163
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:38,690
Wave function in real space divided by h
squared p squared over 2m minus energy.

164
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,290
And, in some sense this is already
a partially solution to our problem.

165
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,911
It's a solution in the sense that it
determines the wave function in momentum

166
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:53,210
space and if we want for instance to
find the wave function in real space.

167
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:59,100
All we have to do is just inverse
Fourier transform it back to x.

168
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,770
But our main interest again is to
answer the question of whether or

169
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,410
not there are bounds
states in this potential.

170
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,920
So this, I just copied here the same
equation we derived previously.

171
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,860
So, it emphasize that this is
really what we're after here.

172
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,280
So, the question is are there
any available energy levels,

173
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,180
level in this shallow quantum well

174
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,060
which responds to particle beam
localized in the vicinity of the works.

175
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:33,217
So, it turns out that this question
can be answered from this equation,

176
00:11:33,217 --> 00:11:35,087
in just two simple steps.

177
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:40,309
And those of you who like mathematical
puzzles, sort of aficionados of these

178
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:45,388
puzzles may want to just stop the
presentation and stare at this equation.

179
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:53,270
And try to come up with a trick that will
allow you to figure out this energy.

180
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,890
But if you just want to know the trick,
let me show you how it works.

181
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,580
And it's actually very neat.

182
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,130
It doesn't require any super
complicated calculations.

183
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:07,180
So this stage, let me recall that psi
of x basically, can be represented as

184
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,366
the inverse Fourier transform of
psi tilde of k either from- iks.

185
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:17,615
So therefore, psi 0 which appears on
the right-hand side of this equation,

186
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:22,060
psi 0 corresponds simply to
setting f to 0 in this equation.

187
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,490
So it's going to be an integral
of all over all k over 2 pi

188
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,556
of this side tilde (k).

189
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:32,504
So, let me elevate this integral
in both sides of this equation.

190
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:37,060
So, we have an equation, I can take
integral of both sides of this equation.

191
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:43,450
And if I do so in the left-hand side,
I'm going to have side tilde of

192
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,313
k which for
this relation gives me simply psi (0).

193
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:53,423
While in the right-hand
side I will have this

194
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:58,802
coefficient which is
simply constant alpha psi

195
00:12:58,802 --> 00:13:04,046
(0) an integral over key 1 over h squared,

196
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:07,958
k squared over 2 m minus epsilon.

197
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,040
And so, the neat thing that
happens here is that this,

198
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,060
we see that there is a psi zero that
we don't really know at this stage but

199
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,429
the psi zero appears on both sides of
this equation so we can simply cancel it.

200
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:24,379
So, we end up with an equation that
doesn't have the function anymore.

201
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,320
So, it has only one unknown.

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,010
And this unknown is exactly
the energy we are after.

203
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,770
So, if we can solve our equation and
find the value of the energy,

204
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,170
this would imply that there exists
a bond state in our potential.

205
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,090
And remember that the bond
state has negative energy, so

206
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,980
it must be below the continuum.

207
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,440
And this would correspond sort
of to localized particles, so

208
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,870
we can simply put the same models here and
the plus sign.

209
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,250
So, this would correspond to
our energy we are looking for.

210
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,550
And also if we want sort of to
restore normal form of the integral.

211
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,660
So, we can recall that
my notation was simply

212
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,740
to save some space so
this is really what we have.

213
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,065
So, let me skip the remaining technical
step which essentially boils down just to

214
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:18,581
calculating this integral,
which is an elementary integral, and

215
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:19,953
just present the result.

216
00:14:19,953 --> 00:14:24,302
And here,
I sort of re-written this equation,

217
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:31,422
in the sort of slight a different form,
and this is a result of the calculation.

218
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:35,507
So, if you double the integral you
will see, that there exist one and

219
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,170
only one solution for the energy.

220
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,960
And the energy is equal to minus m
alpha squared over two h squared,

221
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,770
so remember alpha here is
the parameter which multiplies

222
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,230
the delta potentials since sometimes Alpha
controls the strength of this potentials.

223
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,310
This more of the Alpha the weaker
the potentials that X of the particle.

224
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,456
And the result here is that, in the
shallow quantum well in one dimension or

225
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:08,523
in the corresponding Delta potential well,
there exists one and only one

226
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:14,426
bound state with this energy, which scales
as so with the strength of the potential.

227
00:15:14,426 --> 00:15:18,665
So, in the second part of this video
we're going to discuss how this result is

228
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:23,173
modified in a very essential way if we go
to more physical dimensions, to two and

229
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:24,345
three dimensions.
