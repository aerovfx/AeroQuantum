00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.480
Okay, welcome back everybody.

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.260
Today we're going to actually
use the Feynman path integral

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.780
to obtain a few very interesting
results and physical phenomena.

4
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.160
And in the first video today,
we're going to actually,

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.820
you'll have a very unexpected
surprisingly result.

6
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.540
Mainly, we're going to see
how the Newton Equation,

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.943
second Newton law of
classical physics appears in

8
00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:34.399
the classical limit of Feynman
by Feynman path integral.

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.210
So more precisely what I'm going to do,

10
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.430
I'm going to start with the expression we
just discussed in the previous lecture.

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.920
Which tells us that the probability of

12
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.790
a quantum particle to go from
an initial point to find a point.

13
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.070
R sub f can be written as the sum or
actual value of a sum over

14
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.640
all classical trajectories which sort
of symbolically represents what we call

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.770
the path integral of this individual
quantum mechanical transition amplitude.

16
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.440
And each of these amplitudes is written
as the exponential of this constant i,

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.530
times the classic collection, and
divided by the Planck Constant.

18
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.850
And, surprisingly, what we're
going to see is that the familiar

19
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.190
Equations of motion of
the classical physics.

20
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.360
This Newton second law

21
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.920
appears as a result of taking
the classical limit of this expression.

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.590
And I'm going to formulate precisely
what I mean by the classical limit, but

23
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.650
at this stage let me just tell you that
The classical limit will imply suppressing

24
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.540
the essence of quantum mechanics
interference phenomenal

25
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.990
which are controlled by this
blank constant each bar.

26
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.670
Now, just as a side comment here
sort of historical comment.

27
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.950
Let me mention something about this
equation so of course this I expect,

28
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.670
all of you or
the majority of you to know this equation.

29
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.060
It's something we learn
sometimes in high school

30
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.420
which is the second Newton law which is
mass times acceleration of a classical

31
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.048
particle is equal to the sum of all
the forces acting on the particle.

32
00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:21.630
So apparently,
if you read actually the original

33
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.740
scientific work by Newton, the first
version, the first addition of this,

34
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.030
Principia, was published back in 1687,
a long time ago.

35
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.370
So, we're not actually going to see
this equation in this modern form.

36
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.500
The closest correlation to what we
currently call Newton's Second Law

37
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.380
of Motion appeared in his original
work in the Falling Four.

38
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.840
A change in motion is proportional
to the mighty force impressed and

39
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.829
takes place along the straight line
in which the force is presses.

40
00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.200
It probably requires some imagination to
connect this statement to this equation.

41
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.930
But, in any case obviously Newton

42
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.000
understood the basic principles
of classical mechanics.

43
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.700
He was the one who created it.

44
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.750
So, there's no question about that.

45
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.030
So, this comment I just wanted
to make to show you that.

46
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.920
Sometimes the regional discoveries will
vary strongly from their original form,

47
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.960
and become even though we still give
credit to people who were the first to put

48
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.640
them together, the final form may be quite
different from what they were envisioning,

49
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.750
and this is perfect because I'm now, going
back to the main subject of this video.

50
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.500
So now I'm going to actually
show you how mathematically this

51
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.530
all the and
well known Second Newton Laws appears from

52
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.870
this modern more sophisticated quantum
theory, similarly unrelated theory.

53
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.740
In order for me to show you how it
happens, I need to present mathematical

54
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.610
trick or method called Laplace's
methods or saddle-point approximation.

55
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.420
Which allows us to calculate
certain integrals that otherwise

56
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.110
cannot be calculated.

57
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.690
And this method as we'll see sort
propagates more complicated theories

58
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.510
including our ability to calculate
certain path integrals approximately.

59
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.870
Now we have seen already the Gaussian
integral which is an integral of

60
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.000
e to the minus x squared And
between minus infinity and plus infinity.

61
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.250
And we know the result is equal
to the square root of pi.

62
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.240
So of course what this integral is
is the area enclosed by this curve,

63
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.370
which is nothing but

64
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.320
the plot of this Gaussian function e,
-x squared, as a function of x.

65
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.130
Now of course, this function is special,
well, there's nothing very special about

66
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.230
this function, but it does appear
in many fields in math and physics.

67
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.810
And one property of this
function is that it decays very,

68
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.020
very fast when the argument
x becomes large.

69
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.260
Either they're very negative or
very positive.

70
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.730
Now, in general however if you want
to calculate the integral of let's

71
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.040
say from minus infinity to plus infinity,
or some other limits of a function,

72
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.240
e to the power, minus f(x), where f(x)
is relatively every few function.

73
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.330
There is no closed mathematical
expression, typically, for

74
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.180
recession integral.

75
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.190
But it turns out that if there is a small
parameter in the exponential, if this

76
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.210
function actually involves not just f(x)
but f(x) divided by some epsilon and

77
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.510
this epsilon is very small, then one,
in many cases, can simplify things.

78
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.800
And I will explain the logic
behind this simplification.

79
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.440
A particular example of
this function of a fact,

80
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.610
which is x squared plus one over x
squared, and so I want to integrate

81
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.230
the exponential of minus this function
from minus infinity plus infinity.

82
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.020
So, there's not closed analytical
expression for the integral of this word,

83
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.070
but it turns out that if indeed we have
this small parameter in the denominator,

84
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.680
of the exponential,
things can actually be simplified.

85
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.840
In order to see how it happens,
let me plot this function f of x.

86
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.130
And so if we do so,
we see that there is a minimum, but

87
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.790
of course due to the minus
sign in the exponential.

88
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.170
The smaller the f of x the larger
the exponential itself.

89
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.250
And vice versa, if f of x,
on the other hand, very large and

90
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.850
positive, either the the bar
minus f of x becomes negligible.

91
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.260
So if we now plot the function
f of x to one to integrate,

92
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.030
it's going to look approximately
like this, my artistic expression.

93
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.780
Of what it's going to look like, but
the point here is it is going to have

94
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.980
a maximum around where f(x) is minimal and

95
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.720
is going to have the stills
which become smaller and

96
00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.120
smaller as f(x) becomes larger.

97
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.370
So, what we want to collect
the area influenced by this curve.

98
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.410
And so some area will come from the region
of this maximum summary account will

99
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.340
come from this [INAUDIBLE].

100
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.370
So, but S epsilon,
this parameter here becomes smaller and

101
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.570
smaller, we'll see when it's 0.1 or
something like that, so

102
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.595
then it implies that our exponential
[INAUDIBLE] either part one or

103
00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:27.490
0.1 which means either part
10 of whatever the are and

104
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.710
so the will become less and less
relevant on the background of this peak.

105
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:38.430
So for instance, for a smaller epsilon,
let's say my f of x.

106
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.770
So for a smaller epsilon,
it's going to look like this.

107
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:48.280
So in some sense it's going to become
closer and closer to the Gaussian form.

108
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.451
So the reason for that.

109
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:54.600
Because if I spend my function,
f of x, in Taylor Series,

110
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.812
in the vicinity of this point,
f of x Equals 1.

111
00:07:58.812 --> 00:08:03.543
So what I'm going to get,
is the first term

112
00:08:03.543 --> 00:08:08.413
which is just the value
of my function f of f

113
00:08:08.413 --> 00:08:13.281
= 1 + f prime(f) = 1 (x- 1) + f 2

114
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:18.900
primes divided by 2 (x- 1) squared.

115
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.780
But since this is the minimum of
my function, so the derivative,

116
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.270
the first derivative of my function
here vanishes, it becomes equal to 0.

117
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:33.381
And so the only terms sort of in the
leading order that matter are this guy and

118
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:34.943
the quadratical.

119
00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:39.209
So essentially which means the integral
that I'm dealing with Gaussin.

120
00:08:39.209 --> 00:08:42.735
And as I mentioned, we know how
to calculate Gaussian integrals.

121
00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:47.455
So without going through the algebra,
let me just sort of present the results.

122
00:08:47.455 --> 00:08:52.631
So here I first present sort
of a general result for

123
00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:56.461
almost arbitrary function f(x).

124
00:08:56.461 --> 00:09:01.763
And the first factor here comes
essentially from the just simply

125
00:09:01.763 --> 00:09:07.472
calculating the value of this
exponential in the minimum point of f.

126
00:09:07.472 --> 00:09:11.365
And the second true is the result
of integrating the Gaussian part,

127
00:09:11.365 --> 00:09:14.080
much like this Gaussian integral.

128
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.645
So for the particular function, we
are not going to need this result at all.

129
00:09:18.645 --> 00:09:20.030
So it was just an example.

130
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.060
But nevertheless, here is the answer.

131
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.850
Let me also mention another fact,
which I'm not going to prove it.

132
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.360
But, it's important for the following.

133
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.530
That even if we have
a slightly different integral.

134
00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.750
When we have an exponential of i,
the measuring constant i,

135
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.980
over some small parameter and some f(x).

136
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.750
So this integral oftentimes too
can be simplified using this

137
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.190
very similar saddle-point
approximation which we just discussed.

138
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.121
And the reason for that is because e to
the power i f(x) can be written as a bunch

139
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:55.556
of cosines and sines.

140
00:09:55.556 --> 00:10:00.162
And if epsilon becomes very small,
they become strong oscillating

141
00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:04.540
functions which on the average give us 0,
if epsilon is small.

142
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.961
Because we have a plus, a positive part of
the cosine, negative part of the cosine,

143
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:13.100
and then in some sense, they balance each
other out and give on the average 0.

144
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.240
And there is a similar argument that you
can actually write the expression of this

145
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.590
integral in a very similar form and focus
only on the minimum of this function.

146
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.500
Now let me go back to quantum physics and
we're going to

147
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.690
see how the previous mathematical
discussion is going to become relevant.

148
00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:37.820
Now, remember,
my motivation in the very beginning,

149
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:42.330
I said that I want to take the classical
limit of my quantum mechanical theory.

150
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.670
So what does it mean to
take a classical limit?

151
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:51.870
So let us recall that the most interesting
quantum phenomenon that we have in quantum

152
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:57.830
mechanics was actually discovered, implied
interference between different waves,

153
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.670
sort of describing wave
functions describing a particle.

154
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.820
So if we want to kill, in some sense,
the quantum mechanical effects,

155
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.220
we want to suppress
the interference phenomena.

156
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.820
Or we want to make the wave
length as small as possible.

157
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.479
So let's say if we have
a particle with a momentum p, so

158
00:11:15.479 --> 00:11:20.336
the corresponding wave length is
going to be, per debroyles argument,

159
00:11:20.336 --> 00:11:22.341
is going to be h borrower 2 pi p.

160
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:26.917
So if you want to set a lambda to 0,
that is to completely suppress

161
00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:31.581
the interference effects of
the particle's actual wavelength,

162
00:11:31.581 --> 00:11:34.342
we want to set, in some sense, h to 0.

163
00:11:34.342 --> 00:11:38.698
So the Planck constant, which controls
the quantum effects, which is sort of

164
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:43.200
the essence of quantum mechanics, so
it should be set to 0 in order to take.

165
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.270
So now recall the expression for
the Feynman path integral.

166
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.134
So we see that in the quasi classical
limit, in the classical limit,

167
00:11:51.134 --> 00:11:55.467
when h formally is taken to 0, the
function that we are actually a functional

168
00:11:55.467 --> 00:11:59.668
better to say that we're integrating
becomes in some sense very similar to

169
00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:03.590
the types of functions that
we saw in the previous slide.

170
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:04.940
With the h bar here,

171
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:09.951
the Planck constant being equivalent
in a sense to the parameter epsilon,

172
00:12:09.951 --> 00:12:14.740
that control the applicability of
the saddle-point approximation.

173
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.670
And also in the full analogy with this
previous slide with this saddle-point

174
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.590
approximation, we can see that as
h becomes smaller and smaller so

175
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:28.500
we can only focus on the trajectories
in the vicinity of the trajectory for

176
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.780
which the action is minimal.

177
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:37.400
So basically the limit of h going to
0 therefore reproduces the principle

178
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.420
of least action, which is another sort
of cornerstone of classical physics.

179
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:48.000
Now I should comment here that of
course h bar, the Planck constant,

180
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.170
is a fundamental physics constant.

181
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.440
We cannot take it to 0.

182
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.730
We cannot take the limit
physically of h bar going to 0.

183
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.460
What it actually means when I'm saying
that h bar goes to 0 and this also you're

184
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.580
going to see in the textbooks on
quasi-classical approximation.

185
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.620
It means that we have essentially two
types of length scales in our problem.

186
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.600
One type of length scale is the wave
lengths of our quantum particles, and

187
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.050
the other type of length scales is
the typical length scales in our system.

188
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.100
And if the wave length of our quantum
particles are much more than everything

189
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.504
else, this effectively
means this limit and

190
00:13:22.504 --> 00:13:27.142
this effectively means the applicability
of the quasi-classical approximations.

191
00:13:27.142 --> 00:13:31.517
So for those of you familiar with
Lagrangian classical mechanics,

192
00:13:31.517 --> 00:13:36.506
it should be clear now that principle of
least action all ready demands that we

193
00:13:36.506 --> 00:13:40.191
essentially are going to
reproduce Newton's equations as

194
00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:43.365
was advertised at
the beginning of the lecture.

195
00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:48.153
So you can stop listening to the lecture
right here and move on to the next part.

196
00:13:48.153 --> 00:13:52.856
But for the sake of completeness,
let me nevertheless present, or

197
00:13:52.856 --> 00:13:56.661
remind you,
of how these equations would come about.

198
00:13:56.661 --> 00:14:01.380
So again, the question that we're now
asking, okay, we have found that,

199
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.107
well if we take the Planck constant to 0,
or

200
00:14:04.107 --> 00:14:08.903
if we consider the wave lengths which
are much smaller than everything else,

201
00:14:08.903 --> 00:14:13.665
we must extract the minimum of the
classical action from the path integral.

202
00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:17.835
And this minimum would occur on
a particular trajectory that particle

203
00:14:17.835 --> 00:14:18.900
would follow.

204
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.140
So how to find this special trajectory?

205
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.210
So we can sort of motivate the standard,
what is known as variational analysis by

206
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.910
this, again,
simple analogy using the usual function.

207
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.580
So suppose we have
an arbitrary function f(x),

208
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.480
which has a minimum or
maximum principal too, somewhere.

209
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.090
But let's assume it's a minimum.

210
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.710
And we want to determine the point
where this minimum actually occurs.

211
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.440
And for this I can again use
the Taylor expansion for

212
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.800
this function f in the vicinity of this
point, x0 that I'm trying to find.

213
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.280
And so it's going to have the value of
the function at x0, the first derivative,

214
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.430
the second derivative, etc.

215
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.595
And the minimum of this functions,
if I have functions, so

216
00:15:00.595 --> 00:15:03.590
this minimum is going to
occur where this derivative,

217
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:09.000
where the tangent to this plot,
f(x), as a function of x is

218
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.630
going to be horizontal to the x direction
or the first derivative vanishes.

219
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.940
Now an analogy to this if we
have now a function of or

220
00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.970
in particular our action as a fact.

221
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.040
So to determine a particular trajectory
which we will identify as a classical

222
00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.250
trajectory.

223
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:32.860
So we have to demand that if we calculate
this action in the vicinity of this

224
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.350
classical trajectory for which the action
is minimal, the first sort of variation of

225
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:42.580
the analogy, well the analogous part to
this first derivative is going to vanish.

226
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.582
And this symbol, delta S = 0.

227
00:15:45.582 --> 00:15:50.538
So this equation is a sort of
mathematical expression for

228
00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:53.643
this principle of the list action.

229
00:15:53.643 --> 00:15:58.763
And in some sense, all of classical
physics is contained in this equation,

230
00:15:58.763 --> 00:16:01.333
which is actually quite remarkable.

231
00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:06.840
Now if we now go back to, well, and recall
the particular action we are studying now,

232
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.814
which is just the kinetic energy,
mv squared/2- the potential energy for

233
00:16:11.814 --> 00:16:13.940
a certain quantum particle.

234
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.502
So in order to find the classical
trajectory, as we know,

235
00:16:17.502 --> 00:16:21.719
we want to calculate the first variation,
and we do so by writing this

236
00:16:21.719 --> 00:16:26.208
action in the vicinity of the classical
trajectory that we want to find.

237
00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:29.100
So in some sense, what we should
think about is that we have this

238
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.480
initial point and
we have this final point, and

239
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:36.370
there is some unique trajectory
that we are looking for.

240
00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.477
But there're also trajectory
very close to it.

241
00:16:40.718 --> 00:16:45.069
And this deviation from this, so
this black trajectory here is

242
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:49.600
the classical trajectory and
the red ones are classical plus dr.

243
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.570
And this dr is a small deviation
from the classical path.

244
00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:58.780
So if we now just simply plug this
expression into this expression for

245
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.290
the action, so we are going to have
the kinetic energy through, so

246
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:10.030
of course the velocity is just dr/dt, or
abbreviated, we can write it as r dot.

247
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.720
So we're going to have here the two terms.

248
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.130
And we're going to have two terms as
an argument of the potential energy.

249
00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:20.940
And since dr is very small, we're going to
keep track only of the linear terms here.

250
00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:25.846
So for example,
in the kinetic energy part, so

251
00:17:25.846 --> 00:17:31.980
here we're going to have m/2
plus equal velocity squared,

252
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.149
plus the linear term,
which comes from 2r.dr.

253
00:17:37.149 --> 00:17:43.255
So we're going to have m r
plus equal dot plus dr dot.

254
00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:45.766
And this guy, what we're going to do,

255
00:17:45.766 --> 00:17:50.638
we're going to expand this function
in Taylor series up to linear order.

256
00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:56.410
And again, we can do that
because this dr is very small.

257
00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:01.454
And so we're going to have the classical

258
00:18:01.454 --> 00:18:08.710
V of r classical minus dv/dr,
the gradient, dot dr.

259
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:14.770
And everything integrated over time.

260
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.360
So we have four terms here.

261
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.170
So this term is simple enough.

262
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:22.780
And these two terms actually, this guy and
this guy, together, they represent

263
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:27.510
the classical action, so the one which
occurs on the classical trajectory.

264
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.330
Remember, what we want is not
the classical action itself.

265
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.812
But in some sense
the derivative of the action,

266
00:18:32.812 --> 00:18:35.998
basically with something which
is proportional to this dr.

267
00:18:35.998 --> 00:18:40.390
The only term which is sort of
non trivial is this guy, okay?

268
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:47.510
And it can be further simplified
by using the integration by parts.

269
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.606
So just to remind you, I'm sure you have,
many of you have seen it before.

270
00:18:50.606 --> 00:18:54.880
So if we have an integral,
let's say from a to b,

271
00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.080
of a function f with terms g'dx,
so we can write it as

272
00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:06.990
derivative of everything of g'- f'g.

273
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:12.650
And so here, I have the full derivative,
and I can basically calculate

274
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.570
the value of the functions.

275
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.286
And the limits essentially move
the derivative from the function g to

276
00:19:20.286 --> 00:19:22.170
the function f.

277
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:27.680
Now in our case, the role of
the function g is played by this dr dot,

278
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.610
and the role of the function
f is played by this mr dot.

279
00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.796
So we want to move the derivative
over time from here to here.

280
00:19:33.796 --> 00:19:38.832
But this full derivative term,
so if we're going to calculate

281
00:19:38.832 --> 00:19:43.767
the values of this function dr
in the endpoints at time 0 and

282
00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:49.840
time t, they correspond to
the endpoints of this trajectory.

283
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.388
So in our trajectory remember spinned, so

284
00:19:52.388 --> 00:19:56.873
we have to go from the prescribed
initial point to prescribed final point.

285
00:19:56.873 --> 00:19:58.600
So there is no freedom for

286
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:03.889
this sort of fluctuation to deviate
from these initial and final points.

287
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.743
It can only deviate from
the classical trajectory in between.

288
00:20:07.743 --> 00:20:10.558
So what I'm saying here is that this term,

289
00:20:10.558 --> 00:20:14.780
the full derivative term in this
particular case vanishes, and

290
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:19.720
we can simply move the derivative
from here to here with a minus sign.

291
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.600
If we put everything together based
on this discussion, so essentially,

292
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:29.980
if we integrate by parts and replace this
and this term with classical action.

293
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:35.271
We're going to have this classical
action minus because there

294
00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:40.457
isn't going to be minus here and
there is already minus here,

295
00:20:40.457 --> 00:20:45.432
integral from 0 to r,
m r two dots, second derivative,

296
00:20:45.432 --> 00:20:48.566
because we moved it, plus dv/dr.

297
00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:54.038
And everything is multiplied
by this thing, dt.

298
00:20:54.038 --> 00:20:58.448
Now remember,
this is exactly our first derivation, and

299
00:20:58.448 --> 00:21:01.330
this is something we want to set to 0.

300
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.274
And this guy must be equal to 0 for

301
00:21:03.274 --> 00:21:08.460
every possible sort of fluctuation
away from the classical trajectory.

302
00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.680
And this implies that this
expression in the curly brackets, so

303
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.800
this expression must be
identically equal to 0 for

304
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.720
the first variation to vanish for us to
be able to find the minimal reaction.

305
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.169
And if we're actually going to write it,

306
00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:33.769
we're going to get m r two
dots is equal to -dv/dr.

307
00:21:34.956 --> 00:21:39.990
Well, the second derivative for the
coordinate is known as the acceleration,

308
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:45.920
so the left hand side is simply m times a,
and the right hand side

309
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.040
is the gradient of the potential energy,
which is the force acting on the particle.

310
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.644
So we see that we indeed have derived the,

311
00:21:56.026 --> 00:22:03.330
Newton second law from the principle
of the action being minimal.

312
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:08.076
This principle itself followed from
us taking the formal limit of h

313
00:22:08.076 --> 00:22:13.060
bar going to 0, from setting to 0
the wavelengths of our particles.
