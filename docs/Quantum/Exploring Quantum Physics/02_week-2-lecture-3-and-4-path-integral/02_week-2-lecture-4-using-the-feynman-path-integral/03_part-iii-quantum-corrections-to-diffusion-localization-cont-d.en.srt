1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,240
So in the second part of this segment,
I'm going to elaborate on the phenomenon.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,570
And in particular, I will discuss
in more detail the self-crossing

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,600
trajectories that are responsible it.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,020
And [INAUDIBLE] identify
the physical circumstances

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,830
under which they are actually important.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,520
And this discussion is going to
be under the title I put here,

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,220
Quantum corrections to diffusion.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,260
But before going back to this quantum
corrections that we already mentioned in

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:36,130
the previous video, let me remind you
what classical diffusion actually is.

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,650
Actually the phenomenon of diffusion,

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,420
you can observe at home by performing
a rather simple experiment.

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,640
If you put a droplet of a dye in water and
watch it spread out with time.

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,507
So this evolution of this droplet,
time evolution spreading out of this

14
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:58,417
droplet is going to be described
by the diffusion equation,

15
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:02,119
presented here with some
diffusion coefficient, D.

16
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:06,028
But the phenomenal diffusion and
the diffusion equation itself

17
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:10,740
are of course much more general than
this particular physical realization.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,929
And they happen whenever
we have a large number of

19
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:18,980
particles experiencing a random walk.

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,250
So random walk is, if you can think
about it as particle which moves,

21
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,890
every time step it moves
in a certain direction.

22
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,610
It can go up.

23
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,300
It can go right.

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,090
It can go up.

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,880
It can go down.

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,160
It can go left, up, etc.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,343
And so, at each moment in
time there is a probability,

28
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,986
an equal probability to
go in any direction.

29
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:42,446
And so, if a lot of such
particles are put together and

30
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:47,123
if you look at this particles
from a large length scale.

31
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:48,216
So their density,

32
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:52,324
the evolution of their density is
going to be described by this equation.

33
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:57,990
And so here is in general,
a function of position and time.

34
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,911
So how it is relevant to the previous
discussion about elections and

35
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:03,440
moving in the metal.

36
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,180
So there, as we mentioned, so the
disorders, some imperfections in the metal

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,960
play the role of sketchers, that somehow
randomize the electron trajectories.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,980
And so we can think of what electrons
experiencing this random walk.

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,120
And since there are many, many central
electrons in a piece of metal, so

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,070
if we want to describe their density,

41
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,590
the disc is going to follow
the diffusion equation.

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,360
So another interpretation of
the diffusion equation is that the straw

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,210
is actually a probability density
of finding a particular random

44
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,600
walking particle in a certain moment
of time at a certain position in space.

45
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,300
So there is probabilistic interpretation
of this equation, if you want.

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,525
Now, another common note I'd like to make
about this equation is that actually,

47
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:55,230
in some sense,

48
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,454
it looks similar to the Schroedinger
equation in quantum mechanics.

49
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:01,895
So if we were to put in
the measuring constant I here,

50
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:06,839
which we don't have to put, but
if we were to measure some imaginary time.

51
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:10,984
So, and instead of the coefficient D,
we would have had, let's say,

52
00:03:10,984 --> 00:03:12,520
minus H squared over 2 M.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,415
Then this equation would have become free,

54
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:19,729
a SchrÃ¶dinger equation of a free
particle for the wave function.

55
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:23,095
So this is a purely mathematical analogy,
I should say, but

56
00:03:23,095 --> 00:03:27,257
this mathematical analogy, in certain
cases, actually goes a long way.

57
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:31,061
And allows us to calculate
things that otherwise would have

58
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:33,352
been very difficult to calculate.

59
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:34,395
So at this stage,

60
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:38,860
however, we don't want necessarily to
involve in any of these analogies.

61
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,300
Instead, let me focus on the equation
of relevance to the phenomenon of

62
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,420
that I mentioned.

63
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,170
Namely, on the self-crossing trajectories,
so in here,

64
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,890
I'm talking about self-crossing
trajectories of some diffusive particles.

65
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,760
So let's say, to here actually what I mean
is that there is some small length scale

66
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,230
each particle diffuses around.

67
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,730
But as a result,
in a realization of this random walk,

68
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,320
it may lead to this
self-crossing trajectory.

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,338
And so from the perspective
of this crossing point,

70
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:11,904
what it actually means is that
I'm asking the question of what

71
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,447
is the probability for a particle to
return to the same point where it started?

72
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:19,563
So let's say,
I set an initial condition for

73
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:23,095
my density at t = 0 to be
a delta function in space.

74
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:28,425
So delta function, very sharply localized
density in this particular point.

75
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:32,475
Now it turns out that one can actually
solve exactly the diffusion equation

76
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:33,735
with this initial condition.

77
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:37,430
It's actually called the green function
and this fundamental solution,

78
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,090
the general solution to the diffusion
equation is written here.

79
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,590
Here again, r denotes the coordinate
in space, T is time, D is

80
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,560
the diffusion coefficient, and this small
d denotes the dimensionality of space.

81
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,520
So it can be either one dimensional
space or three dimensional space or

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,240
two dimensional space.

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,868
And in order for us to find
the probability to return to the origin,

84
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:07,250
let's say we are looking for
the probability with a self rising

85
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,982
trajectory which starts from r equal 0 and
goes back to r equals 0.

86
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:15,833
So it means that we have to set
r equal 0 in this expression or

87
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,380
set exponential to 1.

88
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,210
And that's what we're going to get for
the probability of self-intersection.

89
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,520
So again, what this guy implies is that
if we take it random working particles,

90
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,100
put it by hand in the orange and
let it random walk.

91
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,900
So this guy gives us the probability of it
to return to the vicinity, the probability

92
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,509
density more precisely to return to the
vicinity of this point in the time sheet.

93
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,558
So now, let us recall about why you're
talking about this self-crossing

94
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:44,466
trajectories.

95
00:05:44,466 --> 00:05:48,928
So the context in which they
appear was the diffusion of

96
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:53,010
electrons in the metal and
we wanted to see again.

97
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,659
We wanted to find the probability for

98
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:00,444
an electron to diffuse from an initial
point to some final point and

99
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,809
there are many different
trajectories that have used that.

100
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,839
So and we focus on the quantum theorems,

101
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,013
the quantum interference theorems
where different trajectories,

102
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:17,130
l1 not equal to l2 would
interfere with one another.

103
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,805
And the interference theorem was
this cosine of the difference in

104
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:25,715
length between two given
trajectories times p

105
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:29,550
typical momentum of an electron
divided by each bar.

106
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,010
And the statement was unless L1 was
actually equal to L2 this interference

107
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,432
theorem would kill each other or
every each other to zero.

108
00:06:37,432 --> 00:06:41,248
Because you will get just a collection of
negative and positive random numbers and

109
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:42,750
on issue we'll get 0.

110
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,730
But for the special kinds of terms
where it can go clockwise or

111
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,780
counterclockwise around
a certain trajectory,

112
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,580
this delta L here would be 0 and
cosine of 0 is equal to 1.

113
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,060
So we'll get a prescribed
contribution from these guys.

114
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,280
And so, what we're trying to figure
out now is how probable it is for

115
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,940
us to actually get this
self-crossing trajectory at all and

116
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,410
this is determined by this equation.

117
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,030
But this guy tells us
this probability density

118
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,710
to return to an original
point in a particular time T.

119
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,380
Well, what we are interested
in is any self-intersection.

120
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,080
It doesn't have to be accurate
necessarily in this particular time T,

121
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,690
it has to occur at some point.

122
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:25,300
So in order to calculate the total
probability which I will denote as piece

123
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,060
of total, I have to integrate
this expression over time

124
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,800
from some minimal t to some maximal t.

125
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,760
So in here, I should mention that I am
dropping the overall coefficients, I'm not

126
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,570
keeping track of the coefficients, I'm
just focusing on the most important terms.

127
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,950
Now, the minimal time here is the minimal
time that the diffusion equation

128
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,510
is able to resolve.

129
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,420
Being an approximation, it cannot
describe the motion shorter in time than

130
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:03,970
the consecutive collisions, let's say
of the electron between two impurities.

131
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,870
So these guys of the order TAO, which
was actually introduced In the beginning

132
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,640
of the previous video but I should
mention that it's actually not important.

133
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,930
What it actually is, it is only
important that there is some cut off.

134
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,120
On the other hand,
even if there is no dephasing processes.

135
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,979
If there is defreeze quamtum mechanical
phase is perfectly preserved,

136
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:26,890
there is no maximum data.

137
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,910
So this guy actually goes infinity and
therefore,

138
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:35,455
the integral that we actually have is
an integral from TAO to infinity of dt,

139
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:38,640
t to the power of d over 2.

140
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,555
And this integral we can
now easily recalculate and

141
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:48,847
what is extremely important, what is
crucial, is that this integral is finite.

142
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:54,198
If we are in three dimensional space,
and which we leave but it's infinite,

143
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:58,330
it's equal to infinity if we
are in a one or two dimensions.

144
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,403
So physically, it implies the full
lengths, so that if we start let's say,

145
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:09,182
imagine you're in a spaceship and you're
sort of flying around in a completely

146
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,699
random directions in three dimensions.

147
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,911
So this result tells us that
you're going to be lost,

148
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:18,882
you're never going to return to
the point that you started from.

149
00:09:18,882 --> 00:09:23,236
On the other hand,
if you start walking around in a city,

150
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:28,340
in a town or city you don't know and
you walk randomly long enough.

151
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:32,240
You are actually guaranteed to return
to the vicinity of the point where

152
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,025
you started.

153
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:38,013
From the point of view of the electrons,
so this result implies that if we have

154
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:41,179
a motion of electrons in one and
two dimensions.

155
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:44,894
So there will be an infinite number
of cell crossing trajectories and

156
00:09:44,894 --> 00:09:47,980
the probability of cell crossing
is going to be equal to 1.

157
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,816
So this term is actually going to matter
enormously at low temperatures and

158
00:09:52,816 --> 00:09:57,572
they're going to blow up and lead to
localization in low dimensions, and

159
00:09:57,572 --> 00:09:59,731
this is actually what happens.

160
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:03,725
So if we now actually think about
the physical concept once this of course

161
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:04,257
begins.

162
00:10:04,257 --> 00:10:08,624
So this in principle, everything
I'm talking about here is a rather

163
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:13,030
complicated theories,
if we were to study it in full details.

164
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,852
But, I just basically want to,
maybe we'll leave this result here,

165
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:21,950
total probability of self
intersection is really the key.

166
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,849
The reason for this video is just really
to get you this a result, essentially.

167
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:29,450
What it tells us in conjunction
with the path integral argument and

168
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,987
some intuitive arguments is that
in low dimensions the electrons

169
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,515
are going to get localized
at low temperatures.

170
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:40,017
They're going to tend to return to
the same point and this localization is

171
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:43,479
going to be consequence of
the wave nature of particles.

172
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:45,514
From the experimental point of view,

173
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:48,883
what it actually means is that
if you perform a measurement of,

174
00:10:48,883 --> 00:10:53,099
let's say resistance, which is one
[INAUDIBLE] as a function of temperature.

175
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:57,061
So at high temperature were various
effects, disturb the phase, so

176
00:10:57,061 --> 00:11:00,764
this quantum interference
phenomena basically unimportant.

177
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:05,085
Whether or not the trajectories cross or
not doesn't play any role, so

178
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:09,334
you will have some resistance and
it will slowly actually decrease but

179
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:14,260
then at some point, it will actually
shoot up and become an insulator.

180
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,728
Now in this quantitative curve, so
this part of the curve responds to

181
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:22,976
the weak localization phenomenon
that we have been discussing.

182
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:27,765
And this part is the classical
conductivity which

183
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:31,360
goes back to more than
a hundred years ago.

184
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,543
And the prediction is that in one and
two dimensions per this argument,

185
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:37,089
these quantum interference terms
are going to take over and

186
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,537
you're going to get a insulator.

187
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:43,597
While in three dimensions, actually what's
expected is that they're going to remain

188
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:48,040
a metal and the resistivity is going to
saturate in 3D for some finite value.

189
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,060
And this is indeed what happens, so and

190
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,730
there do exists the quasi one-dimensional
and quasi two-dimensional materials.

191
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:01,310
Let's say, nanowires and
so-called semiconductor heterostructures,

192
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,678
two-dimensional films where
this behavior is observed.

193
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:09,992
So I should emphasize again that the full
theory of this localization is extremely

194
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:13,616
complicated theory and we just got
a flavor of it, so hopefully, but

195
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:15,010
it's not the full story.

196
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:19,950
And interestingly enough,
what I told you about here,

197
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,250
actually this weak localization is
a precursor to a different phenomenon.

198
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:29,740
Which is actually called strong
localization for which Phil Anderson,

199
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,784
a Professor [INAUDIBLE] Princeton
got his Nobel Prize in 1977.

200
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:38,772
So we obviously don't have time now
to discuss in any detail this very

201
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:42,021
interesting and
complicated theory of Phil Anderson.

202
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:46,226
But let me just mention that next week,
we're going to go back to standard quantum

203
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:50,588
mechanics and one problem we're going to
solve is a particle in the potential well.

204
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:54,857
And in this problem, we're going to see
that the particle when put in a potential

205
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,623
well, gets localized by the well
with some discrete energy levels.

206
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:02,120
Not continual energy levels but
discrete levels.

207
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,880
And so,
the essence of the theory of Anderson,

208
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,090
it can be summarized in a few seconds.

209
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,610
Is that in a random [INAUDIBLE]
shows potential wells, so

210
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:13,170
this is let's say, V of r.

211
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,920
So the energy levels that
electrons are going to acquire

212
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,520
are going to match each other.

213
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,754
And so, they are going to be able to
move half from well to well because of

214
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:24,442
the energy conservation.

215
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,924
And this would completely
suppress the conductivity and

216
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,398
this will lead to the strong [INAUDIBLE].

217
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:35,438
So that's the only thing I'm going to
say and next week, actually we're

218
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:40,394
going to study simpler phenomena
using the Schroedinger formulation,

219
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:44,430
in particular the appearance
of energy levels.
