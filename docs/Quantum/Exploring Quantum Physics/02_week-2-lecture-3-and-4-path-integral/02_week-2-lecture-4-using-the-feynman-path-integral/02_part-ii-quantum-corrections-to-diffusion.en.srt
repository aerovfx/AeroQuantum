1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:05,410
Until now, we have been studying
mostly quantum theories and

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,770
physical phenomena, which were
discovered a relatively long time ago.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,390
So I think maybe the latest theoretical
development we talked about,

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,470
the path integral itself,
goes back to the 40s, 1940s.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,990
Today in this video,
towards the end of the video,

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,555
I'm going to tell you about a more
recent theoretical development,

7
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:32,040
so-called theory of quantum localization,
or more precisely, weak localization.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,080
And I will do so using the main
ideas of the Feynman path integral.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,620
So I should mention that the full theory
of quantum localization is an extremely

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,520
complicated mathematical theory, and it
could be a subject of a separate course.

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,611
So I don't have time for
that, and obviously,

12
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:52,660
we don't have the mathematical sort
of background to talk about it.

13
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,842
But it turns out that some basic
ideas behind this phenomenon

14
00:00:57,842 --> 00:01:02,111
can be understood using
the basic concepts behind

15
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:06,696
the Feynman path integral,
which comes handy here.

16
00:01:06,696 --> 00:01:11,590
So just in a few words, what I'm going to
be talking about here is the following.

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,010
So we know that in solid state physics,
materials

18
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,350
sort of can be divided into roughly
two categories, insulators and metals.

19
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,970
There are also semi conductors,
but from this perspective,

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,940
they are much like insulators.

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,546
What insulators are, if you apply
with electric field, the electrons,

22
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:32,000
which is just inside the material,
don't move.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,350
And so, there's no current really in
response to electric field, so if you

24
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,960
think about a piece of wood or something
like that, so we obviously understand it's

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,910
an insulator, it's not going to be
a very useful electric component.

26
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,264
On the other hand, if you have a metallic
system, let's say a piece of copper, and

27
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:52,070
if we apply electric field, or a voltage,
there will be current in response to

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,270
this electric field, and so
this characterizes a metal.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,629
So and then in your real material,
whether it's an insulator, a metal,

30
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:02,390
there is some imperfections.

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,280
Disorder, impurities, dislocations,
all kinds of things, and this,

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,490
in metals, these impurities and
dislocations, etc, so

33
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,610
these imperfections,
they lead to a finite resistance, okay?

34
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,490
And so, first in the next slide,

35
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,440
I will tell you about how this
resistance comes about, but later on,

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,590
we will see how the essentially classical
theory of transport that applies to

37
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:31,770
most metals at high temperature get more
defied as you go to lower temperatures.

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,590
And at low temperatures,
quantum effects come into play.

39
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,140
The way of nature, for
instance, comes into play.

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,460
And this is very interesting.

41
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,590
And it turns out that under
certain circumstances,

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,560
you can get completely different
heat at low temperatures.

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,300
The nipples, actually,
would become insulators.

44
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,508
And this process of trapping the electrons
due to quantum mechanical effects is

45
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:53,776
called localization.

46
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:57,531
So of course, it's a very mathematical
theory as I told you, but

47
00:02:57,531 --> 00:03:00,850
we will try to get some idea
about where it comes from.

48
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,689
But before discussing
a complicated quantum theory,

49
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:09,612
let me first talk about a basic classical,
very simple theory of how we

50
00:03:09,612 --> 00:03:13,298
can understand electrical
transferred in a metal.

51
00:03:13,298 --> 00:03:16,308
So here,
this black dot labels an electron,

52
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:21,695
which can move around in a piece of metal,
and these red dots here, larger dots,

53
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:27,240
they represent some impurities,
of which the electron gets scattered.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,900
And that's exactly what it
does is it moves it around, so

55
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,478
it gets scattered by these red impurities,
and

56
00:03:33,478 --> 00:03:36,860
so the trajectory of this electron
is this diffuser trajectory.

57
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,820
So, the random walk.

58
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,770
Of course, it's not just one.

59
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,700
There are many, many electrons in
the metal, and they all experience

60
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,620
this random walk, which in the absence of
an electric field just averages out to 0.

61
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,290
There is no net current,
there is no preferential direction.

62
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,370
There is nothing which
breaks the symmetry.

63
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,590
But now if we, let's say, apply electric
field in this direction, the electrons,

64
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,980
which have a negative charge,

65
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,470
are going to move in the opposite
direction preferentially.

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,430
They are still going to move around in
all directions, but there will be sort of

67
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,060
a drift in one particular direction,
and this will give rise to a current.

68
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,700
Now it turns out that
the first theory of this

69
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,830
conductivity of this current in
the metal was put together back in 1900.

70
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:21,044
And this theory is
the so-called Drude theory,

71
00:04:21,044 --> 00:04:24,720
which is a very simplistic theory
that I'm going to explain now.

72
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,420
So basically,

73
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,620
the Drude model assumed that we can just
view the electron as a classical particle,

74
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,490
which therefore satisfies the classical
equations of motion that Newton equation.

75
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,770
And in the presence of electric fields,
so let's say the charge is q, so

76
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,430
it experiences this force
due to the electric field.

77
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,380
And these impurities,
all these imperfections,

78
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,630
he just replaced with the friction force.

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,030
And this friction force was assumed
to be proportional to the velocity.

80
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,350
Let's say, it sort of make sense if you
have a viscous fluid for instance, and

81
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:00,280
if you put an object that's
going to move in this fluid.

82
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,190
So it's going to experience some force,
friction, which is proportional

83
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,050
to the velocity and with a minus sign of
course, and there is some coefficient.

84
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,490
So the velocity is momentum divided by the
mass, so we can write, instead of writing

85
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,230
the frictional force this way, we can
write it as minus p over t over some tau,

86
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:24,520
which is a time scale which describes
momentum relaxation in this process.

87
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,940
So in some sense,
you may think about this tau as

88
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,510
the typical time between collisions for
the electron.

89
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,040
But in the Drude model, it was just
a sort of phenomenological parameter

90
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,400
that described friction or
momentum relaxation of this electron.

91
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,910
And now, what he did, he simply wrote
down this model, and so of course,

92
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,588
we can write the left hand side
of the Newton equation as dp/dt.

93
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:58,685
And so the right hand side is putting
this together is going to be the electric

94
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:01,661
force and
this friction force ,and in equilibrium,

95
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,786
we demand that there's no
acceleration of electrons.

96
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:08,822
So if we take, let's say, a piece of
metal, apply some electric field,

97
00:06:08,822 --> 00:06:12,420
eventually it's going to come to
some sort of steady equilibrium.

98
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,370
There is going to be a current,

99
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,070
but there's not going to be
indefinite acceleration of electrons.

100
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:21,279
So they're going to come to
a certain sort of steady state, and

101
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,490
this steady state will
determine the current.

102
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,250
Now from here, what we can do,
we can just solve for the velocity.

103
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:39,460
So momentum from this equation is
going to be equal q times E times tau.

104
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,789
And velocity therefore is going to be
just momentum divided by the mass.

105
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,480
And at this stage, what we can
do is we can write the current.

106
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,820
So the current is simply the charge of
the carriers, in this case, the electrons,

107
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,210
times the density of these carriers, how
many of those participate in transport.

108
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,070
And v is the velocity,
which we just determined.

109
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,145
And so if we put everything together,
we're going to get this expression, so

110
00:07:04,145 --> 00:07:06,979
it's going to be this coefficient,
which is called conductivity, and

111
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:08,200
times the electric field.

112
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,150
So by definition actually,
the conductivity is the coefficient of

113
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,240
proportionality between the current and
the electric field.

114
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,990
And so this expression,
this n q squared tau over m is the so

115
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,550
called Drude conductivity,
which as you can see,

116
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:27,680
the purely classical entity, so there is
no quantum mechanics here whatsoever.

117
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,640
Now embarrassing thing that I have
to admit at this stage is that

118
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,600
almost all sort of useful theories
of metals, of transporting metals,

119
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,000
rely on this Drude
equation up to this date.

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,490
So since, for more than 100 years,
we've been using this equation and

121
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,950
in most cases, it actually works fine.

122
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,300
But fortunately, well for us scientists,

123
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,120
otherwise it would have
been really boring.

124
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,240
So if you go to lower temperatures, the
situation becomes a little more tricky.

125
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,620
And this is because quantum
mechanics becomes important.

126
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,010
So quantum mechanics come into play.

127
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,110
And what it means is that in this picture,
for instance, with how we can envision

128
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,650
the appearance of quantum is that instead
of just straight trajectories of classical

129
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:15,820
particles, we're going to have waves
bouncing around of these impurities.

130
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:20,190
And so these waves are going to
interfere with each other in some sense.

131
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,520
So it's going to be the particle
is going to interfere with itself.

132
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,060
And these quantum interference
effects are going to modify

133
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,540
this picture very significantly.

134
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,292
So now let us look at
the electron motion in a metal,

135
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:35,692
in a disordered metal from
a slightly different perspective.

136
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:38,769
Actually, from a completely
different perspective,

137
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,180
because now we want to explicitly
turn on quantum mechanics.

138
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,921
And we will use quantum mechanics and
partition quantum mechanics due to Feynman

139
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:50,545
and ask the question what is
the probability for an electron to

140
00:08:50,545 --> 00:08:56,220
diffuse from an initial point to final
point through this forest of impurities.

141
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,310
And according to the Feynman, this
probability can be written as the absolute

142
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,100
value squared of a sum of
quantum mechanical amplitudes,

143
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,230
associated with all
possible classical paths.

144
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,420
This diffuse the trajectory in here.

145
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,270
I'm just showing two such
possible trajectories.

146
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,490
This blue one and the black one and

147
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,850
these guys are going to
interfere with one another.

148
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,500
And this interference, so for
instance, if I pulled this trajectory,

149
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,928
trajectory one and
this is going to be trajectory two.

150
00:09:25,928 --> 00:09:32,700
So the interference term, which is
going to appear from this expression,

151
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,540
is going to involve a product
of this black exponential,

152
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,910
e to the par i s1 h bar,
times the blue exponential,

153
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,510
which is complex conjugate,
i s2 divided by h bar.

154
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,910
Plus its complex conjugate, so all in all,
the interference term, coming from

155
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,280
these two particular trajectories,
again, this is just two examples.

156
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,408
There are infinitely many
such trajectories and

157
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:04,133
infinitely many such terms, but in any
case, each of these terms is going to

158
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:07,738
produce a sort of cosine of s1- s2 and
divided by h1.

159
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:10,710
So this is basically
the quantum interference terms.

160
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,610
And the terms, which don't involve
the cross product of different

161
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,220
trajectory site, classical terms.

162
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,640
So in some sense, these are the terms,
which are responsible for

163
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,594
the Drude conductivity,

164
00:10:19,594 --> 00:10:25,870
the classical Drude conductivity that we
obtained in the previous discussion, okay?

165
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,980
And so now, the question of what
is quantum mechanics doing,

166
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,385
what are the quantum corrections,

167
00:10:31,385 --> 00:10:34,377
boils down to figuring out
what these terms are actually.

168
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,250
Now, in the beginning of this video,
I mentioned something about temperatures.

169
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,551
I said, well, at high temperature,
these terms don't really matter,

170
00:10:43,551 --> 00:10:45,588
at low temperatures, they start to matter.

171
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:49,496
And the reason this is the case, because
at high temperatures, what the temperature

172
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:53,131
really is, it involves a lot of motion,
which occurs around these electrons,

173
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:56,870
which are sort of doing their thing,
moving around, diffusing around.

174
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,930
But there is also, let's say, lattice
vibrations, all kinds of things, and

175
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,070
this sort of shaking of
the electron disturbs the phases.

176
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,291
So in some sense,
this is what is called sometimes,

177
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,430
in quantum mechanical literature,
this is called dephasing.

178
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,890
So basically here in this expression,
whatever theory we're going to be doing,

179
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,552
we're going to determine those actions.

180
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:18,730
We're going to assume that phase
1 mechanical phase is going to

181
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,640
remain constant, during or
uninterrupted method,

182
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,350
say during the motion of
electron along these projections.

183
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,820
But it turns out that even if we assume
that there's no disturbance of the phases

184
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,550
and no dephasing, so classical
physics in some sense protects itself

185
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,410
in that these quantum interference
theorems tend to cancel each other out and

186
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,400
completely disappear from the picture.

187
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,179
And we'll actually have to search
really hard in order to find

188
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:51,000
the situation where they
start being essential.

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,330
And in order to see all of this,

190
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,736
let me estimate the typical action
that appears in this equation.

191
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:59,310
So remember that well, at this stage,

192
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,280
we are just talking about particles
bouncing around from these impurities, but

193
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,040
otherwise, in between this sketching,
they are free particles.

194
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,050
So their energy is essentially
just mv squared over 2,

195
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,450
the kinetic energy of a free particle.

196
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,010
And therefore, in order to estimate
the action, we can just say that well,

197
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,780
by the order of estimates
is going to be mv,

198
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,190
which is momentum, times another
velocity times dt, which is sort of.

199
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,260
So this is going to be the double
length of the trajectory, and

200
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,760
this is going to be the typical momentum.

201
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,750
So we can estimate our
action on each path as

202
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,480
the typical momentum of an electron times
the typical length of the trajectory.

203
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,460
So, now using this estimate,
we can also estimate the typical quantum

204
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,260
interference terms,
which I described by the sum

205
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,610
of overall pairs of non equivalent
different trajectories, L1 and L2.

206
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,400
And now instead of the action, S, we
write explicitly at the typical momentum,

207
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,490
which by the way is called
Feynman momentum divided by h

208
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:10,240
bar times the difference in length between
the two trajectories under consideration.

209
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,160
Or we can write it equivalently as the
cosine sum over all L1, not equal to L2,

210
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,910
cosine of typical momentum
times delta L divided by h bar.

211
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,430
So it turns out that this argument of
the cosine in the typical metal is

212
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,540
actually very large.

213
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,465
And this is because the typical velocity
of electron in a metal is less than

214
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:38,376
the percent of the speed of light,
which is 100, so

215
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,996
the speed of light,
which still is pretty fast.

216
00:13:40,996 --> 00:13:45,783
And therefore,
the typical wavelength turns out to be

217
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:50,257
less than an anemometer,
10 to the -9 meters,

218
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:56,740
which is usually much more than
the distance between these red dots here.

219
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,340
So I'm just giving you facts.

220
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,350
If something is obvious, it doesn't
follow along the previous discussion,

221
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,850
I'm just giving you certain information.

222
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,704
And the bottom line here is that
the typical wavelength, in some sense,

223
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:10,798
you may think about the electrons
really being a wave, and

224
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:15,186
this wavelength is much, much smaller
than the distance between these red guys.

225
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:17,578
And so the interference terms
are not very important.

226
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:19,613
And how it plays out here is that so

227
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:25,020
this typical ratio of delta L divided by
essentially this lambda is very large.

228
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,699
And so you have different trajectories
contributing to this sum, and so

229
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:32,630
you have cosines of different phases,
completely random phases.

230
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,150
And cosine, as we know,
is the function which can be a positive or

231
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,150
it can be negative, depending so if this
our cosine of phi and this is phi, so

232
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,460
it can be positive or negative.

233
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,290
And so if we completely pick,
if this phase is completely random, so

234
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,090
the average value of
the cosine is going to be 0.

235
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,740
So the terms with different signs of
cosine basically cancel each other out,

236
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,365
and this is exactly what happens
with quantum interference terms.

237
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:01,535
And so, seemingly,
classical physics survives, and

238
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:05,928
we can just completely forget about
this quantum interference phenomenon.

239
00:15:05,928 --> 00:15:08,090
So fortunately, it's not quite the case.

240
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,870
It's almost the case, actually.

241
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,070
In an ordinary disorder,
the main pulse is in three dimensions, but

242
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,060
it's not always the case.

243
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,997
And how the quantum interference
terms sort of appear we can see

244
00:15:19,997 --> 00:15:25,030
by noticing that there is a very
special class of trajectories,

245
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,360
where this organization and
this consolidation doesn't happen.

246
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,803
And these are so-called self crossing
trajectories, which actually,

247
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:36,450
one of those trajectories
is sort of presented here.

248
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,688
So you see there is a loop here when
an electron can actually travel

249
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:47,320
in the clockwise direction, and
this is going to be our path number one.

250
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,613
Or it can decide to travel in the opposite
direction, counterclockwise direction,

251
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:53,970
in which case it's going to
be a path number two.

252
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:57,260
And the two paths,
they're going to be different paths, but

253
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,110
they're going to have
exactly the same length.

254
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,570
And therefore the quantum interference
curves responding to these paths

255
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,340
are going to survive.

256
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,448
Phase difference is going to be 0, and

257
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:11,840
these terms are going to
play out very significantly.

258
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,260
And so this is where we're going to
discuss in the second part of this video.

259
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,280
Now going back a little bit
to physics in order just to

260
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,510
give you an intuition about what
it has to do with conductivity.

261
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,370
So we can sort of intuitively
understand that the easier it is for

262
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,900
an electron to move from an initial
point to some distant final point,

263
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,195
the better this material conducts.

264
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,270
Okay, the battery diffuses,
the battery conducts.

265
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,036
And the classical level, it is just
determined by the true conductivity.

266
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:46,475
On the other hand, the easier for
the electron to return to the same form,

267
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:49,944
the more often it just sort
of goes back and back.

268
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:54,785
So the worse conductor it is, so in some
sense, the probability to have these

269
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:58,740
self-crossing trajectories should
in general, by general arguments,

270
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,275
reduce the conductivity, and this is
exactly what happens in most cases.

271
00:17:02,275 --> 00:17:05,440
And therefore,
it is called so-called weak localization,

272
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,690
basically tries to bring collection
back to where it came from.
