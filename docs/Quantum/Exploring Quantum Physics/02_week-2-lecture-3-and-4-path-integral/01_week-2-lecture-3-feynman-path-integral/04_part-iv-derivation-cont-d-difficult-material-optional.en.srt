1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:05,632
To calculate the remaining metrics
elements, in particular, the metrics

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:09,687
element the first metrics element that we
saw in the previous slide.

3
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:14,599
So let me recall a distinction between the
[inaudible] vector of psi used in the

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,964
direct notations, and the wave function,
psi of x.

5
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:21,070
As it appears, let's say, in the
Schrodinger equation.

6
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:26,200
So the former really represents an
abstract state of the system which is sort

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,430
of unrelated to our choice of describing
it.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,389
So, it sort of doesn't rely on the
particular choice of the coordinates.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,635
Well psi of x is a specific what we call
representation, which is much like

10
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:40,083
coordinates of a vector.
So, the relation between the two is the

11
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,164
full length.
So it's basically matrix elements of psi

12
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:45,620
of x is a matrix element between x and
psi.

13
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,920
You know, and both are abstract vectors
and some Hilbert space.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,888
Now a particular example of this wave
function wave for example is this plane

15
00:00:52,888 --> 00:00:56,830
wave which just grabs the particle.
Moving with a certain momentum.

16
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,232
I don't want to discuss too much the
choice of the coefficient at this stage,

17
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:02,300
we're going to discuss it later in the
course.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,490
In any case, we definitely have seen this
function before and we know it describes a

19
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,948
particle with a given momentum.
Now the question that you're really asking

20
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:16,096
now in relation with this matrix element
It was a, what is, what is the wave

21
00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:19,890
function of a particle with the given
coordinate, let's say x pri.

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,182
So, in order to answer this question we
need to remind ourselves to introduce for

23
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:28,662
those of who[UNKNOWN] know the notion of
the Dirac delta-function which basically

24
00:01:28,662 --> 00:01:32,913
is exactly this.
Matrix elements we're after.

25
00:01:32,913 --> 00:01:38,380
So in order to introduce it, let me recall
a very few, very simple facts from the

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,295
usual linear algebra.
So let's say if we have a finite

27
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:48,703
dimensional vector space with some
cartesian coordinate system and basis

28
00:01:48,703 --> 00:01:54,666
vectors, let's say e1 E2 well in principle
it's every 3 or 4 so the Cartesian

29
00:01:54,666 --> 00:02:00,362
Coordinate system implies that we, the
product, the dot product of two basis

30
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:05,347
vectors, e sub i and e sub g is equal to
zero if they are different.

31
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:09,715
Which means they are orthogonal to each
other or is equal to 1 if this is the same

32
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:12,939
vector.
Which means that the, normal trajectory is

33
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:16,148
equal to 1.
And, so the, symbol, which sort of

34
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:21,692
summarizes, this, relation, is the
chronicer delta symbol, delta IG, which is

35
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:25,464
defined as this.
Of course if we're going to calculate the

36
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:30,958
sum, over all let's say i's, of delta IG,
we're going to have the sum equal to one,

37
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:36,452
just because all of them are equal all,
all these terms are equal to zero apart

38
00:02:36,452 --> 00:02:41,315
from the one we, where I is equal to G.
Now the difference between the sort of

39
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:46,273
simplistic picture of the usual basis
vectors and the usual linear vector space,

40
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:50,561
and the basis vectors in quantum mechanics
in, i-, i-, is that the basis we're

41
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:55,580
dealing now is sort of continual base.
So the basis vectors are really sort of

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,960
some [unknown] vectors which are labeled
by coordinates, and there are infinitely

43
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,894
many coordinates and there's sort of a
continuum space of this coordinates.

44
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:08,625
But if we sort of use the analogy between,
let's say e i, and x, and e g, and x

45
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:13,739
prime, so this product is much like a
[unknown] product of these two vectors.

46
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,640
So using this analogy we can demand,
therefore that if x is not equal to x

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,740
prime, this measured [unknown] and
therefore, this delta function, which is

48
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,010
sort of a continuum version of this delta
symbol, are equal to zero.

49
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,906
And if x is equal to x prime and something
else and so there's something else that is

50
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:37,802
determined by a condition which is very
similar to this condition but now instead

51
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:42,122
of summing over a discreet set of vectors
by i, we have to integrate over a

52
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:46,280
continuum set of vectors labeled by x.
And so these are all possible coordinates

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,489
in one dimensional space going from minus
infinity to plus infinity.

54
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,896
And the corresponding the corresponding
delta function, the integral of the

55
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:56,375
corresponding delta function is equal to
one.

56
00:03:56,376 --> 00:04:02,381
And so therefore, if we try to visualize
this delta function, it's something which

57
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:07,177
is equal to zero everywhere.
So this is our delta of x, and this is x.

58
00:04:07,178 --> 00:04:12,550
So we have something which is equal to
zero everywhere apart from just one single

59
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,670
point where this function is so large, it
has such a huge high peak that the

60
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,320
integral collected from this single peak
gives us a finite result.

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,327
And well, this sort of implies that the
value of this delta function at x equals

62
00:04:27,327 --> 00:04:32,406
x-prime is, is infinity.
And these, conditions are the canonical

63
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:36,903
conditions that determine the Dirac delta
function.

64
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:41,224
Now, this Dirac delta function has many,
properties that can be discussed.

65
00:04:41,224 --> 00:04:46,338
So, I don't have time for that now but let
me just mention one important property,

66
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:50,392
which is essentially the Fourier transform
or the delta function.

67
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:54,182
So we, we, know that any reasonable
function and, in this case, actually,

68
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:58,987
unreasonable function too can be expanded
in terms of these sort of, plain wave like

69
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,832
functions.
And this expansion is called the Fourier

70
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:05,223
transform so if you the Fourier transform,
the DIrac delta function.

71
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:11,052
It will look like that so essentially an
integral from minus infinity to plus

72
00:05:11,052 --> 00:05:16,252
infinity of dk over 2 pi either for ikx.
So these are well, things that we need now

73
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,974
to calculate the remaining matrix
elements.

74
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:21,274
So, one of them in some sense have already
calculate.

75
00:05:21,275 --> 00:05:26,990
So let me just put everything together and
clean up this space a little bit.

76
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,760
So, one matrix element that we can
immediately write down a by analogy with

77
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,898
this relation we just arrived is the
matrix element between the neighboring

78
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:44,385
points x sub k and x sub k plus 1, which
can be written just in one to one

79
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:50,137
correspondence with this result.
We just replaced x with xk plus 1 and x

80
00:05:50,137 --> 00:05:56,100
prime with x sub k and we get this delta
function of the difference which we'll

81
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,370
also call later on delta x.
Now, in a very similar way.

82
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:07,320
We can now calculate, also, the, matrix
element of the, potential, v of x.

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,120
So since v has the potential depends on
the, on the coordinate.

84
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,250
And this vector, this state vector is the
eigenstate of the coordinate.

85
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,985
Means that v of x, when acting on the x
sub key just gives us.

86
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:27,386
The number v of x of k which can be
factored out and the remaining matrix

87
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:31,877
element we just calculate it so the result
is simply this.

88
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:38,676
So a slightly less trivial matrix element
appears from the kinetic energy where we

89
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:44,505
have to calculate the matrix element of
the p squared over 2m and So the x of k is

90
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:50,256
not and eigenfunction of momentum p.
So in order to calculate it, do we can use

91
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:55,500
again the resolution of the identity that
we discussed before, but now formulated

92
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,543
for the momentum rather than for
coordinates.

93
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:03,234
So this guy is equal to 1.
And we can insert this resolution of the

94
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:08,527
identity in between this operator p
squared over 2m and x sub k, and if we do

95
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:12,424
so we get this integral.
So here are placed the dummy variable of

96
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:15,959
integration.
Instead of writing it as p here, I just

97
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,977
write it as p sub k, and, but it's the
same resolution of the identity.

98
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:25,958
And so here now, so the, momentum
operator, this kinetic energy, does act on

99
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:30,064
its eigenstate.
So therefore this becomes simply P

100
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:34,817
sub-case squared over 2m, which is a
number that can be factored out.

101
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:39,726
And there are many matrix elements this
guy and this guy has to be compared, has

102
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,350
to be compared with this expression with
the plain wave.

103
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,619
So these are simply plain waves.
And so if we put everything together for

104
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:51,714
this room, we get the following results
with the matrix element of the kinetic

105
00:07:51,714 --> 00:07:55,619
energy.
So which involves an integral o over a

106
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:58,820
momentum.
In this case p of k is the momentum.

107
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,780
So in order to write all measuring
supplements in a similar fashion we can

108
00:08:04,781 --> 00:08:11,742
use this now this relation for the delta
function which with the fourier transform

109
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:16,682
put the delta function and just replace
key with a p over e bar.

110
00:08:16,682 --> 00:08:22,870
So if we do so, we get essentially the
same integral but now, integrate it over a

111
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,977
momentum and the exponential here will,
will i over each bar, p sub p times x.

112
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:33,889
So but it's essentially the same the same
expression for the delta function and we

113
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,719
can use it here to write the matrix
element in terms of this in terms of this

114
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,030
integral.
So you see that all three metrics elements

115
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,022
that appear in the in our previous
calculation can be written in a very

116
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:51,922
similar fashion.
Now, the good news is that we have reached

117
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:57,214
our final slide and we are now in the
position to put everything together and

118
00:08:57,214 --> 00:09:03,444
well, get to the main result of Feynman.
We have done in the previous slide, we

119
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:09,905
have calculated the, the matrix elements
that we need to, to describe the

120
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:13,917
propagator and so these are these matrix
elements.

121
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:16,890
So we write them sort of in the uniform
fashion.

122
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,312
So the, there is this one coming from his
term and there is a kinetic and potential

123
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:25,746
energy from the cumulitonian.
Now why, let's recall why do we even

124
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:29,162
bother you know to think about this
[unknown] element.

125
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:35,098
So, where it comes from is really the this
sort of picture of the propagators.

126
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:41,762
So remember we want to find the propagator
from an initial point xi or 0 to the final

127
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:47,402
point xf and a time t.
And so what we did, we split the time

128
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:54,134
interval from 0 to t into n a very, very
small time intervals delta t and in doing

129
00:09:54,134 --> 00:10:00,764
so we have represented our initial
propagature as a product essentially of

130
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:07,596
this small propagature.
Going let's say from this point to x1,

131
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:13,110
from x1 to x2 etc., etc.
And so basically to calculate this, this

132
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:18,659
many matrix elements you know to calculate
the 0 without the delta t, we needed to

133
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,730
calculate this guy and so we have the
answer.

134
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,769
So this is the expression.
And now we can just use it.

135
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,368
So notice the good thing about this
expression.

136
00:10:27,368 --> 00:10:30,789
Well, it looks a little bit cumbersome,
but the good thing about this expression

137
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:32,867
is that it doesn't have any operators any
more.

138
00:10:32,868 --> 00:10:34,760
The operators are gone.
There are no hats here.

139
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,955
There are only numbers, the regular
numbers we're used to.

140
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:42,856
So another thing we should, we can notice
is that this time interval, delta t, is

141
00:10:42,856 --> 00:10:47,072
very small, because we try and keep our
Interval from 0 to 10 to n pieces and n

142
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:50,270
goes to infinity, so this guy is really,
really small.

143
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,750
At this point what we can recall is
the[UNKNOWN] Taylor expansion for an

144
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,979
exponential of some small number.
So if we have a small number, let's say

145
00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:01,120
epsilon much smaller that 1.
So the exponential can be written as 1

146
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,190
plus epsilon, we can neglect the other
terms.

147
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,562
So what Feynman does at this, at this
stage, he notices that, well this term

148
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:13,019
here is a small, much like, the epsilon
here.

149
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,260
And he uses this, Taylor Expansion sort of
backwards.

150
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,365
So instead of writing the exponential as a
liner.

151
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:21,910
Well, 1 plus a linear term.
He write this 1 minus a linear term, is an

152
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:26,233
exponential.
So, and, This is the, result that he has.

153
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:31,200
So the reason he does that is because now
the integral that we get is very

154
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,790
convenient.
Because this is really the Gaussian

155
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,542
integral that we know how to calculate so
you see we have this, we have an integral

156
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:41,462
over momentum, we have a programmatic term
and a linear term and this is something we

157
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:44,310
have seen before.
So if we do the calculation of the

158
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,700
integral so what we'll going to get is
this.

159
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:53,840
So just, you know, the result of
exponential m over 2 delta x squared over

160
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,818
delta t squared.
But now let's look again at this picture

161
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:01,738
which shows the trajectory.
So you see these are these trajectories

162
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:06,277
that, various trajectories that go from
the initial point to the final point.

163
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:10,624
And so here, this term sort of corresponds
to a single segment, let's say this guy.

164
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:17,128
Where a delta t is this small dimension.
And delta x is really the change in the

165
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:20,236
coordinate.
Well, basically, you may think about the

166
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:23,520
distance that the particle propagates in
this time delta t.

167
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,004
So delta x or delta t simply, can
interpret as simply the velocity of the

168
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:31,629
particle.
So therefore, if we write it, so we, we

169
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:37,219
can see that this matrix element is
nothing but either the power I over H, MV

170
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:43,239
squared over two, so basically the kinetic
energy minus the potential energy times

171
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:47,740
Delta T.
So and this is something which has a name

172
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:55,090
in classical physics, so maybe some of you
know it, and this Name is called the

173
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,557
Lagrangian.
Let me call it L sub k.

174
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:04,595
And so in these notations we can write the
result for the matrix element of U of

175
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:07,714
delta T is simply E to the power of I over
H bar.

176
00:13:07,715 --> 00:13:15,114
L sub k times delta t.
So using this result we can now rewrite

177
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:19,910
our main object this propagature as
follows.

178
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,932
So we're going to have a bunch on
integrals over x1, this point, this point,

179
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:27,938
this point.
Uih, and of this exponentials of this

180
00:13:27,938 --> 00:13:31,066
Lagrangians.
First point it was at the first segment,

181
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:36,316
second segment thir segment etcetera.
So notice that eseentially these integrals

182
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:40,537
over X1, X2 etcetera sort of correspond to
moving aroudn these poitns tehse

183
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:44,030
intermediate points between Xi and Xf.
The endpoints.

184
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,690
Are completely fixed.
But the intermediates intermediate points

185
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,046
are free.
And these integrals essentially symbolize

186
00:13:51,046 --> 00:13:54,378
this freedom.
So now the last step here in the

187
00:13:54,378 --> 00:14:00,328
continuation is you have to recognize
that, so here the product of exponential,

188
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:05,149
it can be written of the exponential of
the sum, i over h bar.

189
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:12,696
L sub k delta t.
And as delta t the interval, time interval

190
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:19,640
goes to zero, we can simply write it as e
to the power i over h bar, an integral

191
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,658
well from 0 to t l d t.
And the integral of the Lagrangien over

192
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:28,119
time is called is known as classical
action.

193
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,295
So what we got is essentially the main
result that the propogator can be written

194
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:39,398
as an integral over all possible
trajectories, all possible intermediate

195
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:44,760
coordinates of the weighted with this
exponential of the classic election.

196
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,758
So this is the result that we sort of
advertised in the very beginning.

197
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:53,372
And Feynman introduced essentially a
symbol, a notation, instead of writing a

198
00:14:53,372 --> 00:14:59,662
bunch of these Intermediate step, so if
you can introduce a single symbol which is

199
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:04,608
this capital curly d of x of t which is
called the path integral.

200
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:08,689
So, it's just a symbol.
But it turns out that it's actually a very

201
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,500
convenient symbol.
So now our derivation is over so this is

202
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,416
again, this is the main result, so maybe
let me just write it.

203
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:19,542
Sort of underline it again, so this is our
main result.

204
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:24,414
And so, I know it's been a very long
derivation, but as we'll see in the next

205
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:29,202
lecture, so this result is extremely
useful in that, it will allow us to get,

206
00:15:29,202 --> 00:15:34,750
well from now on, without extraordinary
calculations, extremely profound and

207
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,045
interesting physical facts.
So we're going to discuss the

208
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:43,961
correspondence between classical and
quantum mechanics.

209
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:46,998
We're going to discuss so called quantum
localization, we're going to discuss a

210
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:49,070
very interesting process of quantum
dissipation.

211
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,937
So there are a lot of cool things that can
be studied now with this object.

212
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:57,098
But well, it did take us a while to derive
it, so hope some of you got the main

213
00:15:57,098 --> 00:15:58,693
points of this derivation.
