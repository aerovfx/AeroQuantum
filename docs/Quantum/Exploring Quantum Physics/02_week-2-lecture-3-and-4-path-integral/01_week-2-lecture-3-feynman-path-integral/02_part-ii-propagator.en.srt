1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,650
Now we're going to proceed with
a more technical discussion and

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:08,020
derivation of Feynman's ideas,
the Feynman path integral.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,820
And I should mention here from the outset,

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,580
that if you're not interested
in these technical details or

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,670
if you feel that your mathematical
background is not sufficient to

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,900
follow them very closely, you may simply
skip this and the following segment.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,840
Because the rest of the course
is not going to be heavily

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,400
dependent on this particular derivation.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,450
But otherwise I would encourage to
actually go through this derivation, and

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,740
maybe even work it out on
your own after the lecture.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,660
Because understanding it would help you
develop intuition not only about the path

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:46,480
integral itself but
about quantum mechanics more general.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,290
Now, the object that
we're going to discuss

14
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,506
in this particular segment
is so-called propagator.

15
00:00:54,506 --> 00:01:00,270
Which actually plays an important role
in various aspects of quantum theory.

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,380
But at this level,
we can view it simply as an attempt

17
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,760
to make quantum mechanics
as close as possible

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,820
to the concepts that we understand
intuitively in classical physics.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,020
And these concepts involve, for example,
the notion of a particle localized at

20
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,140
a point in space and the notion of
trajectory that the particle follows.

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,440
Now, at the operational level, what it is,
it involves the following constructions.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,080
So let's assume that at an initial
moment of time equals zero,

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,750
our quantum particle was localized in the
vicinity of the regional point R-sub-i.

24
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,485
So by localized, I mean that its
initial wave function psi(0),

25
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:49,885
t equals 0, is equal to R-sub-i,
this [INAUDIBLE] vector which represents

26
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:55,610
the eigenvector of the position operator
in corresponding to this point.

27
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,850
Or in physical terms, it means that
this wave function is a very narrow wave

28
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,530
packet, localized in
the vicinity of this R-sub-i,

29
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,260
very similar to the wave packet that
we saw in the very first lecture,

30
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,930
in the last segment of
the very first lecture.

31
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,870
And so
this initial state is going to evolve

32
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,820
under the action of
the Schrodinger equation.

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,640
Which is the standard Schrodinger
equation with some kinetic energy and

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,060
potential energy.

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,840
And as we know from the first lecture,
so this quantum

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,720
evolution will involve spreading
out of this wave packet with time.

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,705
So instead of a localized
sort of particle like entity,

38
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:35,453
it's going to become like a cloud
surrounding this R-sub-i and this is

39
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:39,660
spreading out occurs in a very nontrivial
fashion the presence of potential.

40
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,440
Now the question that we're going to ask,
and

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,160
which brings us to this notion
of a propagator, is what

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,320
part of this particle will propagate
to a certain final point R-sub-f.

43
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,778
Or in other words,

44
00:02:56,778 --> 00:03:02,347
what part of this spread out wave
packet will be located near this point?

45
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:08,117
And this mathematically implies
calculating the overlap between the final

46
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:14,250
wave function psi(t), which again is
governed by the Schrodinger equation,

47
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:20,910
and this R-sub-f which describes a wave
packet near some other final point.

48
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,750
So of course I don't want to give you
the impression that the particle literally

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,280
propagates from one localized
state to another localized state.

50
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,798
It does not, it actually spreads out
in the quantum mechanical language.

51
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:38,192
But a part of this wave packet will
indeed be located near this point,

52
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:41,580
and this is what we want to calculate.

53
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,130
And this overlap is the propagator
that we're going to focus on.

54
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:52,030
Now, another question we may ask is
how will the particle get there?

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:57,910
How will the particle go from the initial
point to this partially final point?

56
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,229
So this question, strictly speaking,
doesn't really make sense in the context

57
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:05,809
of the standard quantum theory
based on the Schrodinger equation.

58
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:10,776
Because there is really no notion of the
trajectory which implies the ability to

59
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:14,184
manage your momentum and
coordinate at the same time,

60
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:17,020
which is not possible
in quantum mechanics.

61
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,045
But as we will see in this
different formulation by Feynman,

62
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:24,515
so this question sort
of acquires a meaning.

63
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:29,705
And going to get ahead of ourselves,
let me reiterate or advertise again,

64
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:36,235
that what we are going to find is that
this particle goes from this initial point

65
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:41,305
to the final point for the all possible
trajectories that we can possibly imagine.

66
00:04:41,305 --> 00:04:45,527
So here are a few of those
trajectories that I plot.

67
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:52,073
Right, now, to move on to actually
calculate this overlap to this propagator,

68
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:58,940
clearly what we need to find is, well,
the final wave function of psi(t).

69
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,820
We know the initial condition, we know
what the final state we want to get.

70
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,010
Now we need to, well actually,
solve the Schrodinger equation,

71
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,690
which in general is very complicated, but

72
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:15,080
there is a formal solution we can write
using the so-called evolution operator.

73
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,236
So we're interested in solving
the general Schrodinger equation here,

74
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:25,119
with some initial
condition at t equals zero.

75
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,518
So I assume that we know the wave
function at the initial moment of time.

76
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:34,109
So this of course, is a completely
general formulation which is not

77
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:37,572
specific to derivation of
any path integrals, but

78
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:40,631
well, in our case of
the initial condition,

79
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:46,160
we have chosen to be this localized wave
bracket near a certain point R-sub-i.

80
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,947
So in any case, well,
to solve the Schrodinger equation,

81
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:52,982
this time-dependent Schrodinger equation,

82
00:05:52,982 --> 00:05:57,858
basically means to find the wave
function as a function of time, psi(t).

83
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:02,235
And the evolution operator
that I just mentioned,

84
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:09,200
is formally relates the initial condition
to the final wave function psi(t).

85
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,860
So its action is exactly, in some sense,
rotation from psi(0) to psi(t).

86
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:21,671
I use the word rotation, having in mind
this geometric picture that we introduced

87
00:06:21,671 --> 00:06:27,805
last week to motivate the direct
notations of this calculated psi(t).

88
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:32,920
Which in sums,
are meant to represent an abstract vector,

89
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,382
in a linear vector space, responding
to the state of the physical system.

90
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:46,488
Now if we did have a garden variety
linear vector space as our Hilbert space,

91
00:06:46,488 --> 00:06:53,610
which normally is very multidimensional so
we can't really draw the axis.

92
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:59,366
But if we imagine for
a second that we have, let's say,

93
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:03,777
just three axis and there is a state psi0,

94
00:07:03,777 --> 00:07:07,709
which represents out initial state.

95
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,721
So the norm of this vector, so

96
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,713
the absolute value squared of this
vector sort of corresponds to the total

97
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:19,180
probability of finding our quantum
particle in a certain state.

98
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,590
And well, from the Born interpretation,

99
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,370
we can say that this
probability is equal to 1.

100
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,520
We will find the particle,
if it's there, in some state.

101
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,810
So the norm of this vector
should be preserved as we

102
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,950
perform a quantum evolution.

103
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:37,940
So in some sense, the only thing we can
imagine this vector doing as a function of

104
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,475
time under the action of
the Schrodinger equation,

105
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:47,105
is rotation by some angle to
a certain new state psi(t).

106
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,810
And this rotation, the operator which
sort of enforces this rotation,

107
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,660
is exactly this evolution operator.

108
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,185
Again, so here I'm just trying
to represent this in an intuity.

109
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:02,180
If we, in general, are dealing with
a generic quantum mechanical problem,

110
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,860
there is no way to draw it, because we
have, well, an infinitely dimensional

111
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,300
Hilbert space, but still at some
level this picture is preserved.

112
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,090
So this evolution operator
rotates a normalized state,

113
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,100
which describes a particle two different
states, we describe the same particle.

114
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Now, it turns out that we can actually,

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,210
instead of writing the Schrodinger
equation for the wave function, we can as

116
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,080
well just write the same Schrodinger
equation for the evolution operator.

117
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,970
The only thing we have to
do is just to plug in this

118
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,872
equation into the Schrodinger equation.

119
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:41,920
We're are going to see that we have
essentially the identical equation for

120
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,930
the evolution operator.

121
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,527
So HU(t), and the initial condition for

122
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:52,867
this equation is U(0) is equal to 1,

123
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:57,221
where 1 is just the identity operator.

124
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:58,221
So why?

125
00:08:58,221 --> 00:09:02,701
Well, it sort of follows in a very
simple way from its definition.

126
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:04,343
So if we look at this equation,

127
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:08,892
we see that the evolution operator evolves
our initial condition to final state, but

128
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:12,890
if t is equal to 0, there is nothing
to evolve, we just stay where we were.

129
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,516
And so therefore,
if psi(0) is equal to psi(0), so

130
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:21,040
U(t) is equal to 1, and this is
the initial condition we can enforce.

131
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,530
And one can guess in some sense, or

132
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,660
just pick a general solution to
this matrix or operator equation,

133
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:35,128
which satisfies both the Schrodinger
equation itself and the initial condition.

134
00:09:35,128 --> 00:09:40,820
By writing U(t) as an exponential

135
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,388
of minus i over h bar h times t.

136
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:50,212
So well, if t equals 0,
e exponent of 0 is equal to 1,

137
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:54,631
so thus it is why the required
initial condition and

138
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:57,539
if we plug it into this equation.

139
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:03,079
So if we differentiate
this with respect to time,

140
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:13,707
So while differentiating the exponential
pulls out this coefficient,

141
00:10:13,707 --> 00:10:15,835
minus i over h bar times h.

142
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:20,345
So, minus i times i is equal to
1h divided by h is equal to 1.

143
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:23,675
So we're just going to have HE to the bar,

144
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:30,400
minus ih bar, H times t which
indeed is equal to H times U.

145
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Therefore, indeed so we satisfy
the required Schrodinger equation.

146
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,959
So an interesting and attractive feature
of this evolution operator is that

147
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,950
it solves the Schrodinger equation with
all possible initial conditions in one go.

148
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,180
Because the evolution operator
itself does not actually depend on

149
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,060
the initial conditions.

150
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,936
So we see that it has
a universal initial condition.

151
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:58,060
And t equals 0, U is equal to 1.

152
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,716
So for instance here in the geometrical
interpretation if we have, let's say,

153
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:08,974
different psi(0), let's say this
will be psi(0), well, prime.

154
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:15,211
So the evolution of this other initial
condition in this sort of Hilbert space,

155
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:19,865
would be a rotation by the same
angle around the same axis but

156
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:21,930
to a different psi(t).

157
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,758
Lets say, psi(t) prime here,
but the evolution operator that

158
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:31,590
would enforce this rotation will
be exactly the same as before.

159
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,290
So it'll be exactly the same U(t).

160
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,500
So in our case in particular, so
we're interested in knowing how

161
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,150
this particular initial
condition evolves with time.

162
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:50,100
And therefore the wave function would
be equal to e to the power minus i

163
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,230
over H, Hamiltonian times time
acting on this initial condition.

164
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,960
So this is a exact and

165
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,770
universal solution of the Schrodinger
equation, whatever it is.

166
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,597
With this and

167
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:07,480
you show condition of a localized
particle in a certain region in space.

168
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,050
Now let us go back to
the main question that we

169
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,160
posed in the beginning of this segment.

170
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Namely, the question about the overlap

171
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,841
between the wave function
psi(t) propagated

172
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:27,050
from the vicinity of the point R-sub-i and

173
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,845
wave back it localized in
the vicinity of the point R-sub-f.

174
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:38,030
So, what we found in the previous
slide is a formal exact expression for

175
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:38,873
this sub psi(t).

176
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:43,335
Sub psi(t) is the action of
the evolution operation on the initial

177
00:12:43,335 --> 00:12:46,858
condition R-sub-i, and
therefore if you put 2 and

178
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:50,144
2 together the expression,
or the propagator,

179
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:54,388
is going to be the following matrix
element, it's going to be Rf.

180
00:12:54,388 --> 00:13:01,720
Here we're going to have this
evolution operator, Ht R-sub-i.

181
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,545
So this guy is simply this Psi(t).

182
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,507
And so
we get the expression that we're actually

183
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:15,526
going to use in the next segment to
derive the Feynman path integral.

184
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:20,107
So Feynman path integral is another
representation of this matrix

185
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:23,800
element between Rf and
Ri with this operator U(t).

186
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:29,010
So at this stage you may ask me,
why would we bother to look for

187
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,570
any other expression for the propagator
apart from the one we just derived,

188
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,060
which looks pretty compact and simple?

189
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,920
So the answer to this
is that the simplicity

190
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,730
is deceptive because the main object here,
this evolution operator,

191
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,950
involves exponentiating an operator,
the Hamiltonian.

192
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,240
And to actually calculate such
an exponential of an operator,

193
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,240
exponential of a matrix,
is a rather complicated exercise.

194
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,060
And in general,

195
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,210
even to define the exponential of
an operator is a tricky business.

196
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,830
So as a side comment here, let me remind
you that for an arbitrary operator,

197
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:14,110
a matrix X, in our case this
X is minus i over h bar Ht.

198
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,750
So its exponential is
defined by the Taylor series.

199
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,184
So it's 1 plus X, plus X squared over 2,

200
00:14:22,184 --> 00:14:26,630
plus X cubed over 3 factorial plus, etc.

201
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:32,339
And so to calculate this series with
matrices operator is rather complicated.

202
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:38,850
And so the Feynman approach is, as we will
see, essentially circumvents the need to

203
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,920
calculate this complicated exponential and
from case this series right here.

204
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,070
And basically the end result,
as we will see,

205
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,070
will be an expression that doesn't
have any operators whatsoever.

206
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,990
And not only that, the final result
also will have a very clear, intuitive

207
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,279
interpretation that we already advertised
in the beginning of this lecture.
