1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,350
In this video, I'm going to complete
the most technically demanding part of

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,138
the derivation of a path
integral representation for

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:13,288
the propagator that was introduced
in the previous segment.

4
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:20,430
And here again I show the expression for
this propagator that we derived.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,110
So in the following, I'm going to be doing
my calculations mostly in one dimension,

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,070
for the sake of simplicity.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,870
There is no real reason to go to one
dimension, so the calculation sort of

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,140
goes the same way in two dimensions or
three dimensions or 100 dimensions.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,460
It's just going to one dimensions is just
simplifies notations a little bit so

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,730
we don't have to deal with vector indices.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,210
And also it will allow me to

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,230
illustrate certain steps of our derivation
in a sort of intuitive, pictorial way.

13
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,380
So the second comment I would like to
make is that what we call the propagator

14
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,180
also appears in the literature under
a name of transition amplitude, well,

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:04,050
from an initial point x i to
a final point x f, in this case.

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,250
And a very closely related object
is also called the Green function.

17
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:15,082
So if you see these expressions in the
literature, they may be actually very much

18
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:19,148
related to one another and
all refer to this object, essentially.

19
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:24,181
Now the main difficulty in calculating
this object, once again, is

20
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:30,448
the presence of this evolution operator,
which is an exponential of a Hamiltonian.

21
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:35,453
And to calculate this exponential of
an operator is a very tricky business.

22
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:39,916
So basically the goal of the remaining
calculation, as we discussed, is going to

23
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:44,711
be to simplify this expression so that it
doesn't really contain any operators, and

24
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:49,590
we deal with sort of regular
mathematical quantities, not operators.

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:54,170
And in doing this simplification,
we're going to rely on two very

26
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:59,790
useful mathematical, or physical
actually in this case, two formulas.

27
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,990
So one of them, the first one listed here,
we already have actually discussed

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,080
in the second lecture last week.

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,861
So this is the so-called resolution
of the identity operator.

30
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:17,348
And the fact that it is the identity
operator means that, so

31
00:02:17,348 --> 00:02:21,656
let's say if we have an arbitrary
wave function psi, and

32
00:02:21,656 --> 00:02:25,449
we add by this operator on
this wave function psi,

33
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:31,313
On this psi, so
what we're going to get is the following.

34
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:37,931
X sub psi, this matrix elements,
times the key of extra x, dx.

35
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,810
And this is identically
equal to the psi itself.

36
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,363
So this is formula number one.

37
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:50,249
Another equation which is going to be
very useful actually, it's a property of

38
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:53,845
the evolution operator, actually
relies on a very simple observation.

39
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:58,767
So the evolution operator itself
translates the wave function from

40
00:02:58,767 --> 00:03:00,850
the initial moment of time.

41
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,852
So this is time and this is,
let's say, time equals 0.

42
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,537
So to the wave function psi(t),

43
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:10,714
the time at the final moment
of time t equals t as well.

44
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:16,887
But instead of going directly from 0 to t,
we can do that in sort of two steps.

45
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:20,258
We first can go to, let's say, certain t1,

46
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:23,982
which is between 0 and t,
and then go from t1 to t.

47
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:30,399
And going from t1 to t corresponds in
the language of this evolution operator,

48
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:34,805
is applying this operator,
which depends on t-t1,

49
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:39,040
to the wave function that
we have here in the middle.

50
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,070
So on the other hand, the wave function
in the middle, the psi(t1) itself,

51
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:48,700
can be represented as the action
of the evolution operator U(t1) on

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,920
the original wave function psi(0).

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,890
So therefore, what we derive here is
that the evolution operator U(t) can

54
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:04,100
be written as the product of two evolution
operators here of t-t1 times U(t1).

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,539
So the particularly simple way of
splitting the time interval into two,

56
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,172
in this case, is just dividing it in half.

57
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:15,080
So let's say again we have
this time axis of 0 t and

58
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,791
we just divide it into two pieces.

59
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,125
So from 0 to t2 and from t2 to t.

60
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,195
And so
therefore we have the expression for

61
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:29,318
the evolution operator U(t)
is equal U(t/2) times U(t/2).

62
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:35,258
So now if we're going to focus
on the actual propagator

63
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:40,388
which is the matrix
element of this evolution

64
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:45,248
operation between the initial point xi and

65
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:49,298
the final point xf, what we can do,

66
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:55,249
we can write it as xf U(t/2), U(t/2), xi.

67
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:59,045
And insert here the resolution of
the identity that we discussed in

68
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:00,277
the previous slide.

69
00:05:00,277 --> 00:05:04,315
So and if we do so,
we get this expression,

70
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:11,402
which essentially splits the original
propagator into two propagators.

71
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:18,804
One goes from xi to x, and the other goes
from point x to the final point x sub f.

72
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:24,260
This splitting of the original propagator
into two allows a very useful and

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,850
intuitive illustration that I'm
going to present now which will

74
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,120
actually bring us closer to
the notion of a path integral.

75
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,884
So let's say this is my coordinate x and

76
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:41,570
this is time t, and
this is my 0 and final time t.

77
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,646
This is going to be my xi and xf.

78
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:53,900
And so what I am interested in
is calculating the propagator

79
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,445
of going from the initial moment of
time xi to this xf at t equals t.

80
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:06,707
So this is essentially what I'm
calculating, and this sort of solid line

81
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:12,680
connecting the two points sort of
corresponds to my g(xi, xf; t).

82
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,190
Now this equation tells me that

83
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,970
I can take the point in the middle,
so this is going to be my t over 2.

84
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,090
And what I have to do in order
to calculate this propagator,

85
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,980
I have to consider all possible
coordinates in between.

86
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:31,078
So let's say I will go from x i to x and
from x to x f.

87
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,076
This is going to be one path.

88
00:06:34,076 --> 00:06:40,111
Another path is going to be to go to
a different x like so, etc., etc.

89
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:44,457
So these solid lines are going to be
sort of representing the first and

90
00:06:44,457 --> 00:06:47,184
the second propagator in this integral.

91
00:06:47,184 --> 00:06:55,660
And, well, obviously, this procedure of
splitting the original time interval and

92
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,260
position interval into
two can be continued.

93
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:06,200
So what I can do, I can keep on truncating
my time interval into smaller and

94
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,650
smaller pieces, and when I will
continue doing so I will have more and

95
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,860
more intermediate coordinates
that are going to appear.

96
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,600
And therefore, I will generate all
possible trajectories that they're

97
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,910
going to cover the entire space here.

98
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,510
And this is how path integral or
integral over trajectories really appears.

99
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:26,790
But at the level of this illustration,
this path integral,

100
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,710
this picture is not very useful for
practical purposes.

101
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,870
To make some progress here, so
let me formalize what I just said.

102
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,572
And what I said is simply
the fact that let me just split.

103
00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:41,740
Instead of splitting my time
interval into two pieces,

104
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,350
let me split it into N pieces, so
N here is going to be very, very large.

105
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:54,065
So that t over N, each individual
time interval, is extremely small.

106
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:56,965
And so each of these small time intervals,

107
00:07:56,965 --> 00:08:00,625
the evolution operator on each of these
time intervals corresponds to this

108
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,895
exponential e to the bar i over h bar,
h, t over N.

109
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:08,975
So this t at t over N I can
make as small as I want.

110
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:13,633
So and if I make it really, really small,
so instead of writing the full

111
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:18,388
Taylor series for this exponential,
I can write it as simply two trims.

112
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:22,089
1 minus the first linear trim, and
just to truncate my series right here.

113
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,860
And so basically approximate my evolution

114
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,164
operator in each of these
time intervals as so.

115
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:39,737
So as a matter of fact, you can say that
I shouldn't have done this derivation,

116
00:08:39,737 --> 00:08:45,274
because at the end of the day
what I have actually derived is

117
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:52,054
that e to the power -i over h bar h times
t is equal to 1 minus i over h bar,

118
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:57,047
h, t over N to the power N,
where N goes to infinity.

119
00:08:57,047 --> 00:09:01,480
And this is actually an alternative
definition of the exponential.

120
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,790
And this is absolutely correct.

121
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,840
This is all there is.

122
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,740
Instead of writing the complicated
non-linear function or

123
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,600
exponential of an operator as a
complicated function, we're just going to

124
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,910
write it as a product of a function
which are linear in our Hamiltonian.

125
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,140
And as we do so, in between each
of these terms in this product,

126
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,190
I'm going to insert my favorite
resolution of the identity.

127
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,240
So this dx, x, x.

128
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,595
And well, since I have many x's now so
I'll have to label them differently.

129
00:09:32,595 --> 00:09:37,611
So there's going to be x1, x2,
x3, which will sort of correspond

130
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:42,637
to these intermediate coordinates
that I have in my trajectories.

131
00:09:42,637 --> 00:09:47,969
Now if we put everything together,
we get this complicated looking

132
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:52,927
expression for the propagator,
which is obtained by, well,

133
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:58,932
sort of sandwiching this product of
evolution operators between xi and xf.

134
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:04,478
And here I'm also going to be using
the notation x0 is the initial one and

135
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:07,020
x sub n is going to be the final one.

136
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,261
So this will allow me to write this
propagator in a more compact way.

137
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:15,564
And also, as I mentioned,
so in between of each of

138
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:20,537
these sort of small evolution operators
for a small time t over N or delta t.

139
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,665
So I insert this resolution
of the identity, but

140
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:28,015
I have to distinguish different
instances where I have to do so, and

141
00:10:28,015 --> 00:10:31,013
therefore have so
many different integrals.

142
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,614
Now the reason again,

143
00:10:32,614 --> 00:10:38,511
I'm doing this is because instead of
dealing with this complicated exponential,

144
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:43,398
I now can deal with these linear
matrix elements of the Hamiltonian,

145
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:47,546
which can be calculated in
a rather straightforward way.

146
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:51,097
So just to summarize what
remains to be calculated,

147
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:56,180
if you just look at this expression,
is, well, simply the matrix element

148
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,124
between x sub k+1 and x sub k and
the matrix element of the Hamiltonian.

149
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:04,877
So all these guys, i, h bar,
N, and t, are numbers, so

150
00:11:04,877 --> 00:11:07,790
they don't really act on these functions.

151
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,050
And the Hamiltonian itself, of course,

152
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,905
is just basically the operator
corresponding to the energy.

153
00:11:15,905 --> 00:11:19,202
And it has the kinetic energy part and
the potential energy part.

154
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:25,079
And so, apart from this matrix
element I have to calculate two other

155
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:31,163
matrix elements, which essentially
are the last pieces of the puzzle

156
00:11:31,163 --> 00:11:37,680
that requires to be completed in order
to get this Feynman path integral.

157
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,608
And so in the remaining of this video,

158
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:42,030
I'm going to be calculating
basically these guys
