00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.890
In the first lecture, I introduced
the basics of Schrodinger formulation of

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.470
quantum mechanics, including the key
notion of the wave function.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.025
This is the most commonly used
formulation of quantum theory and

4
00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:14.215
we're going to use it
throughout the course.

5
00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:18.128
We're going to discuss in great detail the
interpretation of the wave function and

6
00:00:18.128 --> 00:00:20.820
proper use of Schrodinger equation.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.510
But today, I would like to give you an
idea about an alternative formulation of

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.470
quantum theory,
using so-called Feynman path integral.

9
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.420
Which, in my opinion, is a very beautiful
formulation of quantum mechanics and

10
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.010
used to Feynman.

11
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.430
I should mention that this material
is almost never taught at least at

12
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.830
the undergraduate level.

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.820
And when it is taught,
it's usually near the end of the course.

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.530
But today,

15
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.920
I will experiment a little bit with this
material and will introduce a try to way.

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.670
And one of the goals here is for

17
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.860
me to tell you that what you read in
regular textbooks and actually here

18
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.100
in this course, is just one way
to think about quantum physics.

19
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.370
The most commonly accepted way
to describe quantum mechanics.

20
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.480
But there are many other ways actually,
some of them don't even include

21
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.600
the notion of a wave function and you
should be aware their existence at least.

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.340
And keep an open mind here and actually
in general whenever you started signs.

23
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.570
The derivation that I'm going to present
later in this segment follows very closely

24
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.150
this paper by Richard Feynman.

25
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.830
Well, a part of the paper, the paper is
much more detailed written back in 1948.

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.094
And this paper is a typical Feynaman,
so if you read the abstract,

27
00:01:39.094 --> 00:01:43.437
the first sentence of the abstract
says non-relativistic quantum

28
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:47.550
mechanics is formulated
here in a different way.

29
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.772
So he suggested the completely new
way to think about things here.

30
00:01:54.772 --> 00:01:59.620
Now, I should mention that well,
notice the date 1948.

31
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.821
So this time was actually
very difficult time for

32
00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:08.840
Feynman, so there is this book
which I would recommend for

33
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.590
you to take a look, if you're
interested in Feynman as a person.

34
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.070
It's called Perfectly Reasonable
Deviations from the Beaten Track.

35
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.480
So this book is real,
there's no shortage of book about Feynman.

36
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.940
But this book is pretty much
a collection of plagiarism that Feynman

37
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.225
throughout his life.

38
00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:30.415
And when you read this book,

39
00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:35.899
when you read these last years going
back to this period, to the 40s.

40
00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:39.447
You see that it was a very,
very painful time for

41
00:02:39.447 --> 00:02:42.390
Feynman because his wife Arlene died.

42
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.990
The high school sweetheart whom he

43
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.520
married died in 1945,
in June of 1945 of tuberculosis.

44
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.960
It was not easy for him

45
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.990
to deal with this, so the last resort
is to bury this feeling very closely.

46
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.410
And despite this difficult time and maybe
the suffering and sort of inspiration,

47
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.100
he came up with a number
of very influential,

48
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.740
very original, very unusual ideas.

49
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.150
And one of those ideas is this
going back to the actual physics.

50
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.460
So I'm going to present an iteration but,
as I mentioned, this derivation

51
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.220
is rarely introduced in the very
beginning of quantum mechanics course.

52
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.420
And one of the reasons here,
of course, is a technical involved.

53
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.999
And furthermore, the end result of
this calculation is actually a new

54
00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:42.745
mathematical object that hadn't even
existed before Feyman wrote it.

55
00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:47.717
And did, mathematicians have
been arguing to this day about

56
00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:52.872
its precise meaning, so there is
some technical issues which exists.

57
00:03:52.872 --> 00:03:58.504
But, for those of you who are not real
interested in these technicalities, again,

58
00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:03.840
I just would like to briefly tell you are
the main ideas without going into math.

59
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.810
So, let us consider a quantum particle
localized at the initial moment of time to

60
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.980
equal zero in the vicinity of
a certain initial point r sub i.

61
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.480
And let's ask the question of
what is the probability for

62
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.560
this particle to reach a final point,
r sub f in a time, t.

63
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.550
So if it were a classical particle,
it would have followed a unique,

64
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.100
well defined classical trajectory,
let's say if we're a free particle,

65
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.880
it would have been just a straight
line connecting two points.

66
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.460
But in general,
it would have been a solution or

67
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.480
the second mutant equation,
or the equations.

68
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.190
But it would have been
a unique classical trajectory.

69
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.580
So the main result of
Feynman in this paper,

70
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.290
is that in quantum mechanics, the particle

71
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.810
goes over all possible trajectories
at the same time in some sense.

72
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.200
So at full is at the classical trajectory,
this trajectory,

73
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.285
any trajectory you can imagine and
there is a weight,

74
00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:15.350
a complex weight associated with the each
trajectory which is the exponential

75
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.960
of i times classic collection
divided by the flying.

76
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.660
So a classical action here, we're
going to discuss it in more detail later.

77
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.878
But just to remind you, the classical
action is an integral from zero to t or

78
00:05:29.878 --> 00:05:33.510
the which is the kinetic energy,

79
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.870
basically nb squared over two,
minus the potential energy times dt.

80
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.210
So this, in classical physics,
the minimum of this

81
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.460
action give rise to the mutant equations
and to classical equations of motion.

82
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.930
In quantum mechanics,
there is no principle of least action,

83
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.890
as Feynman showed, but
all actions are allowed and

84
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:05.030
all of them give rise to some
terms in quantum theory.

85
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.940
Now going back to the probability of going
from the initial point to the final point,

86
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.000
in some sense this probability
can be represented as the sum

87
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.330
over the absolute values squared of
the sum, of all possible classical actions

88
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.670
over all paths that I
labeled here by an index l.

89
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.330
And this sum itself is essentially
symbolically represents what we're

90
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.880
going to see as a path integral, which
will come out of the theorem naturally.

91
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.420
And it's really a very remarkable result.

92
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.890
Now it turns out that again, so the
mathematical part of it is quite subtle,

93
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:48.890
but one can actually solve some
problems just by using this sort

94
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.020
of cartoon picture of
what a path integral is.

95
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.220
And I'm going to give you an example such
as solution, so even if you don't follow

96
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.790
very closely and carefully the derivation
of the mathematical formulas,

97
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:11.103
you can still follow the main
qualitative results later on.
