00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.400
Hello everybody and thank you for
interest in our course in Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.210
In this first introductory video,

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.980
I'm going to give you
an overview of the course.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.200
I'll tell about the course logistics,

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.580
the grading policy and
we'll also will discuss in more detail

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.219
the material that is actually
going to be covered in the course.

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.360
But first of all I would like to
introduce again the instructors that is

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.330
the Charles Clark and
myself Victor Galitski,

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.920
we both are theoretical physicist
working on quantum size at

10
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.890
the Joint Quantum Institute or
just JQI at the University of Maryland.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.840
JQI is a very exciting place where there's
a lot of wonderful signs being done on

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.590
a daily basis but within experimental
physics and theoretical physics.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.680
So there are a number of very talented
students working with us, for

14
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.360
example these two guys here and
this, by the way,

15
00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.910
is a picture of a new building
coming up where JQI will be located.

16
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.750
Both the University of Maryland and
JQI are situated in the Washington,

17
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.050
DC area in the United States, so this
is the beltway surrounding Washington,

18
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.970
DC, and this is the White House here and
we're about five miles or so

19
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.590
from the White House.

20
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.790
So we at JQI are always looking for
intelligent students

21
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.520
to work with us, students and
post doc's so if you're interested and

22
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.860
would like to know more, please visit
our website here and jqi.umd.edu.

23
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.406
Well you can certainly learn
more about the JQI and

24
00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:43.077
about the science that we do by going to
our website and searching the internet.

25
00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:47.276
We on our side, unfortunately,
know very little about you.

26
00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:51.923
So what we do know is that
there are about 25,000

27
00:01:51.923 --> 00:01:56.479
students signed up for
our course, and that's it.

28
00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.578
So there is nothing else we
know about you unfortunately.

29
00:01:59.578 --> 00:02:02.529
So Coursera has your email addresses and

30
00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:07.128
we can use this database to send
you course announcements, but

31
00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:11.901
apart from that, we don't know
anything about your interests,

32
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.240
your expectations for the course,
your future plans, and

33
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.550
it would be very helpful for us to have
a little bit of information about that.

34
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.440
So we'd love to know me and so in this
context, I would like to emphasize,

35
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.310
please complete the survey that you
will find on the class page on Coursera.

36
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.060
It will take you maybe 30 seconds or
a minute of your time to do so, but

37
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.990
it will be very helpful for
us to understand your expectations and

38
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.590
also to gauge the level of the material
that actually will be presented.

39
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.610
So some of the lectures have
already been recorded but.

40
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.890
In the second part of the course,
the second part of the course

41
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.390
hasn't been recorded yet, and so
this information will be really helpful.

42
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.800
So now,
let me talk about the course logistics.

43
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.305
So as you know, this is an 8-week course,
and there will be eight weeks of lectures,

44
00:03:07.305 --> 00:03:10.770
two lectures per week, or
well, 16 lectures total.

45
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.830
I assume you can do the math here.

46
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.736
So each lecture will consist on
the average of four segments,

47
00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.680
so 10-20 minutes each and

48
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.880
this will add up to about two
hours of video content a week.

49
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.870
So there will be a one,

50
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.160
two in-video quizzes in each segment,
those are not going to be graded,

51
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.550
so this is sort of to keep you awake
to make sure you are still listening.

52
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.600
And there will be one homework
every week which will be graded and

53
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.670
there will be seven homeworks total.

54
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.710
And then the last week,

55
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.780
we're going to have a final
exam which also will be graded.

56
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.490
So we'll discuss grading
policy a little later.

57
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.510
So one thing I would
like to emphasize here

58
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.450
under this course logistics is that
there will be discussion forums and

59
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.400
you should definitely take advantage
of these discussion forums.

60
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.350
So if you have any questions or comments
or maybe you find a typo in the lecture or

61
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.070
you want to learn something
because some suggestions,

62
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.500
please use the discussion forum.

63
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.220
So first of all, your fellow students may
be able to help you to answer some of your

64
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.900
questions, or actually, we also will
be monitoring the discussion forums,

65
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.470
keeping an eye on good questions and
good students.

66
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.510
And also we'll have a dedicated student on
our side monitoring the activity there.

67
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.850
So use these discussion forums,
it's very important.

68
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.590
So a little more about our lectures.

69
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.626
So just to remind you,
this is a graduate/advanced

70
00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:43.730
undergraduate-level quantum
physics course,

71
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.839
which automatically implies that
there will be a lot of math involved.

72
00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:52.790
So, and also remember that both your
instructors are theoretical physicists.

73
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.098
We actually don't know anything else but
math.

74
00:04:55.098 --> 00:04:58.215
So be prepared to see quite a lot of math.

75
00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:01.176
But on our side,
we also realized that among you,

76
00:05:01.176 --> 00:05:04.490
among the students who are registered for
our class, so

77
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.050
there are different variations in
the level of mathematical preparation.

78
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.270
So we tried to have different levels,
also, in our lectures.

79
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.940
So some videos are going to be
pretty simple with no math involved,

80
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.880
some videos are actually going to
involve pretty complicated stuff, and

81
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:28.340
we came up with a ranking of our videos by
their level of mathematical complexity.

82
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.010
So you will see maybe one or
two video segments with

83
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.680
three stars which implied that they
do involve very complicated math.

84
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.270
And those will be optional for
everybody, so you don't have wedge them,

85
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.320
it's not going to affect your final grade.

86
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.574
So unless, you're really interested and
you want to go through the details,

87
00:05:46.574 --> 00:05:49.997
you can skip them safely,
it's not going to affect it very much.

88
00:05:49.997 --> 00:05:52.373
But otherwise,
I would encourage you, of course,

89
00:05:52.373 --> 00:05:54.699
to listen to all the material
that we put together.

90
00:05:54.699 --> 00:06:00.500
Now, there'll be quite a few
lectures with two stars,

91
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:07.174
which will involve standard
quantum mechanics advanced math.

92
00:06:07.174 --> 00:06:12.323
So let's say differential equations
where it transforms delta function.

93
00:06:12.323 --> 00:06:16.448
So these kinds of things are going to
appear pretty often in the course.

94
00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:20.906
And in this case, for non-technical
students, so I assume there are quite

95
00:06:20.906 --> 00:06:25.378
a few of you who are, who don't really
want to go through the calculations.

96
00:06:25.378 --> 00:06:26.972
You're just interested in quantum physics.

97
00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:29.468
You've heard something,
you're interested, you think is fun,

98
00:06:29.468 --> 00:06:30.929
you want to know a little more about it.

99
00:06:30.929 --> 00:06:35.281
So in this case, I would suggest that you
definitely should skip the three stars and

100
00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:39.072
you maybe should listen to the beginning
of the lectures with two stars,

101
00:06:39.072 --> 00:06:43.200
which I normally will try to provide
a summary of the results in the beginning.

102
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.194
So that even if you don't
understand all the calculations,

103
00:06:47.194 --> 00:06:49.319
you can still get the main idea.

104
00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.500
So in this case, basically what
I'm saying is that you can listen

105
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.697
just to part of the lectures with
two stars and this would be fine.

106
00:06:57.697 --> 00:07:02.613
Now, there will be lectures with just one
star which will imply that there is some

107
00:07:02.613 --> 00:07:07.259
math involved but it's not really
crucial to understand the main results.

108
00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.822
We may watch it and it's not about math.

109
00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:12.083
It's about some other thing.

110
00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:18.081
So, and finally, there will be lectures
with no ranking in some sense, so

111
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:23.817
those don't really involve heavy math and
anybody can listen to them.

112
00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:26.980
Whether or not you have physics
background or math background,

113
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.560
you still should be able to understand.

114
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.990
Now let me say a few words about the
material you're actually going to learn

115
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:35.470
in this class.

116
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:40.330
So this is the syllabus page for
our course on Coursera.

117
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.290
So you can take a look at it.

118
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.030
So it's available already.

119
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.410
So, let me mention first of all
that we did not even try to cover

120
00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:54.560
all conceivable aspects of quantum
physics in this eight week online course.

121
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.350
I don't think it's possible.

122
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.009
So even when we teach our graduate
students here who already had some

123
00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.090
exposure to quantum physics,
so it takes about a year for

124
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.418
us to over all aspects of quantum physics.

125
00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:08.420
And then there are some advanced
courses on top of that.

126
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:14.020
So, it takes some time to learn quantum
mechanics at the professional level.

127
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.930
But I think we have a very good
selection of topics here nevertheless.

128
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.616
So among them I would like to
emphasize this Feynman formulation of

129
00:08:21.616 --> 00:08:26.301
quantum theory that I personally
like very much, I think it's one

130
00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:31.259
of the most elegant theories developed
by Feynman in quantum theory.

131
00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:36.248
And in the fourth week, we're actually
going to get to a rather modern result,

132
00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:37.967
so quantum localization.

133
00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:42.713
So, we're also going to discuss a little
bit theory of superconductivity

134
00:08:42.713 --> 00:08:47.710
which is another fascinating phenomenon
which relies on quantum science.

135
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.820
So, Charles will start his
lectures in the fourth week and

136
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.240
he's going to talk about the very
important problem of hydrogen atom.

137
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.770
He discuss atomic spectra and present
a solution to the Schrodinger equations

138
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.630
in the Coulomb potential,
it's a very important result,

139
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:10.070
so he'll talk about symmetry and
conservation laws and quantum physics.

140
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:15.029
So later on, actually,
we'll touch upon modern developments,

141
00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:20.163
more modern developments in the quantum
science like say the quantum

142
00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:25.227
hole effect and very modern
developments of multiple insulators.

143
00:09:25.227 --> 00:09:27.445
Some of you might have heard about that.

144
00:09:27.445 --> 00:09:33.235
So in the end of the course, we're
going to talk about other interesting

145
00:09:33.235 --> 00:09:38.242
phenomena, quantum mechanics,
topological vary phase,

146
00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:41.890
quantum optics and
lasers in the last week.

147
00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.770
So the last lecture, we keep it open.

148
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.070
So we don't know yet what's going to
happen in the last lecture,

149
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.810
so it might depend on actually
your interest, your response.

150
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.696
So let's say if you request
something in discussion forums,

151
00:09:57.696 --> 00:10:02.518
we may you see I've to cover in the last
lecture, so we'll see about that.

152
00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:05.980
No, I think it's a very good selection of
topics and you're going to learn, well,

153
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.240
the basics of quantum mechanics and
also some of the advance topics.

154
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.725
So, the last comment here
I'd like to make is that,

155
00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:17.637
when you read in your book on anything,
so, before you get to the action,

156
00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:20.667
it takes some time to
introduce characters.

157
00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:25.459
While sometimes you may
find it a little boring.

158
00:10:25.459 --> 00:10:28.104
Likewise, before we can
get to the actions,

159
00:10:28.104 --> 00:10:30.407
some sense here in quantum mechanics.

160
00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:34.554
It will take me well a few lectures
to introduce the basics to tell,

161
00:10:34.554 --> 00:10:39.518
to remind you or, tell you little more
about the history of quantum mechanics,

162
00:10:39.518 --> 00:10:43.074
how it was actually discovered,
the main equations that

163
00:10:43.074 --> 00:10:48.260
governed quantum behavior and
tell you about the mathematical formulas.

164
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.260
So I would encourage you to keep with me
during this first few weeks before we get

165
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.590
to the interesting stuff which is
going to appear a little later.

166
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.670
Finally, let me talk
about the grading policy.

167
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.840
So I assume that it might
be of interest to many of

168
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.830
you who would like to get
a certificate of accomplishment.

169
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.580
So the grading is going to be
based entirely on your homeworks.

170
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:15.440
There will be seven homeworks each week.

171
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.920
At the end of the week
there will be homework.

172
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.110
And these seven homeworks are going to
contribute 70% to your course grade.

173
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:29.373
And finally, in the last week, there will
be a final exam which essentially is

174
00:11:29.373 --> 00:11:34.796
a long homework which will cover all the
topics we will have studied by that time,

175
00:11:34.796 --> 00:11:39.057
and the final exam will constitute
30% of the course grade.

176
00:11:39.057 --> 00:11:43.818
So each assignment will have
a soft due date where you will

177
00:11:43.818 --> 00:11:48.875
get the full credit for
whatever you have done by that time and

178
00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:54.230
a hard due date, after which no
submissions will be accepted and

179
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.494
there will be some penalty
after the soft due date,

180
00:11:58.494 --> 00:12:03.278
5% per day is I think what's
recommended by Coursera.

181
00:12:03.278 --> 00:12:08.779
Now in the end, we are going to issue two
types of certificates, either regular or

182
00:12:08.779 --> 00:12:14.202
with distinction, and the precise title
for those will be determined later, so

183
00:12:14.202 --> 00:12:19.705
it will be curved based on the performance
of other students, but I would estimate

184
00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:25.490
that regular certificate cut off will be
around, let's say, 60% of the grades.

185
00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:29.020
So you will have to provide
60% of correct answers.

186
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:35.360
And the certificate with distinction
will be at about 90%, so.

187
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.350
But otherwise, I think it will be pretty
democratic sort of grading policy.

188
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.730
And most of you who

189
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.870
make an effort to complete the homeworks
are going to do very well.

190
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:47.620
Okay?
And after all,

191
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.410
if you don't want to do the homework,
it's fine.

192
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.120
If you just want to listen to some
lectures, of course you should feel free

193
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.370
to do so and we understand of course
that you all have busy schedules and

194
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.300
other things to do so just have fun.

195
00:12:59.300 --> 00:12:59.830
Okay?
And

196
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:02.430
I'll see you in the first lecture soon.
