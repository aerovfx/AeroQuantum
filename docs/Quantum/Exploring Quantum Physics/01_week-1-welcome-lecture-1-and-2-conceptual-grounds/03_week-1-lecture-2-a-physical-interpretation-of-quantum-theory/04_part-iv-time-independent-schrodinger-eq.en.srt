1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,330
In this video I am going to elaborate
a little bit on the physical meaning and

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,870
interpretation of operators
in quantum mechanics, and

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,550
in particular we are going to discuss
a very important class of problems that

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,260
appear throughout quantum mechanics
that is, so called, eigenvalue problems.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,890
To see what they are and how they arise
let me first write down the time-dependent

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,790
Schrodinger equation, you can only go
time-dependent Schrodinger equation but

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,460
with specifically with
the time-independent Hamiltonian.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,140
So physically this means
that the potential in which

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,950
our quantum particle is
moving is not time-dependent.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,360
And actually most problems you
are going to see fall into this category.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,470
So it's a very reasonable assumption.

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:50,180
So that neither the mass nor
the potential are time-dependent.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:55,650
So in this case, it turns out there is
absolutely no need to deal with this

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,970
complicated partial differential equation
that involves the time derivative.

15
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,410
So the time-dependence can be factored
out of the equation in a very straight

16
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,840
forward way and this is accomplished by
performing a separation of variables.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,880
So basically what we can say is,
let's look for

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,160
our solution in the following forms.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,052
So the following function is going to be
a product of some time-independent piece,

20
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:28,370
psi(r), and this exponential which is
sort of leftover from the plane wave.

21
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,923
So this psi(r) does not have to be
a plane wave if the potential exists,

22
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:37,303
but it is not a plane if
there is a potential.

23
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:41,140
But the time-dependence
sort of remains the same.

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,070
And so if we plug in this ns into
the Schrodinger equation, so

25
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:50,995
we're going to have in the left-hand side,
the derivative with respect to time,

26
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:58,100
psi(r) e to the minus iEt over h bar.

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,670
So I should mention that E of
course corresponds to the energy.

28
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,060
And so since this lowercase
psi(r) is not depend on time,

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,660
we don't have to differentiate this part.

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,770
We're going to differentiate
just the exponential and

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:17,367
just essentially by construction,
we're going to get in the left-hand

32
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:22,090
side E psi(r) and this exponential.

33
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,560
On the other hand,

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,710
the right-hand side since there is nothing
time-dependent there, simply it reads

35
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,840
the Hamiltonian acting on
the position-dependent part.

36
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,160
And the exponential is also here, but

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,380
it's sort of irrelevant in the sense
that the Hamiltonian doesn't see it,

38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,320
so the Hamiltonian only involves
the derivative with respect to

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,350
spatial coordinates or the potential,
which is just multiplication operation.

40
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,600
So we see that both sides of this
equation contain this exponential, and so

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,020
we can just cancel this exponential.

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,494
And we're left with, let me just switch
the order in which these guys appear.

43
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:06,533
So, we're left with the following equation

44
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:12,112
H acting on psi(r) is
equal to E times psi(r).

45
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:16,301
And this is what is known as
time-independent Schrodinger equation or

46
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,970
stationary Schrodinger equation.

47
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,990
So this category of problems where an
operator acting on a vector in some space

48
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,340
reproduces the same vector
multiplied by some number.

49
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,600
So this category of problems in math
are called eigenvalue problems.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,170
And in the context of
this mathematical theory,

51
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:42,640
psi here represents what's known
as eigenvector, let me write it.

52
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,920
And E is an eigenvalue.

53
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,570
Of the corresponding operator.

54
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,870
In this case this operator is Hamiltonian.

55
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,480
Now let me tell you from the outset,
we shall discuss it in more details later,

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,740
that the physical significance of these
eigenvalues is in that they determine

57
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:09,640
the possible outcomes of experiment that
actually measure, in this case, energy.

58
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,230
So we know that, for instance in
classical physics, if I were to have some

59
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,150
potential will, so
let's say this is my V(x) and there is

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,520
some potential, well just one example of
problems we're actually going to study.

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,550
So if I had a classical particle I would
be able to put a classical particle

62
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,712
with any energy in this field, which
is oscillated between the two turning

63
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:36,630
points if there is no friction, and
I can do so for any value of energy.

64
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,019
It turns out,
in quantum mechanics it's not so,

65
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:46,710
and the range of available
energy is limited in this case.

66
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,150
So then what I would have is
decrease over discrete spectrum

67
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,290
by which I mean a possible
solutions to this equation.

68
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,774
So these levels let's say E1 or

69
00:04:55,774 --> 00:05:00,170
E2 are going to come out
of this eigenvalue measure.

70
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,030
So we see that an eigenvalue problem for

71
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:07,860
the Hamiltonian arises naturally from
the original Schrodinger equation.

72
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,040
And as such, it becomes a very
important independent, in some sense,

73
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,742
equation of quantum theory.

74
00:05:14,742 --> 00:05:18,216
And actually oftentimes when
we say Shrodinger Equation,

75
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:21,480
we're actually referring to
this H psi equals Ep psi and

76
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,430
not to the original one
with the time derivative.

77
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,820
And furthermore, so
I can value problems also appear for

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,200
other operators in quantum theory.

79
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,730
So it's very important, and we should
know at least a few basic properties such

80
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,640
as eigenvalue problems and the operators
involved in these eigenvalue problems.

81
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,278
So we don't have time now to go
into comprehensive theory of this.

82
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,440
Mathematical theories which could be,
in principle,

83
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,290
a subject of a year long course.

84
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,570
So therefore, I will just emphasize
a few things that are really crucial for

85
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,650
the future.

86
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,750
And also introduce some notations and
terms that are important.

87
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,890
So one such important thing is
the notion of a Hermitian operator.

88
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,260
That is defined by the following relation.

89
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,670
So let's imagine we have an operator A,
acting in the space of functions.

90
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:18,200
Psi(r), so I'm not going to define
precisely mathematically what this space

91
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,900
is, but we should just think about wave
functions that describe the properties of

92
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,280
our quantum particles.

93
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:30,049
So, one can define Hermitian-adjoint
operator, Adagger,

94
00:06:30,049 --> 00:06:32,840
to the operator A by
the following relation.

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,780
So the left-hand side of this
equation is essentially identical

96
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,536
to what we saw in the previous
video when we defined an average or

97
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,342
an expectation value of operator A.

98
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:49,292
It's an integral over
the entire space of psi(r),

99
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:54,658
let's say our wave function,
times the action of our operator A on psi.

100
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:58,694
And the operator Adagger moves
from the right to the left, and

101
00:06:58,694 --> 00:07:02,300
now acts on the function
which is a complex conjugate.

102
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,136
So, if the two expressions are equal for

103
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:09,900
any psi(r) then we have found
the Hermitian-adjoint operator.

104
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,016
And an important class of operators
that appear in quantum mechanics,

105
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:18,030
are called Hermitian operators.

106
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,900
And they are characterized by
the fact that their Hermitian-adjoint

107
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,400
is equal to the operator itself,
so they are called Hermitian.

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,670
The importance of the Hermitian
operators manifests itself

109
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,439
if we look at their properties, at the
properties of their eigenvalue problem.

110
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,390
So, in general if we have an eigenvalue
problem for an arbitrary operator there is

111
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:42,241
no guarantee that it's
eigenvalues are going to be real.

112
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,066
So in the context of quantum physics
this would lead to a bit of a problem.

113
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,109
Because, well, let's say,

114
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:55,216
if we have a wave function which is
described psi-sub-a, and we want to take

115
00:07:55,216 --> 00:08:01,640
to measure the expectation value of the
quantity corresponding to this operator A.

116
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,960
So we will calculate this average value
and we're going to get if A is complex,

117
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,260
we're going to get an expectation value,
which is countless.

118
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,860
And in most cases it doesn't make sense.

119
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,620
So, for example, if measure energy for

120
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,960
particle we certainly go on to get I,
the measuring constant I.

121
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,720
We want to get a reasonable number that
has its counterpart in classical physics,

122
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,510
which does not know about complex numbers.

123
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,610
So, what I'm saying here,

124
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,150
is that if we want to describe
physically reasonable quantities.

125
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,340
So we want these operators to
give rise to real eigenvalues, so

126
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,090
this would make sense.

127
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,740
And the Hermitian operators have this
property, exactly this property, so

128
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,440
the eigenvalues of Hermitian
operators are all real.

129
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,770
So another crucial important property
of the eigenvalue problem for

130
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,815
a Hermitian operator is that it's
eigenvectors, these solutions

131
00:08:56,815 --> 00:09:03,190
psi-sub-a(r) to this equation form
a basis in an appropriate space.

132
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,050
So that is the space
where our functions live.

133
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:06,760
So for instance,

134
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,790
in the context of quantum physics,
these are going to be wave functions.

135
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,170
And, of course, I should mention that
the statements I'm making are not

136
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,110
mathematically rigorous statements.

137
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:21,070
So if you want to see a precise
definition or a theorem so

138
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,730
there is, of course, a very rich
mathematical literature the subject.

139
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,150
And I would encourage
you to look into this.

140
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,920
But at this stage I just want to give
you an idea about the properties.

141
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,740
And so the property that I'm presenting
here is, that essentially, if you have any

142
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,140
relevant function psi(r) which has
something to do with our problem.

143
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,480
And this function lives in
the space where our operator x, so

144
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,590
then a set of all eigenvectors of this
operator, which in principle can be either

145
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:52,400
a discreet or continuous, in which case I
would have written an integral even both.

146
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,850
But in any case,
any such wave function can be represented

147
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,090
as a linear combination of
the eigenfunction, so the operator E.

148
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,230
And this has very important consequences,
as I said, in quantum physics.

149
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,970
Now going closer to quantum physics and

150
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,790
further away from mathematical statements,
let me just summarize things that really

151
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:15,350
are important in the context
of quantum mechanics.

152
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,890
So the first statement here
is the physical observables,

153
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,140
essentially things that we want to measure
in quantum mechanics, are described

154
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,150
by Hermitian operators, sometimes
also called self-adjoint operators.

155
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,740
So I should mention that there
exists a subtle difference,

156
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:36,284
actually mathematically, from between
the Hermitian and self-adjoint operators.

157
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:38,760
But it involves rather complicated math.

158
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,750
And in the framework of this course,

159
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,440
we can just consider Hermitian and
self-adjoint to be the same thing.

160
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,830
But if among you there
is some math aficionados

161
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,130
who want to know the difference, ask this
question in the discussion forum and

162
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,368
I would be happy to elaborate on this.

163
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:59,360
But anyways, so if we have
identified a quantity of interest,

164
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,080
our observable a, and identified an
operator associated with this observable,

165
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,700
so then we need to solve
the eigenvalue problem for

166
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,500
this operator and
the available eigenvalues

167
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,900
they determine a possible values that
actually can be measured in experiment.

168
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,682
So also let me reiterate a very important
fact which is discussed in the previous

169
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,078
slide, and we're going to talk a little
bit about this in the next video.

170
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,484
Namely that the solutions to this
eigenvalue problem, this function

171
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:37,570
psi-sub-a(r), form a basis in this
space where our wave functions live.

172
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,240
Which implies that any wave function
describing a physical state of a system

173
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,060
can be expanded as a linear
combination of the eigenvectors.

174
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,610
So the last comment, but not the least
important, that I'm going to make

175
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,030
relates to the interpretation
of these coefficients c-sub-a,

176
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,270
the complex numbers that
appear in this expansion.

177
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,790
As a matter of fact, actually, this is
probably the most important take-home

178
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,490
message I would like you
to take out of this slide.

179
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,480
So imagine that we have an ensemble
of identical quantum systems

180
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,360
which exist in exactly the same quantum
state described by some wave function

181
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,800
psi that we expanded in our
basis of these eigen states.

182
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,730
And let's imagine that we're
going to perform, let's say,

183
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,170
three identical measurements
of the identical quantity a.

184
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,320
So we want to measure
a in exactly the same way

185
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,000
with exactly the same kinds of systems.

186
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,920
So the weird thing about quantum
mechanics is even though

187
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,760
everything is the same about the systems,
we're actually going to get,

188
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,140
strictly speaking,
generally three different results.

189
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,230
So there is a chance some of them will be
the same but there's no guarantee at all.

190
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,750
And the probability of finding
a system in a certain state,

191
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,270
we sometimes refer to as a collapse of the
wave function into a certain eigen state.

192
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:04,320
So this probability,
let me call it w-sub-a,

193
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,050
is equal to the absolute value squared
of the coefficients in this expansion.

194
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,020
So this is the probability.

195
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:22,290
So, in this example again, the only
thing we can say for sure is that all

196
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,480
these measurements are going to result in
a value of a that belongs to the spectrum,

197
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,520
that is to the set of available
eigenvalues of the operation.

198
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,523
But which particularly value
is going to be measured?

199
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:34,238
We don't know.

200
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:38,082
We can only say which is more likely,
and we can quantify this uncertainty but

201
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:40,350
this is the maximum that we can do.

202
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,670
And so this principle is actually very
important in quantum mechanics, and

203
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,290
we're going to use it later
in the course very often.
