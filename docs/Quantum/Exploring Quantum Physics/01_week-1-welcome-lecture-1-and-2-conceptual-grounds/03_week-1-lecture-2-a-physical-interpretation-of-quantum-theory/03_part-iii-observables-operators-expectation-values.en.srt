1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:05,260
In the previous video, we went over
a rather technical mathematical derivation

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,070
of the continuity equation.

3
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:12,460
And this derivation involved
in a rather essential way

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,834
manipulations with the various operators.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,619
The appearance of operators is actually
not specific to the particular problem of

6
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:21,938
continuity equation.

7
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:25,908
But they appear actually throughout
quantum mechanics and play a very

8
00:00:25,908 --> 00:00:30,560
important role, generally, in the
mathematical formulas of quantum physics.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,836
In this short video, I would like to make
a few general comments about operators,

10
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:40,139
and relate them to quantum
observable quantities.

11
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:44,169
So in order for
me to trace the origin of the operator

12
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,668
objects in quantum theory,
let us go back a little bit and

13
00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:54,560
remind ourselves the way
the Schrödinger equation was derived.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,408
So, I use derived here in quotes because
there's no really rigorous way to derive

15
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,828
the Schrödinger equation as a fundamental
equation of quantum theory.

16
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:06,280
But we sort of followed the logic
that the early practitioners such as

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,620
Schrodinger used.

18
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,180
And the first piece of information
which was essential was

19
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,350
the experimental fact that
quantum electrons and

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,859
other quantum particles may
exhibit wave-like properties.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,447
And in order to explain this, we sort
of introduced in that whole question

22
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:28,140
a plane-wave function which would
explain the data essentially.

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,244
And in this wave function we also
introduced the momentum and the energy of

24
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:39,527
the electron, which according to another
piece of information that is known from

25
00:01:39,527 --> 00:01:44,678
the theory, it must be related to one
another using this dispersion relation.

26
00:01:44,678 --> 00:01:49,357
So basically kinetic energy of a free
particle, mv squared over 2 or

27
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:50,749
p squared over 2m.

28
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:57,720
Now the equation itself was
constructed in order to

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,960
ensure that the plane-wave function
would come out as its solution and

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,200
this dispersion relation
would be respected.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,230
And so this is what equation
actually looked like,

32
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,560
and it involved the second
derivative with respect to

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,160
the coordinate in the first
derivative with respect to time.

34
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,930
Now the next step, and this is really
the first time we sort of thought of

35
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:27,300
introducing an operator, was to write
the equation in a different way.

36
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,577
So we had the sort of universal
left-hand side which is just i, h bar,

37
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:33,912
the derivative with respect to time.

38
00:02:33,912 --> 00:02:38,545
And the right-hand side was an sort
of energy operator, the Hamiltonian.

39
00:02:38,545 --> 00:02:43,651
Where we associated with the momentum
that would have appeared

40
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:48,946
in the classical theory, this guy,
which is -i h bar gradient,

41
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:55,710
which indeed is an operator that converts,
well, that acts on the wave function.

42
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,890
And the last step in deriving,
again, in quotes,

43
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,815
the Schrodinger equation was to
generalize this energy operator,

44
00:03:05,815 --> 00:03:11,960
well called Hamiltonian,
from being the free energy operator,

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,170
which is just p squared over 2m to
kinetic energy plus potential energy.

46
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,760
And this is the fundamental
Schrodinger equation,

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,603
which remarkably describes all of
nonrelativistic quantum physics including,

48
00:03:24,603 --> 00:03:28,140
and this describes atomic spectra,
and well,

49
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,930
even many particle systems, theory of
metals, theory of super conductivity.

50
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,540
Everything is contained in a compact
way in this remarkable equation.

51
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,330
And it's sort of also remarkable
that you can get to it from

52
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,460
very few simple experimental facts,
by adding small pieces together and

53
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,530
getting to this fundamental result.

54
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,260
Now but in doing so, we were forced,

55
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,420
indeed, to introduce well
at least three operators.

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,990
So the first one,
we have seen already many times.

57
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,418
It is the momentum operator,
-i h bar gradient.

58
00:04:00,418 --> 00:04:03,227
And by the way I should mention
that the minus sign is really sort

59
00:04:03,227 --> 00:04:05,559
of a convention which is
sort of must be consistent,

60
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:08,590
with the convention we choose to
describe a plane-wave in a sense.

61
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,438
It could have been plus, but
this is the convention that we use.

62
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:20,198
So apart from that we also introduce the
potential energy which enters this h hat.

63
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:21,194
And in this setup,

64
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,190
the potential energy naturally appears
as just multiplication operator.

65
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,663
So we can think about a coordinate
operator, multiplication operator,

66
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:32,691
that well there should be
actually a vector here,

67
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:37,540
multiplication operator,
that simply multiplies the wave function.

68
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,680
And finally, the kinetic energy itself,
sort of the first step, appeared here,

69
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,960
and it was the second derivative
with respect to spatial coordinates.

70
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,665
Now, it turns out that the appearance
of operators was not unique just to

71
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:57,230
this sort of derivation of
the Schrodinger equation.

72
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,096
But sort of they pop up throughout
quantum theory whenever we deal with any

73
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,590
analogs of classical properties.

74
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,020
For example, when dealing with the angular
momentum that in classical theory

75
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,820
is r cross p, so
all we have to do to make it

76
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,780
into an operator is to put a hat actually
on top of the corresponding quantity.

77
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,009
So p here would be replaced with -i
h bar gradient according to this.

78
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,350
And r will just be
multiplication operator, etc.

79
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,640
So we can always find a proper
generalization of classical properties.

80
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:32,740
So that's great.

81
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,375
We established that operators do appear in

82
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,310
the mathematical formulas
of quantum theory.

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,980
And from the mathematical point of
view it maybe quite interesting.

84
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,550
But what physical significance
do these operators really have?

85
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,772
Unlike their classical counterparts, which
can be measured directly in a classical

86
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:57,870
experiment, let's say we can measure
momentum, angular momentum, position.

87
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,760
The operators cannot be measured per se,
they're operators.

88
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,850
So how do we associate
an experimental observable with them?

89
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,410
So in order to answer this question,

90
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:13,960
we're going to use a sort of method
that oftentimes is used in science

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,640
by first answering the question
in a simple special case.

92
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:26,504
And then generalizing the results to
a more general category of objects.

93
00:06:26,504 --> 00:06:30,899
So and the special case that we're
going to consider is the measurement of

94
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:33,180
a coordinate of a quantum particle.

95
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,420
So the Born rule tells us
that the absolute value

96
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,430
of the wave function squared gives us
the probability distribution function

97
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,500
of different positions
of a quantum particle.

98
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,252
Now in general if we have
a probability distribution function,

99
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:54,218
let's say capital F(x) of
some random variable x.

100
00:06:54,218 --> 00:06:59,948
So if we want to find, let's say, the mean
value, the expectation value of this x,

101
00:06:59,948 --> 00:07:04,551
what we're going to do is we're going to
average x, integrate x over all

102
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:09,860
possible values weighted with
this probability distribution.

103
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,585
So in full analogy with this we
can define the mean value of

104
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:20,294
a three-dimensional coordinate by
integrating the wave function,

105
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:25,020
absolute value of wave function squared
with the coordinate over the volume,

106
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,946
over the basically all
three dimensional space.

107
00:07:28,946 --> 00:07:30,820
There is a square here.

108
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,130
So and this is a natural
definition of the mean position.

109
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:40,994
So we can rewrite this definition as so
because absolute value of psi squared,

110
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:44,950
of course,
is simply psi star times psi of r.

111
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,791
So now comes this generalization of
this definition of the expectation

112
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:58,445
value of a coordinate to a general case of
an arbitrary quantum mechanical operator.

113
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:03,405
So let's say we have a classical
property X, let's say, momentum,

114
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,625
angular momentum, coordinate,
energy, whatever.

115
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:11,593
And let's assume we know the quantum
mechanical operator associated with this,

116
00:08:11,593 --> 00:08:12,318
some X hat.

117
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:18,044
So the expectation value of this quantum
observable X is going to be calculated

118
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:23,324
in full analogy with this equation
by simply replacing the coordinate

119
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:28,230
operator in this equation with
the operator X, whatever it is.

120
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:34,605
So for example, if X happens to be, so
let's say if X happens to be momentum,

121
00:08:34,605 --> 00:08:40,199
then we're going to simply write it
the expectation value of momentum

122
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:46,010
is going to be an integral of V star
(-i h bar) gradient of psi, etc.

123
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,720
So it turns out that this
conjecture actually works in

124
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,230
that it is consistent with
the experimental data.

125
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:02,010
And the experimental data implies
that let's say we have an ensemble

126
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:06,451
of quantum systems,
each described by wave-function psi of r.

127
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:13,020
And if we measure some property
X of this quantum systems,

128
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,130
we're going to get different results.

129
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,270
But the average value of this measurement
is going to be consistent with

130
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,400
this definition of the expectation value.

131
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,060
And so it becomes very important and

132
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,890
basic principle of quantum
mechanics that I reiterate here.

133
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,520
Namely that, first of all,
physical observables are associated with,

134
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,980
what I didn't discuss,
self-adjoint operators

135
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,870
acting on the wave-function with
the expectation value defined as above.
