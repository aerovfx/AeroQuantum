1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.072
So now, we will continue putting together
the basic conditional principles of

2
00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:11.812
quantum mechanics, and I'm also going to
introduce the so-called Dirac notations,

3
00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:16.926
which are mathematical symbols Dirac
introduced back in the early days.

4
00:00:16.927 --> 00:00:21.719
And these symbols turned out to be very
convenient in doing calculations in

5
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:26.598
quantum mechanics.
So, let me mention actually that as a

6
00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:32.070
practicing theoretical physicist I noticed
that an important component of a new,

7
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.504
putting together a new physical theory is
to come up with the convenient and elegant

8
00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:41.223
notation.
So, these are not some minor unimportant

9
00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:45.373
questions.
So, it's actually quite important, and

10
00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:50.405
having awkward notations could make our
lives very difficult.

11
00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:54.888
So, Dirac notations certainly satisfy the
criterion of being convenient, and also

12
00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:59.830
they are widely used in the literature.
So, if you don't know them already, it's a

13
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.660
good idea to familiarize yourselves with
the, with them, and this is what we're

14
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.067
going to do today.
But before introducing the Dirac notations

15
00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:14.575
and going further with the development of
sort of more abstract quantum theory, I

16
00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:19.759
would like to mention a relevant
superposition principle in quantum

17
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.150
mechanics.
So, this so called superposition principle

18
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.760
simply states that if we have 2 solutions
to the Schrodinger equation, psi 1 of r

19
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.030
and t and psi 2 of r and t, they are
arbitrary linear combination such as here

20
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.300
with some arbitrary complex constant, c1
and c2, is also a solution to this

21
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.935
equation.
So actually, this so-called superposition

22
00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.195
principle is not specific to the
Schrodinger equation.

23
00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:50.794
The superposition principle holds for any
linear differential equation, which the

24
00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:54.450
Schrodinger equation happens to be.
So, there are no terms between that.

25
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.716
There are no terms like psi squared psi
cubed, etc.

26
00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:02.192
So well, to prove this, one can just
simply plug it into the Schrodinger

27
00:02:02.192 --> 00:02:05.085
equation and cancel the corresponding
pieces, term by term.

28
00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:12.462
So, what this superposition principle
motivates is the notion of so-called

29
00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:20.244
Hilbert space, which is a linear vector
space where quantum states sort of live.

30
00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:26.454
To remind you, a linear vector space is a
basic concept of Linear Algebra, which

31
00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:32.940
implies a set of elements that we call
vectors such that we can define a sum of

32
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.144
any two vectors and a sum of any two
vectors itself belongs to this set, to

33
00:02:39.144 --> 00:02:43.006
this vector space.
And where we can also define a

34
00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:47.746
multiplication by a constant, either real
or complex, depending on the

35
00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:53.434
circumstances, and this sort of stretching
of a vector, also gives rise to another

36
00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:57.364
element of the set.
So, in other words, this multiplication

37
00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.703
and addition of vectors are closed
operations.

38
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.559
So, through this superposition principle,
we can suspect that whatever the

39
00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:13.388
mathematical objects are the described
quantum states, they also in some sense

40
00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:19.234
belong to a closed linear vector space
that is what we call the Hilbert space.

41
00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:23.155
But what about the wave-function that we
have become already familiar with.

42
00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:30.098
So, this wave-function psi of r should be
thought of in this abstract language and

43
00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:35.330
approached as a specific representation of
a quantum state.

44
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.784
We're going to discuss the meaning of it a
little later.

45
00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:41.650
But here, I just would like to mention
that it's much like coordinates of a

46
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.702
vector.
So, let's say, if we have in the simplest

47
00:03:44.702 --> 00:03:49.958
example we could have, let's say, vector
in two dimensions with some coordinates ax

48
00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.484
and ay.
So, these particular coordinates are

49
00:03:52.484 --> 00:03:56.256
specific to a choice of coordinate axis.
See, we are free to choose another

50
00:03:56.256 --> 00:04:00.018
coordinate system, in which case, the
coordinates will change, but the vector

51
00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:03.170
itself in some sense, in some absolute
sense will remain the same.

52
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.252
So likewise, in quantum theory, one can
think about an existing quantum state,

53
00:04:08.252 --> 00:04:11.780
which is sort of independent of our way to
describe it.

54
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.452
And if we choose to do so using the
wave-function, it, sort of, corresponds to

55
00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:22.789
the choice of particular basis.
But there are circumstances, however,

56
00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.624
where we don't want to specify a
representation.

57
00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:32.342
In this case, we could have called our
vector, state vector as psi with a vector

58
00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:37.550
sign on top which would have been the
usual notation in Linear Algebra, but

59
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.842
instead of using this notation, Dirac
found useful to use another notation

60
00:04:42.842 --> 00:04:47.124
presented here which is so-called ket
vector by Dirac.

61
00:04:47.124 --> 00:04:52.389
And also, there is a bra vector which
corresponds essentially to psi dagger and

62
00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.264
I, to tell you the truth, there is no
profound reason for the choice of this

63
00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:02.412
particular notation so they just turned
out to be convenient to a couple metric

64
00:05:02.412 --> 00:05:06.987
elements, etc., we will see.
And, not that there is a profound reason

65
00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:12.237
to call them this way, bra and ket vectors
basically are called this way because when

66
00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:16.683
put together, they sound like a bracket,
which sort of they look like.

67
00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:21.650
So now, let me present a few
embarrassingly simple facts from the basic

68
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.010
Linear Algebra that I do expect most of
you to know but however, I'm going to, I'm

69
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.530
still going to remind you of those because
they're going to be connected to slightly

70
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:38.050
more complicated structures that arise in
the abstract mathematical formulas of

71
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.726
quantum mechanics.
So, what I have here is simply a planar

72
00:05:43.726 --> 00:05:49.966
vector in two dimensions, some vector e
and if I have a coordinate system, x and

73
00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:55.726
y, with some unit vectors ex and ey, so I
can write my vector as a linear

74
00:05:55.726 --> 00:06:03.596
combination of this unit vectors.
So, ex here is 1, 0 and ey is 0, 1.

75
00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:10.202
Or I can write it as so.
So, the vector and its conjugate.

76
00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:15.244
So, another things I want to emphasize is
that if we consider the full length

77
00:06:15.244 --> 00:06:20.204
structure, ex, ex dagger plus ey, ey
dagger, on this two, there's a metrics

78
00:06:20.204 --> 00:06:25.886
multiplication of these vectors.
So, we're going to have 1, 0, 0, 0 in the

79
00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:33.752
first room plus 0, 0, 0, 1 in the second
room, which when put together, becomes an

80
00:06:33.752 --> 00:06:39.231
identity matrix.
But very importantly, this result is not

81
00:06:39.231 --> 00:06:44.647
unique to the particular choice of these
orthonormal bases.

82
00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:51.800
The result holds for any such orthonormal
bases in any dimension and in any linear

83
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.386
vector space.
Now, the reason I'm telling you all these

84
00:06:55.386 --> 00:07:00.146
is because in quantum mechanics, so as we
just discussed, so the state vectors, they

85
00:07:00.146 --> 00:07:04.974
represent elements in some Hilbert space,
in some linear vector space, which we call

86
00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:08.238
Hilbert space.
But in order to be able to work with this

87
00:07:08.238 --> 00:07:12.654
vector, just like here, we need introduce
a coordinate system so that we have

88
00:07:12.654 --> 00:07:17.412
something concrete to work with.
So, in quantum mechanics, we have to

89
00:07:17.412 --> 00:07:20.979
define a basis.
Since the Hilbert space is much more

90
00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:26.162
complicated in, generally than this two
dimensional vector space, and most often,

91
00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:30.564
we're dealing actually with infinite
dimensional Hilbert spaces, so the

92
00:07:30.564 --> 00:07:34.437
structure of the basis is generally more
complicated.

93
00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:39.620
But nevertheless, the properties that we
just discussed, the simple properties of

94
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.462
Linear Algebra, so are, still remain the
same.

95
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:49.197
So, for example, this identity that we
just derived for this basis ex and ey also

96
00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:53.390
is, holds for the basis in a, in the
Hilbert space.

97
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.571
So, let's see if we have a set of the x as
either a discrete set or a continuum set.

98
00:07:57.572 --> 00:08:03.621
We will see both of them.
So the sum of this ket-bra products over

99
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:08.017
all basis vectors, gives rise to an
Identity operation.

100
00:08:08.017 --> 00:08:14.273
And this resolution of identity is going
to be extremely useful for us in a number

101
00:08:14.273 --> 00:08:18.981
of derivations that we're going to see
throughout the course.

102
00:08:18.981 --> 00:08:22.620
So, for example, for this q, I haven't
really specified the physical meaning of

103
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.622
this q, it can be anything.
So, one example we're going to see pretty

104
00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:33.072
often is when we're dealing with the
integral over volume of product like this,

105
00:08:33.072 --> 00:08:38.724
where this vectors respond to eigenstates
of the position operator.

106
00:08:38.724 --> 00:08:45.024
So, another thing I want to mention here
is that any wave-function, so what,what

107
00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:51.234
basis really means is that any vector in a
linear vector space can be represented as

108
00:08:51.234 --> 00:08:57.496
a linear combination of the basis vectors.
Just like here, I represented my vector a

109
00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:02.612
as a linear combination of ex and ey.
So, the fact that I have a basis here

110
00:09:02.612 --> 00:09:08.420
implies that I can represent my
wave-function or my state vector as a

111
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.754
linear combination of these q's.
And the matrix elements between q and psi

112
00:09:13.754 --> 00:09:18.542
is what we actually call the wave-function
in the q representation.

113
00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:25.862
So, this is much like these coordinates.
So, these coordinates, for instance here,

114
00:09:25.862 --> 00:09:34.914
ax is can be written as ex dagger times a,
and here psi of q can be written as a

115
00:09:34.914 --> 00:09:40.198
bracket product of q and psi.
So, and again, in principle, we can have

116
00:09:40.198 --> 00:09:44.752
two situations, either we have a discrete
spectrum or we have a continuum spectrum

117
00:09:44.752 --> 00:09:49.108
in the former case, we have a sum over q,
in the latter case we have an integral

118
00:09:49.108 --> 00:09:53.510
over q.
But now, a question remains of how to

119
00:09:53.510 --> 00:10:00.075
actually choose a basis or representation
to describe our state vector or

120
00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:04.210
wave-function.
Just like in the usual Linear Algebra

121
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:09.030
there is no absolute or correct answer.
The choice of a basis is a question of

122
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.212
convenience.
But there is some standard or natural

123
00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:20.928
choices that can be constructed, and so
I'm going to discuss now how it's how it's

124
00:10:20.928 --> 00:10:23.704
done.
So, we already know that physical

125
00:10:23.704 --> 00:10:28.852
observables in Quantum Mechanics are
associated with linear Hermitian or

126
00:10:28.852 --> 00:10:33.272
self-adjoined operators.
For a generic such operator, one can

127
00:10:33.272 --> 00:10:39.110
define the eigenvalue problem as here,
which basically is the problem of finding

128
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:45.116
a vector or vectors, set of vectors, which
under the action of the operator don't

129
00:10:45.116 --> 00:10:50.050
really change but just are stretched with
a certain eigenvalue a.

130
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.554
And for the Hermitian and self-adjoined
operator, these values of a are real

131
00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:59.590
numbers.
So what's essential is that, in many

132
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:07.180
cases, this set of eigenvalues of such
operators form a basis in the Hilbert

133
00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.610
space.
This means that we can expand our

134
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:14.855
wave-function in terms of this basis
vectors.

135
00:11:14.855 --> 00:11:21.623
And the corresponding matrix elements, so
let's say for this vector a, whatever it

136
00:11:21.623 --> 00:11:26.230
is, is called the wave-function in the a
representation.

137
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.863
So, one can construct an infinite number
of such representations, just like there

138
00:11:30.863 --> 00:11:35.201
exist an infinite number of observables
and corresponding operators.

139
00:11:35.201 --> 00:11:40.407
But sort of a natural way to choose a
basis is to use operators that are

140
00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:45.682
irrelevant to our problem, such as for
instance, the coordinate operator, it's

141
00:11:45.682 --> 00:11:51.379
just here in one dimensional quantum
mechanics, so the momentum operator.

142
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:56.201
And the corresponding matrix elements, psi
of x or psi of p, are called the

143
00:11:56.201 --> 00:12:01.077
coordinate representation and the momentum
representation correspondingly.

144
00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:07.395
So for example, psi of x or psi of r, we
have already seen many times in our

145
00:12:07.395 --> 00:12:11.152
lectures.
Now, the meaning of this of this basis

146
00:12:11.152 --> 00:12:15.717
vector is, is essentially this tightly
localized wave packets.

147
00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:19.991
We shall locate it in a precise point and
space.

148
00:12:19.992 --> 00:12:27.347
So in contrast, the vectors p correspond
to states with the well-defined momentum,

149
00:12:27.347 --> 00:12:31.140
but which are completely delocalized in
space.

150
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.628
So, these are completely different
vectors, completely different basis, and

151
00:12:35.628 --> 00:12:39.143
which one to choose is entirely the
question of convenience.
