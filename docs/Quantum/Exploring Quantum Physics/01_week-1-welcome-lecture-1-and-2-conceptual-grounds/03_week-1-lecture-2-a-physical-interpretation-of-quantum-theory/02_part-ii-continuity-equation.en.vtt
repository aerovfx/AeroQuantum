00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.300
In this video, I'm going to present
a rather technical deviation of

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:10.100
an important equation of quantum theory,
the continuity equation for probability,

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.770
which both relies on the born
interpretation of quantum theory and

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.090
also serves as a sort of safety check for

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.629
it because it establishes
the conservation of probability.

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.430
The idea here is that even though
we cannot say with certainty

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.820
where exactly our quantum
particle is located,

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.370
we can certainly be sure that it
is located somewhere in space.

9
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.330
So, if we perform a measurement and
look for the particle everywhere,

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.255
we are going to find it with
a probability equal to 1.

11
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.070
And this total probability
never becomes more than 1 and

12
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.560
certainly cannot become larger than 1,
so it is conserved.

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.110
And this simple conservation law

14
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.410
gives rise to this continuity
equation that we're going to derive.

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.050
Now, the form of this equation is actually
not specific to quantum theory, and

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.940
it appears in many different
fields of physics.

17
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.169
So rho here is the density
of a air construct quantity.

18
00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:08.913
In our case, this is the probability
density, which per the Born

19
00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:13.670
rule is equal to the absolute value
of the wave function squared.

20
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.070
And j here is the probability current,
which we actually are going to derive.

21
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.825
So, to see that this equation indeed
describes some sort of a conservation law,

22
00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:30.285
let me consider an arbitrary volume in
space, so let's say this is a volume v.

23
00:01:33.234 --> 00:01:38.620
And let me also denote the surface
encircling this volume as dv.

24
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.460
And let me be interested in
the probability of finding the particle,

25
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.560
my quantum particle, inside this volume.

26
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.230
So this probability, let me call it Pv,
is going to be an integral

27
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.750
of the probability density, rho,
which appears here, over this volume.

28
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.530
Now, to look at the dynamics
of this probability with time,

29
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.810
let me integrate both sides of
this equation over the volume.

30
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.120
Well, the right hand side here is 0,
there is not much to integrate.

31
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.690
But the first term is going
to give me just dP/dt,

32
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.930
and the second term is going to be
an integral of the divergence of j,

33
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.485
and the sum of these two
terms is equal to 0.

34
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:36.000
Now at this stage, I can use the Gauss's
theorem to handle the second term,

35
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.660
which tells me that the integral
of the full divergence, so

36
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.595
for volume is equal to a flux of
the vector of which I calculated

37
00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:50.200
divergence through the surface
surrounding my volume.

38
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.100
So this is my dv.

39
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.917
So in ds here is
an elementary surface element

40
00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:02.480
with the vector pointing outwards.

41
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.913
So I'm sure some of you have already
seen the Gauss theorem, let's say,

42
00:03:06.913 --> 00:03:09.139
in the theory of electromagnetism.

43
00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.739
But if you forgot about it or
you have never seen it, so

44
00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.379
let me just mention that this Gauss
theorem is in some sense similar to

45
00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.710
the simple identity that we
oftentimes use for usual integral.

46
00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.579
So let's see if we have
an integral between a and

47
00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.990
b of full derivative function, df/dx.

48
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:34.940
So we can write the result as f(b)- f(a).

49
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.562
So essentially in this case,
we have a one dimensional segment,

50
00:03:39.562 --> 00:03:42.260
from a to b, over which we integrate.

51
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.340
And if we have a full derivative,
we can only focus on the end points.

52
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.720
So this, the only thing which
answers the final result.

53
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.510
So likewise, if we have a more
complicated integral now,

54
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.722
an integral over three dimensional volume,
but of a full derivative,

55
00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:04.410
which divergence is, so
instead of having two boundary values,

56
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.086
we have a surface integral going
through this surface, through this dv.

57
00:04:08.086 --> 00:04:12.040
So in some sense,
this dv is similar to a and b, so

58
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.950
the volume is similar to
a segment between a and b.

59
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.310
And the full derivative df/dx is
similar to the divergence of j.

60
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.438
So what we actually have established
here is that the derivative,

61
00:04:25.438 --> 00:04:31.700
what we call P dot of the probability
of finding a particle in the volume v,

62
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.040
is equal to minus the flux of
the probability current again.

63
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.290
We're going to derive it a little
later through this orifice

64
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.610
surrounding this volume.

65
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.674
And let's see if we have a current,
let's say, going outwards here luckily so

66
00:04:45.674 --> 00:04:50.736
that there is, let's say, forms a small
angle with this ds, so then this j.ds

67
00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:55.770
is positive, which corresponds to
a negative change in the probability.

68
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.050
So and it makes sense because it
means that the current carries away

69
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.680
the probability, and the probability of
finding the particle inside decreases.

70
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.720
So if we, on the other hand,

71
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.190
have the current going inside,
the probability is going to increase.

72
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.948
So, in order for me to prove the
continuity equation in the formula I just

73
00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:19.394
formulated, let me calculate
directly the probability of finding

74
00:05:19.394 --> 00:05:23.150
my particle in the volume v
over time using the Born rule.

75
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.879
And the Born rule basically implies
that I calculate the derivative of this

76
00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.075
integral of the volume of the absolute
value of my wave function squared.

77
00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:36.708
And the absolute value can be written,
of course by definition,

78
00:05:36.708 --> 00:05:40.078
as a product of the wave function and
its complex conjugate,

79
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:42.402
everything integrated over the volume.

80
00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:48.501
So now if I apply this
derivative to this product,

81
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:54.760
I can write it as psi star
dot psi + psi star psi dot.

82
00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.797
So in order for me to simplify it further,
let me just use the Schrodinger equation

83
00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:06.860
in its centered form, which actually
appears on the logo of our course.

84
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.003
So and
express the psi dot from here as simply

85
00:06:12.003 --> 00:06:17.711
-i over each bar coming
to the ion acting on psi.

86
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.745
So I just divide it by age bar and

87
00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:23.205
multiply both sides with
the imaginary constant i.

88
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.899
So I can also derive the same equation for
psi star dot, and

89
00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:34.764
since coming to ion, it's sort of real
because of the kinetic potential,

90
00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:40.070
and there's going to be a + i/h bar,
each acting on psi.

91
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.780
Now my age here is a combination
of kinetic energy and

92
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.080
the potential energy, so kinetic energy
is a sort of an involved operator,

93
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.230
which is the momentum squared and
potential energy is just a multiplication.

94
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.950
It just multiplies by wave function.

95
00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:02.360
So if I put everything together, what I
will find is the following for Pv dot.

96
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.746
So I'm going to have here,
instead of psi star dot,

97
00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:14.219
I'm going to have this guy,
so i h bar h psi and

98
00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:20.320
here, I'm going to have
a -i h bar psi star h psi.

99
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.938
So if h were a number, so these two
terms would cancel each other out, and

100
00:07:24.938 --> 00:07:29.350
it does happen, as a matter of fact,
for the potential energy term.

101
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.770
So this h can actually be
replaced with a kinetic energy.

102
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:39.320
But there's no cancellation
necessarily for the kinetic energy,

103
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.690
because again, this is an operator which
acts on different functions here and here.

104
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:50.369
And this operator is equal to just
p squared/2m or -h squared/2m,

105
00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:55.730
Laplacian, so
we should write as delta lambda squared.

106
00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.347
So again, putting everything together,
so what I have is -i h bar/2m,

107
00:08:03.347 --> 00:08:07.199
which I can factor out
outside the integral.

108
00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:13.231
And in the brackets,
I'm going to have the Laplacian,

109
00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:21.155
lambda squared, psi star times
psi- psi star, lambda squared psi.

110
00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:25.915
So the last step here is to integrate
this expression by parts, and if I do so

111
00:08:25.915 --> 00:08:30.826
essentially by moving this delta from
here to here and from here back to here,

112
00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:35.820
so I see that these terms become
identical and cancel each other out.

113
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.971
And the only term which survives
is the full derivative,

114
00:08:44.198 --> 00:08:49.890
Of delta psi star psi- complex conjugated.

115
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.360
So and this whole thing, well,

116
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.620
times this coefficient, is exactly
the current that we have been looking for.

117
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:00.340
Because, again,

118
00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:04.920
we ended up with a full derivative of
a vector integrated over the volume.

119
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.069
So we can write it as
minus an integral for

120
00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:18.580
sum j over ds over the surface
sort of encircling our volume.

121
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:24.185
So finally, we can just collect everything
from this expression and write the final

122
00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:28.195
expression for the current, which I
will write in the full length form.

123
00:09:28.195 --> 00:09:37.227
It's going to be 1/2 psi star p/m
acting on psi + complex conjugated.

124
00:09:37.227 --> 00:09:40.947
And so the reason I can write it like
this is because p is an operator,

125
00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:48.647
which is equal to -i h bar nebula,
and this -i h bar nebula appears here.

126
00:09:48.647 --> 00:09:51.394
And so
if we look at these final expressions,

127
00:09:51.394 --> 00:09:55.950
we see that this measure effect,
it makes sort of intuitive physical sense

128
00:09:55.950 --> 00:10:00.872
because in classical physics, a classical
current associated with density rho

129
00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:05.200
is simply the density times
the velocity with which it moves.

130
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.880
Now here in quantum mechanics,
the momentum is an operator, and

131
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.720
so velocity, which is momentum
divided by m, is also an operator.

132
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.970
And this operator sort
of acts on the density,

133
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.630
which is rho, is psi star psi.

134
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.040
And so this is the final result,
which connects the change

135
00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.840
in the probability of finding
a particle in the volume v with

136
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.260
the flux of a certain probability
current flowing through this surface.
