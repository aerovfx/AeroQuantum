1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,220
In the first lecture, we guessed,
and, in some sense, at the form of

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,060
the Schroedinger equation, relying on
a few very basic experimental facts

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:15,599
such as wave particle duality and the
dispersion relation of a free electron.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:21,000
But we didn't talk too much about the
meaning of the main object that appears in

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,593
the this equation, the wave function,
which was introduced in an fashion.

6
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:32,300
So, today, I'm going to talk about the
actual physical interpretation of quantum

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,570
theory formulated this week.

8
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,290
And we are also going to introduce a few
very important standard notations and

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,085
conventions.

10
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:44,350
That they're going to be used
throughout the course and so

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,780
they are routinely used in the standard
literature on the subject.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,400
So, here is the Schroedinger equation.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,626
Once again, we're going to see
it very often in this course.

14
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:58,777
And I'm also showing here
the a part of the first page of

15
00:00:58,777 --> 00:01:04,113
the Original Paper by Schroedinger
published December of 1926.

16
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:07,729
And it's actually very interesting how
Schroedinger came up with this work

17
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:08,640
on this equation.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,640
So apparently,
the story started back in 1925 or so

19
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,796
when he was working under Dubai, and
Dubai had just read a paper by de Broglie,

20
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:23,539
where de Broglie was introducing
his wave particle duality idea.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,470
So, he got interested in these ideas and

22
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,410
suggested Schrodinger to give
a seminar on the de Broglie work.

23
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,980
So, currently Schrodinger dismissed
this at first saying that

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,800
he didn't even want to think
about such a silly theory, but

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,130
he had to give in because well de
Broglie was effectively his supervisor.

26
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,190
And so,
he was looking into de Broglie's work

27
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,860
trying to present it in a more
mathematically sophisticated form.

28
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,410
And in doing so,

29
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,360
he came up with the Schrödinger
equation essentially as we know it.

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,560
Which brought him the world
wide recognition and

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,200
Nobel Prize in physics in 1953.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,840
So, another important thing that
Schrödinger did was that he used his

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,730
equation to solve a very important
problem of a charged particle and

34
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,780
a Coulomb potential which, essentially,
describes a quantum hydrogen atom.

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,460
And he found the energy
level structure which was

36
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,430
consistent with the Bohr's atom and so

37
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,030
actually Charles Clark is going to talk
about the solution later in the course,

38
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,440
but I'm going to just mention here that
this was indeed very important and

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,125
it was a clear smoking gun that
Schrodinger was on the right track.

40
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:46,600
But according to the at
least quite interestingly

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,230
Schrodinger really didn't understand
the true meaning of his own work.

42
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,440
He actually dismissed
the importance of it at first.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,370
So, I don't know if it was just
de Broglie's being jealous or

44
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,530
it was true but certainly if you actually
read the original paper by Schrodinger.

45
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,430
You don't see too much insight into
the true physical interpretation of his

46
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,100
own equation.

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,220
And the correct interpretation
of Schrodinger's equation

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,160
was developed very shortly after
Schrodinger's work by Max Born.

49
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,280
Perhaps actually I should say,
not the correct interpretation but

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,990
the commonly accepted interpretation,
because scientists

51
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,620
actually have been arguing about
the interpretation up to these days.

52
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,990
And some are still not convinced
that the Born interpretation and

53
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,480
the Born rule that I'm going to present is
the only correct view of quantum physics.

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,220
But certainly this Born rule is
the cornerstone of a standard

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,960
quantum theory and it isn't yet
consistent with the all

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,980
experimental data as we
know it at this stage.

57
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,420
Now before formulating this rule,
I would like to make a few jail comments

58
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,955
about quantum physics and made them
in contrast to classical physics.

59
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:08,735
So in classical physics, if we have
a classical system, let's say this is

60
00:04:08,735 --> 00:04:13,105
a closed classical system with some
classical particles moving around.

61
00:04:13,105 --> 00:04:17,405
And if we know everything about
this system, let's say we know all

62
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:21,215
the coordinates of all the particles
at a certain moment of time and

63
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:23,455
all the velocities at
a certain moment of time.

64
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,460
Then classical theory predicts
with absolute certainty

65
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,320
the result of any conceivable experiment
that is going to happen in the future.

66
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,250
Which is determined by,

67
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:41,170
let's say trajectory of particles
at any subsequent moment of time.

68
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:46,780
And they in turn determine all possible
outcomes of all possible experience.

69
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,464
Now, this is the classical system.

70
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:53,230
So, the truth about the quantum system, so

71
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,730
if you look at the actual
situation with quantum systems.

72
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,280
So, if you have a quantum
system like that, so

73
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,800
with some wave function to the side.

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,570
So, even if we know everything
possible about this quantum system,

75
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,708
that is, if we know sine, if we know all
the forces everything about the system.

76
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:19,050
We still cannot possibly predict
with certainty the outcomes of

77
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,150
well posed experiments.

78
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,570
Let's say, if we have some detectors here,
and the measure,

79
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:29,320
well let's say detect electrons or
some other particles.

80
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,280
So, even if we know everything
about the quantum electrons,

81
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,870
we still cannot predict for

82
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,750
sure which detector is going to pick up
an electron at a certain moment of time.

83
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,750
And so this uncertainty is
intrinsic to quantum physics and

84
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,718
there is no way around it.

85
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,895
And so Born realized it and so

86
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:51,536
he also found a way to quantify this
uncertainty using the wave function.

87
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:56,829
And his, well we know now is
the Born rule is written here,

88
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:02,246
so basically he proposed and
afterwards it was confirmed.

89
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:07,360
Again by comparing with experimental data,
that the absolute value of the wave

90
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,549
function, related in certain position
in space, and a certain moment of time,

91
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:17,132
gives a probability density of finding
a quantum particle described by

92
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:21,620
this wave function at this position and
at this moment of time, see.

93
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,090
Well, the probability itself is going to
be psi, absolute value of psi squared

94
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,660
times the volume, the elementary volume
in the vicinity of a certain point.

95
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,940
This work of Max Born turned out to be
extremely influential and ground breaking

96
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:43,310
and he eventually received a Nobel Prize
for his ideas, in part In 1954.

97
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,470
As a matter of fact, he should have
received this award much earlier.

98
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,100
He was nominated by Albert Einstein
actually, back in the 30s.

99
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,090
But, he didn't get it due
to some political reasons.

100
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,170
But in any case his probabilistic
interpretation was and

101
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:05,020
actually remains a very remarkable
feature of quantum physics

102
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,600
which also is a source of
confusion often times.

103
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,870
And I'm actually supposed
to tell you now about this

104
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,159
probabilistic property being
a mystery of quantum physics.

105
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,610
And something which we will
never be able to understand.

106
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,250
But I would actually argue otherwise,
that there is nothing mysterious about it.

107
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,890
If by mysterious, we mean something
that is not consistent with our

108
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,900
everyday intuition, everyday experience,

109
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,450
especially uncertainty is a part
of our everyday lives, whether we

110
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,020
are dealing with a sporting event or any
other event in our lives we cannot predict

111
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,850
with certainty even if we know
everything how it's going to turn out.

112
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:53,000
And so I don't see a reason to demand
from psi a deterministic answer.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,690
And nature just doesn't work in this way.

114
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,770
And so we should just accept this fact and
get used to it.
