00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:01,740
Hi everybody, and

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,100
welcome to the first lecture in our
course Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,345
Today, I will introduce the main
formulation of Quantum Theory,

4
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:11,100
Uta SchrÃ¶dinger, and

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,459
I'll also tell you a little bit about
the fascinating history of the subject.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,420
But before going to this main part,

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,530
I would like to talk about the process
of learning quantum physics.

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,350
And about why I think so many people
find it difficult and frustrating.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,730
And I hope that this brief discussion
will help you avoid this frustration.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,519
And make the process of learning
quantum physics here more effective.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,320
Richard Feynman really
doesn't need an introduction.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,410
He was one of the heroes and

13
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,610
legends in physics universally
recognized as a genius.

14
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,760
He was also a great speaker and
enthusiastic popularizer of physics.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,760
In 1979, he gave a series of very
interesting lectures on quantum physics

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,010
at the University of
Auckland in New Zealand.

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,270
They're actually available
on YouTube online, and

18
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,510
I would encourage you to listen to them.

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,271
If you do so,
you will see that Feynman spends 30 or so

20
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,936
minutes in the beginning of his first
lecture to prepare the audience for

21
00:01:03,936 --> 00:01:06,680
what they were going to hear next.

22
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,840
And one of the main messages in this
introductory part was that no matter

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,980
what Feynman were to do,

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,450
the audience wouldn't really be able
to understand quantum mechanics anyway.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,990
Then he talks about physics students and

26
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,460
physics professors and their level
of understanding of Quantum Physics.

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,460
Let's listen to what Feynman
had to say in this regard.

28
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,550
>> If I'm going to explain this to you,
the question is,

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,020
are you going to understand it?

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,000
Will you understand the theory when
I tell you first, that the first

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,430
time we really thoroughly explain it to
our own physics students is when they're

32
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,690
in the third year graduate physics, then
you think the answer's going to be no.

33
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,733
And that's correct.

34
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:46,222
You will not understand it.

35
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:48,207
>> [LAUGH]
>> But

36
00:01:48,207 --> 00:01:51,900
this business about not understanding

37
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,360
is a very serious one that we have
between a scientist and an audience.

38
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,340
And I want to work with you because
I want to tell you something.

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,236
The students do not understand it either.

40
00:02:05,236 --> 00:02:07,740
>> [LAUGH]
>> And that's because

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,920
the professor doesn't understand-
>> [LAUGH]

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,220
>> Which is not a joke.

43
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,520
But very interesting.

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,550
>> So what Feynman seems to be saying
is that nobody, not even professional

45
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,110
physicists, other then himself perhaps,
really understands quantum physics.

46
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,460
Well, this is probably the last thing you
want to hear before starting this course.

47
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,620
But this is strictly not my intention to
give you the impression that you should

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,760
give up without even trying.

49
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,620
On the contrary, I'd like to
speculate what I think Feynman might

50
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,600
have meant there about why I think so
many people

51
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,180
find it difficult to study Quantum Physics
and other advanced physics subjects.

52
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,870
And I hope that this discussion
will help us further

53
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,390
down the road when we encounter unusual
counter intuitive quantum phenomenon.

54
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,900
Let us look at quantum mechanics
from the perspective of

55
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,220
all major physics theories out there.

56
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,302
In this slide I attempt to present all
these theories in a single diagram,

57
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:04,650
which of course is an unrealistic
sort of silly task and so

58
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,930
the result I came up with
shouldn't be taken to seriously.

59
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,820
What we have here are three axes
labeling fundamental physics constants.

60
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,793
So here I have the inverse speed of light.

61
00:03:20,793 --> 00:03:28,205
This constant g is the gravity constant
which appears in the Newtonian gravity.

62
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:32,481
And along with the horizontal axis
I have the Planck constant, which,

63
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:37,042
as we shall see, is the most important
fundamental constant that appears in

64
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:41,340
quantum mechanics in that it relays
the particle and wave properties.

65
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,020
Now, the red dots in this
diagram represent symbolically

66
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,269
major fields of physics.

67
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,540
For example,
on this line I have two red dots.

68
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,330
So the one which has all, corresponds
to all physical constants being zero

69
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:06,070
is just kinematics or classical mechanics,
essentially 17th century physics.

70
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,018
So this dot here with
a finite gravity constant but

71
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:14,163
all other constants zero
is the Newtonian gravity.

72
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:21,586
Now moving up the vertical axis to
a finite speed of light brings us

73
00:04:21,586 --> 00:04:27,636
to a theory which takes into account this
finite speed with which interactions

74
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:33,890
propagate, and this is the celebrated
special relativity theory of Einstein.

75
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,790
Combining it with gravity
results in general relativity,

76
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,060
another celebrated, another very
famous geometric theory of Einstein.

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,030
Finally moving along
the horizontal axis to a finite

78
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,028
Planck constant brings us to
actually the subject of our course.

79
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:58,300
Non relativistic quantum mechanics.

80
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,076
So there is also this part, which we're
not going to discuss too much in this

81
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:06,088
course combines the relativistic effects
and the quantum mechanical effects.

82
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:10,798
And this is the so called Quantum Field
Theory of quantum electric dynamics,

83
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:12,542
a more complicated theory.

84
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,757
Actually I could have other theory,

85
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:18,730
another dot which has all
fundamental physics constants.

86
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,160
This would be theory of everything.

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,190
It doesn't really exist yet
but everybody wants to get it,

88
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,600
so this has been one of the holy
grails of physics for many years.

89
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,840
Now, going back to the reigning
quantum physics and

90
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,760
what does it all have to do with it.

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:43,280
So, let us discuss what theory
governs our everyday lives.

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,670
What is sort of our comfort zone?

93
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,465
And I would claim that we're at
somewhere here in this area.

94
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:54,070
Certainly the length scales
that we encounter in our

95
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,450
every day lives are much
larger than atomic.

96
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,550
The velocities are certainly much
smaller than the speed of light.

97
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:07,040
And, well, we do experience gravity on
a daily basis, so we're somewhere here.

98
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,709
And here is also where
our intuition works.

99
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:16,070
And if we say you understand something,
what we usually mean by that is that we

100
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:22,470
can relate a phenomenon to another
phenomenon that occurs here in this area.

101
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,500
So for example, if we were to
say that we really understand

102
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,940
the quantum mechanical affect,
it would oftentimes imply that we

103
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,660
have found a way to relate it by
something we already know here.

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,800
But the problem with all these advanced
physics subjects, especially with

105
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,929
Quantum Physics, is that such mapping,
such a relation, is not always possible.

106
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:54,100
In other words, it's not always
possible to meaningfully project

107
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,120
quantum mechanical phenomenon
on this classical axis.

108
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,720
And if no classical analog exists,
this is what we call strange.

109
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,290
And this is what we find difficult.

110
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,420
But on the other hand, if we were to
imagine if a fictitious civilization of

111
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,900
tiny species that lived on atomic
scales somewhere in this area, so

112
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:27,280
these guys would have had really a lot of
problems understanding our classical work.

113
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,240
So the problem is not really with
the quantum physics itself, but

114
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:37,000
with our centristic position on
how we want to understand it.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,910
But now how do we learn Quantum Physics
if we can't really readily understand it

116
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,460
at a intuitive level?

117
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,580
Fortunately, there is a way to do so.

118
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,630
By speaking a common language of all
physics theories that is not rooted in,

119
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,435
and is independent of,
our classical world.

120
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,255
And this is of course Mathematical
Formalism that needs to be developed.

121
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:08,955
And it may be true now that two
seemingly unrelated phenomena,

122
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,535
let's say on the classical side and
on the quantum side,

123
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:17,880
may be explained by similar differential
equations or something like that.

124
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,440
And by studying those we
can develop intuition about

125
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,800
something which is otherwise
inaccessible to us.

126
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,170
But after this discussion you may ask,
why bother studying Quantum Physics

127
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:36,400
if it's not really relevant
to our everyday lives?

128
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,150
So the motivation comes from experiments.

129
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,540
And more recently also from technological
advances that create systems and

130
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,730
devices which operate further
on the right on this axis.

131
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,230
The take home message here is that
when you study Quantum Physics or

132
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,130
any other advanced physics subject for
this matter, you should actually

133
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,110
be prepared to encounter phenomena that
may appear bizarre at the first sight, and

134
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,940
that you may find difficult to understand.

135
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,580
When it does happen, don't panic and
certainly don't drop the course

136
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,100
because of that, and don't assume that
others find these things obvious.

137
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,930
It's certainly not the case.

138
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,860
So I think the best way to
understand such new concepts

139
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,350
is first understand experimental
data that support them.

140
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:28,470
And then develop or
understand the mathematical formalism, and

141
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,670
the proper theory that
describes this phenomena.

142
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,930
So when you use this theory again and

143
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,900
again, you will develop
your own intuition.

144
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,360
And get the feeling about it deeper
understanding of the subject.

145
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,020
So speaking about the mathematical side,

146
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,170
so I should mention, of course,
quantum mechanics is a demanding subject.

147
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,570
And we will have to use certain
advanced mathematical techniques, but

148
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,860
there will be lectures with different sort
of levels of mathematical sophistication.

149
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,190
Some of them will be pretty advanced,

150
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,800
some of them actually won't
use much math at all.

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,452
And so I hope that all of you
with different backgrounds, and

152
00:10:05,452 --> 00:10:08,600
different levels of
mathematical preparation will

153
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,650
find something that is useful and
interesting.
