1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,660
Now we're going to rely on
wave particle duality to use

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,150
the form of the main equation of quantum
physics, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,010
But before going into this main part,

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,390
let me ask the following question,
which picture is more fundamental?

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,700
The particle based picture,
or the wave based picture?

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,180
So here I have an example of what
we usually mean by particle.

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,450
In this case, here's a baseball, and

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:32,010
this is an object which has a well defined
velocity and position at any given time.

9
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,090
We can identify it's position simply just
by looking at it and measure its velocity.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,600
In contrast,
when we're talking about waves,

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,790
it doesn't really make sense to ask
the question where the wave is located.

12
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,630
So here in this example,

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm showing the wave which is
generated using a rope and just by

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,110
looking at it you realize that there
is no well-defined position of a wave.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:04,080
However, what we can do, we can define
the wave velocity and wave vector,

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,000
and also we can describe a wave
using this mathematical expression.

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,530
So in this expression,
u is the displacement.

18
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,180
So in this particular example,

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,070
u is the vertical displacement which is
a function of the coordinate and time.

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,300
And the x coordinate is
this horizontal direction.

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,240
And for a simple sinusoidal wave, this is
a kind of expression we're going to get.

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,870
Now, the relation between the wavelength
and the wave vector is lambda,

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,720
the wavelength,
is equal to 2 pi over the wave vector key.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,030
And the relation between the frequency,
omega, and

25
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,400
the velocity of the wave, so the velocity
is essentially the coefficient of

26
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,380
proportionality between omega and
the wave vector key.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,220
There are actually two types of
commonly used expressions to describe

28
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,690
a simple sinusoidal wave such as this one.

29
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,680
So the one I just described and

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,930
also the one using this
exponential of a complex argument.

31
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:13,160
So i here is the square root of minus one.

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,650
And they are equivalent to one another.

33
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,330
So here, the balance is established
by simply remembering that

34
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:26,430
exponential of i times some
real constant let's say x,

35
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,410
is equal to cosine of x, plus i sine of x.

36
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,290
So this is, this equivalence in
this case is simply an identity.

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,040
In the future we mostly will be dealing
with this description of a wave,

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,830
in terms of the exponential
of a complex number, and

39
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,580
often times, we're not going to
actually see this imaginary part.

40
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,310
The real part, we're simply
going to be describing a plane wave

41
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,020
in terms of this exponential.

42
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,430
So don't be surprised to see that.

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Now going back to the question about which
feature is more fundamental, particles or

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,140
waves.

45
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,910
I'm going to make
a statement that the latter,

46
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,480
the waves are more
fundamental than particles.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,930
Because we cannot represent
the wave in terms of a particle but

48
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:16,160
we certainly can represent
a particle in terms of waves and

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,250
this representation in the mathematical
language is called Fourier transform.

50
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,480
So Fourier transform, so
here is a generic mathematical

51
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,950
example of a Fourier transform for
some arbitrary function f(x).

52
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,110
And in this case, so
this ace of k represents so

53
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:40,830
called free harmonics or
amplitudes of this function f of x and

54
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,720
this guy's for ikx, in some sense,

55
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,990
responds to a snap shot of
a wave at any given time.

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,760
So by decomposing an arbitrary reasonable
function into this Fourier harmonics,

57
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,800
we essentially are representing
as a linear combination of waves.

58
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,342
In particular what we can do,
we can consider, let's say in this case,

59
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:13,870
function f(x) which has a very sharp

60
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,550
peak with some spread-out narrow width
around this location, let's say delta x.

61
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,690
And so if this is our f(x), so

62
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,880
we can represent this f(x)
in terms of these waves.

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,160
And this would be a decomposition of
a particle like amplitude in the waves.

64
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,140
Now going back to quantum mechanics
we can resolve a dilemma that was

65
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,695
presented by the experiments which
revealed wave particle duality.

66
00:04:42,695 --> 00:04:47,990
The dilemma being of how we want to
describe our quantum mechanical objects

67
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,050
either as particles or waves.

68
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,180
And according to the discussion in the
previous slides, it seems reasonable to

69
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,860
try describe quantum mechanical objects
in a more general form as waves.

70
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,940
And what I have in mind here are the
experiments of the type by Davidson and

71
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,760
Germer who saw that electrons when
being reflected from a crystalline

72
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,660
structure, they exhibit interference
like patterns just like light would do.

73
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,520
If we wanted to describe
interference of light,

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,830
we actually know how to do it because we
know how to solve Maxwell's equations.

75
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,420
So the solution of Maxwell's
equations in vacuum

76
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,952
are called electro magnetic waves and in
the case of free electro-magnetic wave we

77
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:38,420
would simply have written a plane wave
just like in the previous slide, and so

78
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,050
this indeed would describe the data
in terms of interference of light.

79
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,860
Now, having in mind these experiments,
we established sort of

80
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,040
one to one correspondence between
the interference of light and

81
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,550
interference of quantum electrons.

82
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,640
We are forced to write a plane wave
to describe these quantum electrons.

83
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,950
So we're going to write, let's say for

84
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,630
electron, free electron
moving in the x direction,

85
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,810
we're going to write this exponential
to the power i kx minus omega t.

86
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,590
But without the left-hand side or

87
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,770
right-hand side, this is not
a legitimate mathematical expression.

88
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,560
To make it such, we introduce
essentially new mathematical object,

89
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,630
the wave function psi (xt).

90
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,408
And we, in some sense,
postulate that free electrons,

91
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:35,820
I describe by this plane wave with some
coefficient it's not very important.

92
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, and k is the wave vector for
an electron and

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,440
wt is the frequency of the electron.

94
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:47,900
Now, to relate k and
omega to more familiar

95
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,630
physical properties such as momentum and
energy,

96
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:58,800
recall the Duvall relations between them,
between p and k and omega and energy.

97
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,190
And those relations are the full lengths,
so

98
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:06,444
p is equal to the plane
constant h bar times k and

99
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:12,070
energy is equal to h bar times w.

100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,690
So, we may as well try this
wave function for the electron

101
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,970
with now with momentum p as some
coefficient e to the power i over h bar

102
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,120
p times x minus energy times t.

103
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:38,700
So we sort of postulated a solution
to our quantum mechanical problem but

104
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,310
we don't have a problem yet
we don't have a fundamental equation

105
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,480
that our wave functions electronic
wave functions are going to satisfy.

106
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:54,710
So in order to figure out this equation we
can recall the following simple equation,

107
00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,070
namely the equation for the energy,
the kinetic energy of a free particle, and

108
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:06,070
as most of you know, this kinetic
energy is equal to m v squared over 2.

109
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,860
Or if we want to write
it in terms of momentum,

110
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,825
momentum is mass times velocity so
we can write it as p squared over 2m.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,940
And now comes the main
trick in figuring out or

112
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,660
guessing measure to c fundamental
equation of quantum physics.

113
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,520
So first of all, we're going to
demand that whatever equation we're

114
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,750
going to guess must give this
plane wave as its solution.

115
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,160
And also we're going to demand that the
energy which appears in this plane wave

116
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,380
must be related to momentum
after this relation.

117
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,430
Basically, you must enforce that
free electrons indeed have so

118
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,400
called free particle dispersion or
free particle spectrum.

119
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,980
mv squared over 2 or p squared over 2m.

120
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,710
So this also must be satisfied.

121
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,570
Well, a reasonable naive guess, and it
turns out to be incorrect let me just say,

122
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:05,020
would be to assume that the electron
wave function satisfies

123
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,409
the usual wave equation.

124
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,326
So let's say in the one-dimensional
case we would write

125
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:22,120
simply (d2) over (dx) squared minus
one over the velocity of our wave,

126
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,490
(d2) over (dt) squared, psi equals to 0.

127
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,280
Now, if we plug either of these
expressions in this equation and

128
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,110
you can check it as an exercise,
we're going to get the familiar relation

129
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,520
between the frequency and the wave vector
that I wrote in the previous slide or

130
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,194
the analogous expression for
the energy and momentum.

131
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:52,250
But, it would work actually for
electromagnetic waves.

132
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,860
It would work for photons which
are quantum electromagnetic waves.

133
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,450
But, it does not manifestly work for
electrons because this

134
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,850
linear relations between the energy and
momentum is not the kind

135
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,680
of relation we are looking for, so,
we must construct some other equation.

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,820
And the simplest such
equation can be constructed,

137
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,170
let me just erase this part here.

138
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,070
So the simplest such
equation can be constructed

139
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,880
if we notice that the derivative,

140
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,780
if we apply let's say the time derivative
to this plane wave wave function side.

141
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,920
It's going to give us
the same wave function but

142
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,270
multiplied with minus i over
h bar times E, times psi.

143
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:46,030
So this is essentially the result of
the action of this time derivative and

144
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,687
for the spatial derivative,
we're going to get plus

145
00:10:50,687 --> 00:10:55,120
i over h bar p times psi.

146
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,753
So this is the action of the x derivative.

147
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:09,810
And so we find here a clear correspondence
between the energy and the derivative.

148
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,774
i h bar d / dt.

149
00:11:12,774 --> 00:11:18,045
The momentum, in this case one-dimensional

150
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:22,290
momentum and -i h bar d / dx.

151
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,830
And of course, if we were to have
a three-dimensional momentum,

152
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:32,490
momentum vector, we would need to write,
-i h bar gradient.

153
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,178
Let me write it like this.

154
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:40,470
So this is called radiant,
which is if we have a function,

155
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,770
let's say f is by definition df / dx.

156
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,300
The unit vector in the x direction,
df over dy.

157
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:58,190
The unit vector in the y direction plus df
over dz, unit vector in the z direction.

158
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,270
So, if we want to enforce the constraint

159
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,140
that the energy of the particle,
E, is equal to p squared over 2m.

160
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,850
So we sort of forced

161
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,190
to construct the simplest equation that
would do it in the following form.

162
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,900
So, let's say in the left hand side
we're going to write our energy and

163
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,220
E i h bar d over dt acting
on the wave function side,

164
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,520
and in the right-hand side we're going to
write this so-called momentum operator.

165
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,726
Let me put the hat here.

166
00:12:36,726 --> 00:12:38,100
P squared over 2 m.

167
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,790
Also acting on psi.

168
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,940
Now if we write it explicitly as
a mathematical differential equation, i h

169
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:53,810
bar d over dt,
p squared over 2m will follow from here.

170
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,250
So i squared gives us minus one,
h squared is h squared and

171
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,302
this gradient squared is called LaPlacian.

172
00:13:02,302 --> 00:13:04,860
So it's just the usual notation for

173
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,200
this LaPlacian is either these gradient
squared explicitly or this triangle.

174
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,050
So moving this p squared over 2 m to
the left hand side I can write it as

175
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,080
plus h squared, the LaPlacian divided

176
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,866
by two m and this whole thing acts on
the wave function which in the three

177
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:29,470
dimensional case is a function of the
three dimensional position r and times t.

178
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:35,560
And this equation is the free
Schroedinger equation

179
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,190
which we sort of derived, but of course
we should use the word derived in quotes

180
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,800
because there is no way we can derive
a fundamental law of physics and

181
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,100
Schroedinger equation is
an example of such a law.

182
00:13:52,518 --> 00:13:57,500
So our derivation is nothing but a guess,
but it's a very convenient guess.

183
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,880
Because it allows us to
generalize this equation

184
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,300
to a very important class of problems.

185
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,940
Namely to the problems where
the electrons are not free electrons but

186
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,040
move in the presence of a potential.

187
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:19,230
So to see how this happens let me
sort of identify the right-hand

188
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,570
side of this equation in this
form with an energy operator,

189
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,130
which in quantum mechanics
is called Hamiltonian.

190
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,192
So this operator H hat is a very
important object in quantum mechanics,

191
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:34,575
let me actually write it, Hamiltonian.

192
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:42,277
And in the case of the free particle,
it is simply this kinetic energy,

193
00:14:42,277 --> 00:14:48,668
but, it's very natural to generalize it
to the case of an interacting particle or

194
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:54,223
particle in the potential in which
case I will write p squared over 2m,

195
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:58,513
the kinetic energy,
plus the potential energy V of r.

196
00:14:58,513 --> 00:15:04,200
And if I do so, and
if I write the resulting equation

197
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,092
as i h bar d psi over dt
on the left hand side and

198
00:15:09,092 --> 00:15:13,213
in the right hand side this h hat psi.

199
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:17,712
So this actually becomes
the fundamental equation of quantum

200
00:15:17,712 --> 00:15:22,123
physics that actually appears
on the logo of our course, and

201
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:27,312
which quite amazingly contains just
about all of non-relativistic,

202
00:15:27,312 --> 00:15:29,907
well, single particle physics and

203
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:34,940
it can be generalized also to
describe many particle physics.

204
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,790
So, the theory of Methos, the super
conductors, pretty much everything we can

205
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:46,010
imagine that doesn't involve relativistic
effects, is contained in this equation.
