1
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.830
Now we're going to put to work the main
equation of quantum mechanics,

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.670
the Schrodinger equation, and
use it solve a very interesting problem.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.479
It will also illustrate why quantum
mechanic effects are not important in our

4
00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.885
everyday lives, while being essential when
we're dealing with atomic length scales.

5
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.365
The question we're going to
ask is what happens if we

6
00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:26.325
enforce a particle-like solution
in our quantum mechanical problem.

7
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:29.895
So basically, what it means is that
we postulate, let's postulate,

8
00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:30.835
that t equals zero.

9
00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:33.380
At the initial moment
of time t equal zero,

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.220
we have the wave function such as this,
which is called Gaussian wave packet.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.950
And this wave function basically describes

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.250
a particle which is localized
in space around zero.

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.510
So it's a typical Gaussian, around zero.

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.710
And the spread out of this Gaussian is of
order d, which is the parameter of the.

15
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.380
So A here is some coefficient.

16
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.116
It's not very important at this stage.

17
00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:03.950
Now the calculation which we're going to
present is essentially the evolution

18
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.040
of this initial condition with time under
the action of the Schroedinger equation,

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.220
and it's a big technical question.

20
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.810
So for those of you who are not
interested in technical details,

21
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.810
I would like just to
present the final answer so

22
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.990
that you can understand the bottom line
without going into technicalities.

23
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.940
And so the final answer is here.

24
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.170
So here, we have the wave
function as a function of time,

25
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.040
models of it squared, so
we describe essentially particles.

26
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.930
And, as we will see, this side
squared has the same Gaussian form

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.840
as the regional wave function, but the
difference here is that the parameter d,

28
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.040
which describes its spreading,
it increases with time.

29
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.100
And it increases with time as one
plus t squared over some tau squared,

30
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.010
where tau squared is this typical time
scale at which the spreading occurs.

31
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.650
So if we now look at this dependence
of [INAUDIBLE] squared on x,

32
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.420
and as time goes by we will see a more and
more uniform density.

33
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.820
So eventually it will be almost flat.

34
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.089
Now, this basically implies
that a particle like solution,

35
00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:19.450
this type of wave [INAUDIBLE],
is unstable in quantum mechanics.

36
00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.328
So but the important thing is
the time scale itself at which

37
00:02:23.328 --> 00:02:25.000
this spreading occurs.

38
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.740
And let us estimate this time scale for

39
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.130
two sort of diametrically opposite cases.

40
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.548
So one case will be
the case of an electron,

41
00:02:37.548 --> 00:02:41.360
a microscopic elementary particle,
with a mass of about 10 to -27 grams.

42
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.790
And let's assume that it's localized

43
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.740
on atomic length scales
of 10 to -8 centimeters.

44
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:51.780
So if we plug in the numbers,

45
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.492
what we're going to see is the typical
time scale at which the spreading,

46
00:02:55.492 --> 00:03:00.748
he localization radius if you want, of
this electron doubles is on the order of

47
00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:06.560
10 minus 16 seconds,
which is an extremely short time scheme.

48
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.650
Hardly observable in any experiment.

49
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.640
Now if we take, on the contrary,
a macroscopic object, let's say a typical

50
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.820
human being, which is also described
by the laws of quantum mechanics.

51
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.131
So the difference will
be quite noticeable.

52
00:03:20.131 --> 00:03:23.949
So here, well the mass of course of
macroscopic object here will be around

53
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.613
let's say 50 kilograms, and

54
00:03:25.613 --> 00:03:29.610
let's say we want to be localized on
a distance of under 1 centimeter.

55
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.860
Well if we now plug in the numbers into
this equation, what we're going to see is

56
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.810
that the typical time scale of which
sort of quantum delocalization

57
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.630
of a human being occurs is
a quarter 10 to plus 30 seconds.

58
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:50.110
So to put this number in perspective,
so this is equal to 10 to the 23 years,

59
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.863
or 10 to the 13 10 trillion
lifetimes of the universe.

60
00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:58.900
So basically it's a, in some sense,
meaningless number, so it's a number which

61
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.200
is never relevant in any realistic
circumstances, so we shouldn't be worrying

62
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.080
too much about being quantum delocalized
due to quantum mechanical effect.

63
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.190
And if you now look at
different time scales for

64
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.070
various objects that we are dealing
with our everyday lives,

65
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.300
we're going to see that essentially for
all those objects, even the smallest ones,

66
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.150
we can safely say that quantum mechanical
effects are completely irrelevant.

67
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.286
At the moment we're going to
go to fundamental microscopic

68
00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:33.270
time scales, and
it's going to change very significantly.

69
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.600
Now, I'm going to actually derive
the main result that I presented in

70
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.630
the previous slide,
the evolution of the Gaussian wave packet.

71
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.110
And as I mentioned to you this derivation
is a bit on the technical side.

72
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.460
So those of you who are not really
interested in these technicalities

73
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.400
may just skip towards
the end of the lecture.

74
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.110
But those who want to actually learn
the technical part of quantum mechanics,

75
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.850
which is the main part of quantum
mechanics, should pay attention,

76
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.740
perhaps rederive it on your own.

77
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.390
Now the main element of the solution
is the decomposition of the initial

78
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.185
condition of this wave-packet
into the plane-waves.

79
00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:12.660
So plane-waves are presented here.

80
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.640
So sort of as a modulation as to why
we want to do something like this,

81
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.300
we should recall that
the Schrodinger equation was used or

82
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.280
derived, almost by construction,
to describe waves rather than particles.

83
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.870
In this initial conditions we have chosen
is, in some sense, an arbitrary function.

84
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.942
There's absolutely no reason why it would
be a convenient solution to anything.

85
00:05:33.942 --> 00:05:38.010
While the plane-waves are indeed
the solutions, and so

86
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.510
by decomposing this function, or
any initial condition for this match up,

87
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.300
these plane waves we actually simplify
things a lot, as we'll see later.

88
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.252
Form the medical point of view,
this composition is nothing but

89
00:05:50.252 --> 00:05:55.595
a Fourier transform of this wave
function into the functions.

90
00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:58.130
So these cosines and sines.

91
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.800
And we know very well how to do this
decomposition, but before we go to this,

92
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.740
I would like to remind you of the
following identity for Gaussian integral,

93
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.920
which actually we're going to use at
least three times in this derivation,

94
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.252
in different topics.

95
00:06:14.252 --> 00:06:17.545
So if we have an exponential
of the quadratic function,

96
00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:21.780
with some alpha and beta here, so
the integral from minus infinity to

97
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.900
positive infinity is well known and
it's given by this equation.

98
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.980
So we're going to just use it later on.

99
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.120
Now the reason it's relevant at
this stage of the derivation

100
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.070
is because the Fourier transform,
or in other words these Fourier

101
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.100
harmonics which in the context of quantum
mechanics are called wave function in

102
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.350
the momentum space, are determined exactly
by this type of Gaussian integral.

103
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.900
Because what we have to do in order to
ensure this five p, we have to take

104
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.820
the integral of this exponential,
either bar minus x squared or

105
00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:00.700
two d squared with this integral
minus i over h bar p x.

106
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:07.320
And if we look at this integral and
compare it with this Gaussian expression,

107
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.360
we will see that alpha here is
equal to one over two d squared.

108
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.800
And beta is equal to minus i h bar p.

109
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.964
So if we use now this formula, so

110
00:07:21.964 --> 00:07:26.901
beta squared is equal to minus
p squared over h squared, and

111
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:32.060
divided by four alpha will give
us the following expression.

112
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.420
So if I completely ignore
the overall coefficient,

113
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.710
it's not really important for
the following.

114
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:43.353
So now, let me just erase this and
get rid of this Gaussian integral, so

115
00:07:43.353 --> 00:07:50.890
now we're going to interpret actually this
Fourier transform in an interesting way.

116
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.940
So, the reason we have constructed
this initial condition

117
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.120
in this form was because we
wanted to localize our particle.

118
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.090
Sort of from a certain length scale of.

119
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:08.370
So the uncertainty of our initial
condition in real space is.

120
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.560
But by looking at this sort of wave
function and the momentum space,

121
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.610
we see that the uncertainty in momentum
delta b, A is a quarter h bar over d.

122
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:21.820
So it's inverse proportional to
the utilization in real space.

123
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.230
And so this sort of dual relation, so
the more it's localized in real space

124
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.910
the less it's localized in the momentum
space and vice versa, is a particular

125
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.310
manifestation of what is known as a
general Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

126
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:41.070
Which is written here, so that in general,
whatever wave function you have,

127
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.840
whatever quantum state you possible can
construct, there's always a constraint

128
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:52.290
that the uncertainty of position times
the uncertainty in momentum is larger or

129
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.800
equal than h bar,
h bar being the plane onstant.

130
00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:02.350
So now we're in the position to solve
the main technical problem that we

131
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.380
formulated in the beginning
of this segment.

132
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:06.430
That is,

133
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.980
to solve the Schrodinger equation,
the free Schrodinger equation here.

134
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.780
So Hamiltonian here is
just p squared over two m,

135
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.550
with the initial condition written as so.

136
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.574
So instead of writing it as
a Gaussian in real space,

137
00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:22.080
we' write it as a linear
combination of plain waves,

138
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.170
that was basically the Fourier
transform in the previous slide.

139
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.644
Now, in order to ride the tangent
tandem of wave function,

140
00:09:29.644 --> 00:09:32.926
we need to take into account
two simple circumstances.

141
00:09:32.926 --> 00:09:38.050
The first circumstance is the fact
the Schrodinger equation,

142
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.770
the time Schrodinger equation,
is a linear equation.

143
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.190
Which implies that if we have
several solutions to this equation,

144
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:49.720
say one, say two, say three,
etc, their sum is also solution,

145
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.320
with initial condition being simply the
sum of the first 20 initial conditions.

146
00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.072
Now the second circumstance is
we have to recall that a plane

147
00:10:00.072 --> 00:10:04.650
wave are written as so is indeed
a solution of the Schroedinger equation.

148
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.203
In some sense,
we can construct a Schroedinger equation.

149
00:10:08.203 --> 00:10:11.224
That it would give us
this guide as a solution.

150
00:10:11.224 --> 00:10:14.675
And here the epsilon of p
the energy of the electron,

151
00:10:14.675 --> 00:10:19.157
the energy of free electron and
simply equal to p squared over two m.

152
00:10:19.157 --> 00:10:22.919
Now if we take a look at
the initial condition again,

153
00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:27.721
written in this form,
we see that it's an integral over.

154
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:30.290
But integral is a sum in some sense.

155
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.050
It just happens to be an infinite sum.

156
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.930
So we can use the fact that a Schrodinger
equation's a linear equation and

157
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:40.670
write psi of x and t,
the full solution, as so.

158
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:48.390
So basically all we have to do is
replace this plane wave at t equals zero

159
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:54.275
with the plane wave at a finite time with
epsilon of p being p squared over two m.

160
00:10:54.275 --> 00:10:59.440
And so to write now the wave
function a more convenient way, so

161
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.500
what remains now is to calculate
the Gaussian integral over momentum.

162
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.810
And it can be done again using
the same identity that we used in

163
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:15.420
the previous slide, but now the parameter
alpha here is going to be d squared

164
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:21.660
over two h squared plus i
t divided by two m h bar,

165
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:26.230
and the parameter beta
now is i x over h bar.

166
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:30.520
So again,
if we use the same identity what we get is

167
00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.640
the following expression for
the wave function.

168
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:39.730
We see that this expression is
an intrinsically complex function,

169
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.940
but if we're interested just in
determining the density of our particle,

170
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.660
so where the particle is located,
so the only thing which matters,

171
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.580
as I mentioned already and we'll discuss
it in more details a little later,

172
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.620
is the absolute value of
the wave function squared.

173
00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.430
So, this absolute value
squared can be calculated,

174
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.180
again, we don't worry too much
about the overall coefficients.

175
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.860
We only look at what
appears in the exponential.

176
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:12.220
So we can write this density as
an exponential basically from here,

177
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.380
minus x squared over t squared
where there is also another term,

178
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:22.470
which is one over one plus t squared or
tau squared.

179
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.950
And tau here is exactly the timescale
we discussed in the beginning, which

180
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.840
is mass times the delocalization length in
some sense, d squared divided by h bar.

181
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:39.120
So this completes the derivation of the
main result that we discussed earlier and

182
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.090
also completes the first lecture.

183
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.120
Thank you very much.

184
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.247
And I will see you in
class later in the week.
