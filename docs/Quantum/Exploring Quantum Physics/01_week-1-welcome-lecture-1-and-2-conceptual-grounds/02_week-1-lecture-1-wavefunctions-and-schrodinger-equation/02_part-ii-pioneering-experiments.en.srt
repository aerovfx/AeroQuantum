1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,283
Nowadays we don't really
have to search too hard for

2
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:05,278
a motivation to study quantum physics.

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,111
There are plenty of experiments happening
around the world every day which exhibit

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,250
quantum effects.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,010
But the situation of course was quite
different about 100 years ago or so

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,598
when quantum physics was born.

7
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:21,100
When people couldn't rely on such
sophisticated techniques and

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:25,210
methods, and manifestations of quantum
physics were very, very subtle.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,338
In this video, I'm going to discuss
two such pioneering experiments.

10
00:00:30,338 --> 00:00:34,819
But before going to this part, let me
tell you a little bit about the mood of

11
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:39,231
the scientists back then on the eve
of the discovery of quantum physics,

12
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,970
which in fact was very pessimistic.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,635
In that people believed that there was
nothing else but classical science and

14
00:00:46,635 --> 00:00:51,024
Maxwell's equations and
Newton's equations and Newtonian gravity.

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:56,050
So to illustrate this, I here present two

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,630
quotes by very influential scientists,
Albert Michelson and Lord Kelvin.

17
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,140
For example, Albert Michelson in
1894 at the dedication ceremony for

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,910
a physical laboratory at the University
of Chicago said the following.

19
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,190
The more important fundamental laws and
facts of physical science have all been

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,760
discovered, and these are now so firmly
established that the possibility of their

21
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,205
ever being supplanted in consequence of
new discoveries, is exceedingly remote.

22
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:28,135
A little later Lord Kelvin says literally,

23
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:30,795
there is nothing new to be
discovered in physics now.

24
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:33,505
All that remains is more and
more precise measurement.

25
00:01:34,575 --> 00:01:39,205
So you can see that even the most famous
and the most influential physicists didn't

26
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:43,300
believe that there was anything new there,
and they didn't expect anything new.

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,360
As a side comment here,

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,320
let me mention that Michelson actually
received the 1907 Nobel Prize in physics

29
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,750
for his groundbreaking experiments on
the measurement of the speed of light,

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,670
which laid the foundation
of the relativity theory.

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,940
So he obviously was proven
by wrong himself actually,

32
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,250
but back in the end of the 19th century,
he and

33
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,120
Lord Kelvin where not the only one
thinking in this pessimistic way.

34
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,250
So the reason for
this was a lack of obvious experiments

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,380
available at the time that couldn't
be explained by the classical theory.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,811
So in some sense you may say,
that the situation was similar to what's

37
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,568
going on now actually with
the large Hadron Collider at CERN.

38
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:30,708
Where all experimental data,

39
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:35,564
including the discovery of the God
particle, or Higgs Boson last year

40
00:02:35,564 --> 00:02:39,950
are actually consistent with
the so-called standard model.

41
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,330
So hopefully the situation
will change soon and

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,810
there will be some
exciting new discoveries.

43
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,720
Just like it did change
back 100 years ago or

44
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,860
so when a few elephants sort
of entered the classical room.

45
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,430
By which I mean, experimental data that
couldn't be explained by classical theory.

46
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:02,538
So here I present a list
of a few such experiments.

47
00:03:02,538 --> 00:03:06,310
And two of them we're going to
discuss later in this segment, but

48
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,725
among them is black-body radiation,
quantization of atomic spectra,

49
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,940
which we'll talk about
later in the course.

50
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,220
The photoelectric effect, which showed
that under certain circumstances

51
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,560
light can behave as a beam of particles.

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,190
And also there was another very curious
and interesting in its history experiment,

53
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,362
which I refer as accident in Bell Labs,
shows electrons behave like waves,

54
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:33,710
which normally goes under
the name of electron defraction.

55
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,070
So I will now discuss in
detail these two experiments.

56
00:03:39,455 --> 00:03:41,950
Philipp Lenard was a German physicist and

57
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:48,440
the winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize in
physics for his work on cathode rays.

58
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,880
But back in the beginning of the 20th
century, he was studying how

59
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,998
ultraviolet light interacts with metal
by knocking off electrons from it.

60
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:04,276
This effect originally was discovered
actually by Hertz in 1887.

61
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,791
It's now called the photoelectric effect,
but

62
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:09,920
originally it was actually
called the Hertz effect.

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,780
So here I present a schematic of Lenard's
experiment copied from his original paper

64
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,200
published back in 1902,
that is the year here.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,980
In this experiment,
he had two metal plates.

66
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:27,051
Here is the left plate and the right
plate connected by an electric circuit,

67
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:30,710
so we should imagine having
an electric circuit here.

68
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,889
And one could adjust
voltage across the plates.

69
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:41,109
So in the photoelectric effect,
light comes in from

70
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:47,060
a source somewhere here and
illuminates a metallic plate.

71
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,760
So under certain conditions
that we'll discuss in a second,

72
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,670
electrons are emitted from the metal.

73
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,420
And if their energy is large enough to
overcome the potential difference here,

74
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,800
they reach the right plate,
which effectively closes the circuit and

75
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,510
results in a measurable electric current.

76
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,550
So by adjusting the voltage
across the plates,

77
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,130
one can measure the energy of
the immediate electrons this way.

78
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,770
So what's very important is that if we
rely on the classical theory of light,

79
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,510
which views it as an electromagnetic wave
of this sort, here's an expression for

80
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,230
the electromagnetic wave, which we will
see actually pretty often in this course.

81
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,950
So the classical theory
would clearly predict,

82
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,410
and this is very important,
that increasing the intensity of the light

83
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,555
should lead to more
energetic photoelectrons.

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,870
So the more intense the light,

85
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,929
the higher the voltage that
the electrons would be able to overcome.

86
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,430
Also the classical theory would
predict that intense light of

87
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,780
any frequency should be able to kick
some electrons off of the metal plate.

88
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,030
So these are very clear cut predictions,
and

89
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,490
there was no way around them and
the framework of classical physics.

90
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,400
However, this was not all what Lenard
observed actually in his experiment.

91
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,580
As a matter of fact, his experiment
observed exactly the opposite.

92
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,340
So first of all the energy of the emitted
electrons didn't depend at all on

93
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,620
the intensity of the light,

94
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,820
which he was in sharp contradiction
with the classical physics.

95
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,236
And also very importantly,
no photoelectrons were produced if

96
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:27,256
the frequency was smaller than
a certain critical value.

97
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:30,534
So the frequency of the light was
smaller than some omega critical,

98
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:31,570
there was nothing.

99
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,729
No effect whatsoever, the electrons
didn't reach the right plate.

100
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,040
And so
this was a major mystery at the time, and

101
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,320
got actually Albert Einstein
thinking about it.

102
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,900
So it's probably not very surprising
that this mystery attracted Einstein's

103
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,310
attention, as he was obviously thinking
about the properties of light at the time,

104
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:50,830
as we know.

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,630
So, three years after Lenard's
paper in the year of 1905,

106
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,370
which is often called the miracle year,
because in 1905 Einstein wrote

107
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,130
four amazing papers that have completely
redefined the foundations of physics.

108
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,380
And one of these papers is this paper
that we're now discussing concerning

109
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:15,580
an heuristic point of view toward
the emission and transformation of light.

110
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,070
So in this paper, Einstein basically
introduced the notion of a photon,

111
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,740
which resolved the mystery
of Lenard's experiment.

112
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,606
So here I have a long quote
from Einstein's paper.

113
00:07:29,606 --> 00:07:31,420
These are Einstein's words in the paper.

114
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,040
So let me read it.

115
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,990
The usual conception that the energy of
light is continuously distributed over

116
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,050
the space through which it
propagates encounters very

117
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,690
serious difficulties when one attempts
to explain the photoelectric phenomena.

118
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,480
As has been pointed out in
Herr Lenard's pioneering paper,

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,600
the one we discussed
in the previous slide.

120
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,276
And then he goes on to the main
concept of the photon.

121
00:07:53,276 --> 00:07:57,385
So according to the concept that the
incident light consists of energy quanta,

122
00:07:57,385 --> 00:08:00,268
however one can conceive of
the ejection of electrons by

123
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:02,480
light in the following way.

124
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,760
Energy quanta penetrate into the surface
layer of the body, and their

125
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,030
energy's transformed, at least in part
into kinetic energy of electrons, etc.

126
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,580
Notice that Einstein didn't really
call his proposal a theory,

127
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,600
but rather an heuristic point of a view,
which it was.

128
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,630
It was more a quantitative picture, but
a very important one because it introduced

129
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,177
the notion of photon, a particle of
light carrying a quantized energy.

130
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:33,900
And so here is, I show a little animation
which illustrates sort of Einstein's

131
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,580
view of what might be happening
in the photoelectric effect.

132
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,201
In this picture, we have this particle.

133
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,481
So let me play it once again.

134
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:46,156
We have these particles which
essentially represent light, and

135
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:50,780
each particle of light, each photon,
interacts individually with electrons.

136
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,630
And therefore, only if the energy of a
single photon exceeds a certain threshold,

137
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,290
photoelectric effect would occur.

138
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,860
And also, this picture explained

139
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,298
why the effect was not dependent on
the intensity of light, or in other words,

140
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:08,240
on the number of photons heating
this surface for a unit of time.

141
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,809
So another important element of the theory
was the assumption that the frequency

142
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:18,646
of the light, lambda here,
was proportional to the energy.

143
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:21,751
And the coefficient of proportionality
become the energy, and

144
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:23,617
omega we now know is a blank constant.

145
00:09:23,617 --> 00:09:26,998
So there's actually going to be
two notations for Planck constant.

146
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:28,756
We use h and h bar.

147
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:32,405
So h bar we're going to use
a little more often, and

148
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:37,306
the relation between them is just
this numerical factor of 2 pi.

149
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:38,326
So in this picture,

150
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:41,680
basically it was clear why
the frequency of the light was the key.

151
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,380
So the frequency of the light was related
one to one to the energy of these photons,

152
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,360
and electrons would either be able
to overcome the voltage here or

153
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,030
not, depending on whether or
not the frequency was high enough.

154
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:01,080
And this essentially resolved the mystery
behind the photoelectric effect.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,720
So an interesting comment here is that
Einstein received his 1921 Nobel Prize in

156
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,950
physics mostly for
his work on the photoelectric effect.

157
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,470
Here is actually a citation for
the Nobel Prize.

158
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,690
Actually, I think it's fair to say that
for as important as this insight turned

159
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,500
out to be, the theory of photoelectric
effect, his other achievements

160
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,239
in developing special and general
relativity are even more impressive.

161
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
So finally,
let me mention here that ironically,

162
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,248
Einstein being one of the pioneers
of quantum theory, actually remained

163
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:42,531
skeptical of quantum mechanics throughout
his life and never fully accepted it.
