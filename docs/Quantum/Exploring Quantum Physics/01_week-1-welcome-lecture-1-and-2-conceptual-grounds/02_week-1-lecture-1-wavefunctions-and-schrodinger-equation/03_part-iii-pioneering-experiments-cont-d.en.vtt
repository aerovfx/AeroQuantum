00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.300
Well the photoelectric effect,
clearly suggests that the light,

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.550
sometimes can behave as
a beam of particles.

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.200
The other players in the effect,
the electrons,

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.620
were not really suspected to represent
anything but particle-like entities.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.460
However, this letter picture was too,

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.010
questioned by a number of theorists back
in the beginning of the last century.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.880
Another theory by Prince Louis de Broglie,

8
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.190
who suggested that massive particles
can sometimes behave as waves.

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.260
He was also a bit off, in thinking
that the photon also has a mass but

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.610
apart from this idea that
didn't quite work out.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.688
His other hypothesis
turned out to be correct.

12
00:00:42.968 --> 00:00:44.582
But it was actually serendipity,

13
00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.620
that plays such an important
role in physics sometimes.

14
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.140
That produced the clearest experimental
results, that confirmed De Broglie's

15
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.330
hypothesis, and put a nail in
the coffin of classical physics.

16
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.020
So let me tell you about this
experiment and actually,

17
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.789
a rather curious story behind it.

18
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.610
In April of 1925, these two gentlemen,
Clinton Davisson and

19
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.240
Lester Germer, were working in
a physics lab at the Bell laboratories.

20
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.100
And they were studying how electrons
skitter off a nickel target.

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.510
They probably didn't expect
any groundbreaking results

22
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.220
when they started this experiment.

23
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.030
And their initial results, as a matter of
fact, were consistent with their sort-of

24
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.079
boring expectation of a diffusive
scattering of electrons off of the target.

25
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.640
So here is the diagram of the paper,

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.380
which shows from the original paper
they eventually published in 1927.

27
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.400
Which shows the apparatus they used.

28
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.980
So here we have this part,
which is a gun, electron gun,

29
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.860
which shoots electrons towards the target.

30
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.399
And so, this part is a nickel
target they were studying.

31
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.700
So another part of the apparatus is
this detector, which detects electrons.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.880
And they can look around and by doing so,

33
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.930
they can study the angular distribution
of the scattered electrons.

34
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.150
However, what this diagram and
the paper don't discuss and

35
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.539
don't show,
is the full history of the event.

36
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.280
Namely, the diagram doesn't show a bottle
of liquid air that was sitting nearby.

37
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.320
And which exploded, due to the heat
coming from this target presumably.

38
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.810
And so, this air and
this smashed vacuum chamber surrounding

39
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.870
this apparatus and the air,
rushed into the chamber.

40
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.470
Oxidizing, here they're
oxidizing the nickel target.

41
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.200
So this was unpleasant by itself perhaps,
but it also made

42
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.790
the target they were using completely
useless for other experiments.

43
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.370
Because it was completely oxidized, so

44
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.010
Davisson and Germer decided to save
the target by hitting it up and

45
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.470
by annealing it to get rid of the oxide.

46
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.910
So they did so and
put it back into the chamber and so,

47
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.810
they repeated their experiment
with the new target.

48
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.790
Well, with the old target but
which had been annealed.

49
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.960
But to their amazement, the picture of
the scattered electrons that they saw

50
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.180
was completely different from the picture
they had seen before the accident.

51
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.050
But why did the results change?

52
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.760
What was different?

53
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.490
In trying to resolve this mystery,
Davisson and

54
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.990
Germer examined the nickel target a little
closer and concluded that heated it up.

55
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.170
Annealing it,

56
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.970
resulted in this transformation
from a fully crystalline form.

57
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.940
Which basically implies a number of small,

58
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.080
small crystals put together
in a random fashion.

59
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.431
To a few single crystals with
a perfect crystalline order inside.

60
00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:04.530
So explained the new results,
but what are those new results?

61
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.370
So instead of a random blob of scattered
electrons, they now saw clear peaks.

62
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.690
Corresponding to the electron

63
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.418
beams reflected from the crystal
at certain specific angles.

64
00:04:15.418 --> 00:04:20.650
And these were strongly dependent on
the energy of incoming electrons.

65
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.290
So this plot here, is actually a plot from
the original paper by Davisson and Germer.

66
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.810
And it shows so-called scattering curves,
for what they called the 54 volt and

67
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.620
55 volt electron beam.

68
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.000
Those numbers refer to
the energy of electrons.

69
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.140
Perhaps a more illuminating,
modern feature

70
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.800
of this same phenomenon they discovered
is of course a different experiment.

71
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.670
With maybe different material but

72
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.460
the same phenomenon, now known as
electron diffraction, is presented here.

73
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.460
And so what is remarkable here is,

74
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.180
that this time phenomenon is something
that only waves can exhibit.

75
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.230
Upon propagation through
a regular array of scantron.

76
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.450
So these bright spots here correspond
to the directions along which

77
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.310
the intensity of this scantron
electron beam is high.

78
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.260
And so, this phenomenon is known and
here, is a reminder or a, of this picture.

79
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.950
So if we send a wave towards a crystal,
depending on the angle,

80
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.560
the reflected waves from different layers.

81
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.330
They can either enhance each other,
if they appear in phase or

82
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.270
they can appear out of phase.

83
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.300
In which case,
they will cancel each other out and

84
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.510
this will correspond to sort
of dark regions in this plot.

85
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.310
And while this had been known before
Davisson and Germer's experiment,

86
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.910
and they readily recognized it.

87
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.260
And found that their
data made perfect sense

88
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.509
if the hypothesis were to be accepted.

89
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.010
And so, they actually it's the same,
their paper exclusively,

90
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.880
here's a quote from the paper.

91
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.680
The most striking correct
characteristics of this beams is,

92
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.710
the one to one correspondents.

93
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.570
which the strongest of them
bared to the beams that would be

94
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.800
found issuing from the same crystal.

95
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.910
Even in incident beam,
break beam of X-Rays.

96
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.560
So, they're saying if they were to sketch
our x-rays of the same free cells,

97
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.370
they would show the same picture.

98
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.350
And finally, they say this, so

99
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.220
their data made sense, if it involves
the association of a wavelength.

100
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.070
With the incident electron beam,
and this wavelength turns out to be

101
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.960
in acceptable agreement
with the value of h/mv.

102
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.700
H being the Planck's action, constant
divided by the momentum of the electron.

103
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.250
So this was a rather remarkable, very
fabrication of Prince de Broglie ideas.

104
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.130
And the main equation,
which again, is this equation,

105
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:49.070
which relates the property
itself of particle.

106
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.300
With the mass moving
a certain velocity to a wave

107
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.660
that would be associate
with this particle.

108
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.770
And these ideas brought him a Nobel
prize just four years later.

109
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.460
So to summarize,

110
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.910
let me just tell you what we've learned so
far in the last two segments.

111
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.660
So far in the first lecture,

112
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:15.460
we have talked about two
Nobel-prize winning works.

113
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.950
The photoelectric effect and
the electron diffraction and all in all,

114
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.550
we met in passing at least six Nobel
laureates in our first lecture.

115
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.810
Feynman, Michelson, Lenard, Einstein,
Davisson, and De Broglie, so not too bad.

116
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.320
And we have seen and
these are basically the main

117
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.170
conclusions from the two
experiments we just discussed.

118
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.630
We have seen that there is a clear
experimental evidence that light,

119
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.810
behaves sometimes as a beam of
particles carrying energy quanta.

120
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.650
And the frequency released
to the energy as so, or

121
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.670
the wave length of why it
released to the energy.

122
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.422
According to this expression where or
proportionality is the blank constants.

123
00:07:54.422 --> 00:07:56.680
So here, there's a frequency of light,

124
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.680
cease the speed of light and
is the wave length.

125
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.990
So in other hand, there's also evidence
that electrons are messy particle but

126
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.170
sometimes behave as their relation.

127
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:12.250
If we just discuss it about relations and
in the next lecture,

128
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.070
we'll try to figure out
what is going on here.
