00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.010
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.290
Up to this point in the course Charles and

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.140
Di have presented already a lot
of material which included

4
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.420
both material that can be found in
traditional quantum mechanical textbooks.

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.770
And also some nonstandard
exposure to quantum physics.

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.939
For example,
super conductivity pet integrals.

7
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.240
Some elements of quantum liquidation etc,
etc.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.040
And I have to say that on my side
the preference has been for the latter.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.610
I wanted to tell you more about

10
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.720
things that you cannot find
in traditional textbooks.

11
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.780
But today is certainly going to be
an exception because today I'm going to

12
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.665
present a very traditional quantum
mechanical problem that no

13
00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:48.780
reasonable quantum
mechanical course can avoid.

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990
And this is the problem of
an harmonic oscillator.

15
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.300
So the reason I cannot avoid
this problem is two-fold.

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.800
So first of all quantum harmonic
oscillator the problem of quantum harmonic

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.070
oscillators relevant to a variety of
various experimental systems ranging from

18
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.620
atoms where atoms are trapped in
a quadratic potential to let's say

19
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.887
molecules who's low energy oscillations
I described by [INAUDIBLE] oscillator

20
00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:23.740
to quantization of [INAUDIBLE] to
quantization of oscillations in crystals.

21
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.200
So for [INAUDIBLE] we are going
to discuss them soon.

22
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.320
And many, many other things.

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.680
And second, so
the problem on the theoretical side,

24
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.190
the solution to the problem, a harmonic
oscillator is very illuminating and

25
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.770
useful in that it gives
you very useful tools.

26
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.630
So called creation and
undulation operators that

27
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.610
are useful in a variety of contexts
across various fields of physics.

28
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.430
And you're going to see these things very
often in other courses if you pursue

29
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.430
physics studies.

30
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.630
But before solving the quantum
harmonic oscillator problem,

31
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.420
let me remind you the story behind
the classical harmonic oscillator.

32
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.270
And here I have an example of
a classical system which exhibits

33
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.680
these small oscillations in year and
equilibrium position and

34
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.450
these oscillations exactly
are the harmonic oscillator motion.

35
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.790
So, on the mathematical
side what happens here,

36
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.400
of course,
is that the mass here experiences

37
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.620
the so-called Hook's force which is
proportional to the displacement,

38
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.050
x, of the spring relative to
its equilibrium position.

39
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.510
So, let's say here,
if this is my X-axis, and

40
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.810
let's say we have an equilibrium position
somewhere here, so this is my zero.

41
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.660
So, this is X, and the force is
proportional to this displacement, and

42
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.900
in this case, at this moment in time,
it's this Hook's force.

43
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.880
In these directions,
in the negative x direction.

44
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.510
Now I can write this words of
course as a minus gradient,

45
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.680
in this case its just one
dimensional gradient, or

46
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.500
just the [INAUDIBLE] with
respect to x of some potential.

47
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.870
And to produce a linear
force of course I need

48
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.220
to differentiate the quadratic potential.

49
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.070
So in this case it's kx
squared over two and

50
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.410
this is exactly the potential
energy of a harmonic oscillator.

51
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.500
That eventually is going to appear
in our Schrodinger equation,

52
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.100
the quantum version of this problem.

53
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.440
Now, the classical side though, what I
have to do is I have to solve the second,

54
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.380
Newton law, represented here.

55
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.770
And so the second Newton law,
of course is just mass times acceleration.

56
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.580
The second derivative of x
is equal to all the forces.

57
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.870
In this case, there is just one force,
in this example, is if we ignore gravity.

58
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.580
Which is not going to modify too much.

59
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.230
But in this case it's going to
be just one force which

60
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.780
is the force due to the Hook's law.

61
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.130
And if I write this equation, if I divide
this equation by m and instead of writing

62
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.280
the second derivative, I will write it in
the compact form as with two dots on top.

63
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.130
So I can write it as x to dust
plus an ingenuous squared x

64
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.740
is equal to 0 where Amanda is equal
to the square root of key over m.

65
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.170
And as solution to this
differential equation is the sines

66
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.066
or cosines to some arbitrary phases and

67
00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:42.410
it's up to us which solution to choose.

68
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.430
So there will be a some amplitude here
amplitude here so we can choose a sin or

69
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.010
we can choose a cosine.

70
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.500
And as long as we have two free parameters
which will determine the initial

71
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.470
condition, the initial position,

72
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.330
the initial velocity these are all general
solution of this classical problems.

73
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.380
So let me choose for example the sin
solution and present it here.

74
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.103
So this is this solution to
this harmonic oscillator.

75
00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:14.835
Now to move further, let me choose
a particular initial condition

76
00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:19.564
which I can do which creates response
to x of t equals 0 being 0, so

77
00:05:19.564 --> 00:05:23.956
let's say the initial moment of
time are the position of our on

78
00:05:23.956 --> 00:05:28.518
harmonic oscillator was exactly
the equilibrium point just for

79
00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:32.014
simplicity and
in this case this is my solution.

80
00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:37.508
Now if I want to find the velocity of
the oscillator as a function of time so

81
00:05:37.508 --> 00:05:41.890
all I have to do is to
differentiate the position.

82
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.690
And in this case it's
going to be just x naught,

83
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.974
some amplitude of the oscillations
times omega times cosine of omega t.

84
00:05:48.974 --> 00:05:54.139
So what I can do now, I can write
the energy of this system which is not

85
00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.216
a function of time as we shall see
in accordance to the conservation

86
00:05:59.216 --> 00:06:04.110
law which would be a sum of the kinetic
energy mv square over 2 and

87
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.490
the potential energy v(x).

88
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.433
Which is equal to one-half kx squared,
k is the coefficient in the coefficient

89
00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:15.670
in the Hook's Law or expressing it
through the mass and frequency.

90
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:16.850
I can write it as so.

91
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.580
One half, and my omega squared, x squared.

92
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.230
And this is by the way, the form in which
it typically appears in the literature.

93
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.530
In particular,
in quantum mechanic literature.

94
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.390
So now indeed if we plug in
this result into the energy.

95
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.880
And so the energy is going to be
equal to mv squared over two, so

96
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.450
we're going to have m over 2,

97
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.660
x naught squared, omega squared,
plus cosine squared of omega t.

98
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.810
From this velocity and

99
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.710
potential energy plus m over 2, x squared,

100
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.730
x naught squared, omega squared
from here Sine squared of omega t.

101
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.580
And then we can use the fact that
cosine squared a, an arbitrary angle,

102
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.830
plus sine squared of the same
angle is equal to one.

103
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:16.185
And so we see that indeed
the energy is simply this.

104
00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.575
And the energy is conserved.

105
00:07:18.575 --> 00:07:23.755
Indeed, in accordance with
the energy conservation law.

106
00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:31.420
But of course even though the energy
E here is not a function of time.

107
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.660
The two terms in this equation,
the kinetic energy and

108
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.480
the potential energy,
are functions of time.

109
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:42.980
So x is a function of time and
the velocity is a function of time.

110
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:50.270
But they work in unison with one another
in such a way that this sum is a constant.

111
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.770
And if we plot this, so let's say
the x axis here is going to be m omega

112
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.710
times the coordinate, and the y coordinate
here is going to be the momentum.

113
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.070
So we see that this trajectory,

114
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.670
basically in the phase space, describes
the motions of the harmonic oscillator.

115
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:09.959
It's a motion on a circle.

116
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.790
And the radius of the circle is
determined by the energy of our harmonic

117
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:24.500
oscillator that we, and this motion is
a face portrait of this classical system.

118
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.890
And by the way I will just mention in
passing that there is a relation between

119
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:35.170
the face portrait of classical system and
the corresponding special quantum systems.

120
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.390
But that's the only thing I'm
going to say here in this regard.

121
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.440
So now let us move closer to
the main subject of today's lecture

122
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.240
and make the oscillator quantum.

123
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.190
The motivations to do so
are many as I said, so

124
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:58.120
for example we can think about
instead of having a classical mass on

125
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.220
a classical spring, we can talk about
let's say two atom molecules and

126
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:10.640
the oscillations of this molecule relative
to the equilibrium position of the atoms.

127
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.700
So at low energies these oscillations
are going to be described

128
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.850
by quantum harmonic oscillator.

129
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.430
So of course, there are many
more examples, as I mentioned,

130
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.490
in the beginning of the lecture,
let me just mention another one.

131
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.740
So for instance,
if we're talking about the behavior

132
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:31.470
of a quantum particle in a rather
arbitrary potential, v of x.

133
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.520
Let's say something like this.

134
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.790
So if we are interested in low energy
behavior of the particles, and

135
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.530
we're near the minimum of the potential,

136
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:45.550
we can always expand the potential
of the effects near the minimum.

137
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.790
So it's going to be v of x not.

138
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:54.560
So this point, plus v prime of x not,
x minus x not.

139
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.450
And this is zero,
because this is the minimum plus

140
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:04.870
the second area over 2x over
minus x naught squared.

141
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:10.186
And model of this overall constant which
just shifts the minimum of energy and

142
00:10:10.186 --> 00:10:15.844
this shift of the equilibrium position and
this shift the equilibrium position.

143
00:10:15.844 --> 00:10:20.624
So the remaining part of
this potential is really,

144
00:10:20.624 --> 00:10:26.524
quadratic potential that we
have in the from problem.

145
00:10:26.524 --> 00:10:30.912
So what I'm saying here is that
you can always almost always

146
00:10:30.912 --> 00:10:34.338
approximate a reasonable
potential well near

147
00:10:34.338 --> 00:10:38.580
the minimum of the well with
the harmonic oscillator.

148
00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.600
You have a smooth function.

149
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.510
Of course if you have a square
quantum well we cannot do that but

150
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.080
in most cases you have
a smooth potential and

151
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.225
in this case we can just replace it at low
energies with this harmonic oscillator.

152
00:10:51.225 --> 00:10:56.695
Okay, so now let me erase this stuff,
and move further.

153
00:10:56.695 --> 00:11:02.355
So how to formally go from the classical

154
00:11:02.355 --> 00:11:06.125
harmonic oscillator in this potential
to quantum harmonic oscillator.

155
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:13.290
So to do so, we have to pretty much do
the following mathematical procedure.

156
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.920
We can just put a hat here and that's it.

157
00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.190
So that's how we make
the oscillator quantum.

158
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.750
So, well seriously what do we have to do,
we have to replace the energy of

159
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:30.100
the oscillator, so the energy remember
we derived in the previous slide for

160
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.430
the classical harmonic oscillator.

161
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.700
So now we replace the energy of
the oscillator with the Hamiltonian

162
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.560
which is an operator.

163
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:44.180
The momentum which is just a variable
in the classical description.

164
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.470
Now we replace it with the operator
that detects on the wave function and

165
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.760
in principle we can put the hat also on
top of the coordinate, although the action

166
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.290
of the coordinate on a wave function in
position space is pretty simple action.

167
00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:00.260
It's just a multiplication operator.

168
00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.520
But this pretty much what

169
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:08.380
it means on the mathematical side to
make the go from classical description

170
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.330
with no operators involved to a quantum
description with operators involved.

171
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.250
So this is the.

172
00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:18.080
And the problem that we
want to solve now is to

173
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.390
find solutions to the eigenvalue problem.

174
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:26.380
So, of course, it's a time independent
problem, so there's no time involved.

175
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.520
And what we want, we want to find
a solution to this equation.

176
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.990
So when solving this Shrodinger equation,
and

177
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:40.140
in particular when thinking
about the allowed energy levels.

178
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:45.050
So what we should keep in mind about
this harmonic oscillator potential

179
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:50.060
is one property that makes it very
different from what we have seen before.

180
00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.190
Namely that this potential grows,
the potential energy

181
00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:01.940
grows indefinitely to infinity as x
becomes very large or very negative.

182
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.070
So there is no room here for

183
00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:07.660
a plain wave-like solutions
propagating to infinity.

184
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:13.100
And the only thing we may have here
are discrete states corresponding to

185
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.910
particles localized in the vicinity
of this x equals zero.

186
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:25.510
And to determine these energy levels, this
harmonic oscillator spectrum, is exactly

187
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.640
the main problem we're going to be
focusing on in the next couple of videos.
