1
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.780
So now we proceed with the technical
solution of the quantum

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.150
harmonic oscillator problem.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.250
And I should mention that there exist many
equivalent ways to solve this problem.

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.508
But today I am going to present a purely
algebraic solution which is based on

5
00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:21.460
so-called creation/annihilation operators.

6
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.950
I'll introduce them in this video.

7
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.540
And as you will see,
the harmonic oscillator spectrum and

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.610
the properties of the wave functions
will follow just from an analysis of

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.345
these creation/annihilation operators and
their commutation relations.

10
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.354
We're not going to even write down the
Schroedinger equation as the differential

11
00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:42.936
equation.

12
00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:46.230
We're not going to worry too much
about any boundary conditions.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.510
So these operators and their commutation
relations are going to be sufficient for

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.350
us to determine pretty much
everything we want to know.

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.150
And the problem that we're actually
solving is the eigenvalue problem for this

16
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.920
operator H with this quadratic potential
corresponding to the harmonic oscillator.

17
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.470
So again, the eigenvalue problem
is H psi is equal to E psi.

18
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.984
Now there are only three dimensional
quantities that appear in our problem

19
00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:24.580
on which our final results, in particular,
the energy spectrum, can possibly depend.

20
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.340
And these quantities are the particle
mass, the frequency of the oscillator,

21
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.740
and the Planck constant,
which is always there.

22
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.310
And it turns out that you can construct
just one parameter out of these guys which

23
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.420
has the physical dimension of energy,
and this parameter is h times omega.

24
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.720
So this has the physical
dimension of energy.

25
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.848
So whatever our spectrum is going to
look like, it must scale as h omega.

26
00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.730
It must be proportional to h omega.

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.390
So motivated by this, let me write down
my Hamiltonian H divided by this h omega.

28
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.014
And it's going to be simply I
first will write the potential

29
00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:15.466
energy term m omega x
squared over 2h bar plus

30
00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:20.868
the kinetic energy p squared
over 2m omega over h bar.

31
00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:25.590
So I just switch the order in which these
two terms appear in this Hamiltonian.

32
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.471
And the next step I'm going to use
is also going to be pretty strange

33
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:33.118
from any point of view.

34
00:02:33.118 --> 00:02:38.468
So I'm going to describe
the first term as the (square root

35
00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:43.482
of m omega over 2h bar x)
squared plus the second term

36
00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:48.730
likewise is going to be (p
over 2m omega h bar) squared.

37
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.561
And now so the reason I wrote it this
way is because I want to use an analogue

38
00:02:55.561 --> 00:03:01.240
of the following expression that
we know from elementary calculus.

39
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.940
Namely, that if we have two variables,
let's say A squared minus B squared,

40
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.240
we can write it as (A-B)(A+B).

41
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.070
Or an equivalent expression to
this involving complex numbers,

42
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.690
if we have A squared plus B squared, so

43
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.480
we can write it as (A-iB)(A+iB).

44
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.540
And when we square the imaginary constant,

45
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.520
it's going to give rise
to the plus sign here.

46
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.320
So in this expression
I'm going to associate

47
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.720
the first term with A and
the second term with B.

48
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.057
And so what I'm going to write
is going to be the following.

49
00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:45.853
So I will represent my
Hamiltonian divided by h omega,

50
00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:50.767
this energy scale in the problem,
as, well,

51
00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:55.303
this guy square root of
m omega over 2h bar x

52
00:03:55.303 --> 00:04:00.217
minus i momentum divided
by this whole thing,

53
00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:05.136
times the same thing but
with a plus sign here.

54
00:04:05.136 --> 00:04:10.150
So m omega over 2h bar x plus

55
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.516
i p over 2m omega h bar.

56
00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:19.484
At this stage I have to admit that
I have cheated very seriously

57
00:04:19.484 --> 00:04:24.110
in this derivation and
this equation contains an error.

58
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.950
And as a matter of fact, there are some
missing terms that I have omitted.

59
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.990
And in the next individual quiz,
you're suppose to catch me and

60
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.930
tell me where exactly I have cheated.

61
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.490
So hopefully most of you have
figured out where the problem is.

62
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.404
And of course, the problem is in that
the objects that appear in our quantum

63
00:04:46.404 --> 00:04:49.688
mechanical problem are not
just some variables.

64
00:04:49.688 --> 00:04:51.400
Indeed, these are operators.

65
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.670
And for the operators,
in particular for operators x and

66
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.240
p, it actually matters in which
order they appear in an equation.

67
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.350
So x times p is not equal to p times x.

68
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.740
So in other words,
these operations do not commute.

69
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.440
And so if we try to re-derive this
identity for these operators,

70
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.390
we're going to see, of course, that
they're going to be cross terms appearing.

71
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:23.788
And so therefore, there is an addition to
this guy, so let me write it explicitly.

72
00:05:23.788 --> 00:05:28.348
So these terms that I have omitted so

73
00:05:28.348 --> 00:05:35.798
it's equal to -i over 2 h bar,
the commutator of x and p.

74
00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:40.938
And so this commutator of x and
p is equal to xp-px.

75
00:05:40.938 --> 00:05:45.811
You can verify that this term
indeed appears just by expanding

76
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:48.060
this product term by term and

77
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:54.168
making sure that we've reproduced
the Hamiltonian in the left-hand side.

78
00:05:54.168 --> 00:05:59.243
One other thing that we can verify by
looking at this expression is that

79
00:05:59.243 --> 00:06:04.160
the first bracket is at Hermitian
conjugate of the second bracket.

80
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:11.967
So indeed, x and p are physical operators
and as such they are Hermitian operators.

81
00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:17.816
So x dagger is equal to x and
p dagger is equal to p by definition.

82
00:06:17.816 --> 00:06:23.066
Therefore, if I Hermitian conjugate,
let's say, the second bracket so

83
00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:27.813
x will remain x, p will remain p,
all the constants here are real and

84
00:06:27.813 --> 00:06:32.311
the only thing that's going to
happen is that i will become -i, so

85
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:36.178
we will produce the first
bracket in this expression.

86
00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:41.087
Based on this fact,
let me introduce a new operator,

87
00:06:41.087 --> 00:06:46.010
so we'll just call the second
bracket an operator a.

88
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.898
And the first bracket is going
to be Hermitian conjugate too,

89
00:06:49.898 --> 00:06:51.259
therefore a dagger.

90
00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.190
And going a bit ahead of myself,

91
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.850
let me mention that these operators,

92
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.655
a dagger and a, are called creation and

93
00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:08.020
annihilation operators.

94
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.210
And the following discussion and

95
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.480
derivation will contain
a proof that these operators,

96
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.067
these guys, indeed deserve the name
of creation/annihilation operators.

97
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.260
But to explain the reason behind
this terminology right away,

98
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.730
let me advertise the main result
before we actually derive it.

99
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:36.156
And the main result here is the energy
spectrum or the harmonic oscillator,

100
00:07:36.156 --> 00:07:41.496
which, as we shall see, contains
a series of equidistant energy levels,

101
00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:46.074
that is, energy levels such that
any neighboring pair of levels

102
00:07:46.074 --> 00:07:49.768
are separated from one
another by the same energy.

103
00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:51.932
And this energy happens to be h omega,

104
00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:55.770
exactly the energy scale
we discussed previously.

105
00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:02.160
And the energy of the ground state,
the lowest-energy state is h omega over 2.

106
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.760
And by the way, this h omega
over 2 comes exactly from this

107
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.240
additional term that we
have in this identity.

108
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.610
And so the importance of
creation/annihilation operators are in

109
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.350
the following.

110
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:20.340
So let's say if we prepare
our quantum oscillator

111
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.760
in the ground state, so let me
symbolically represent it by a dot here.

112
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.045
So let's say we have an oscillator
in the ground state.

113
00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:31.411
And if we apply a creation
operator a dagger,

114
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:36.372
it will create essentially a quantum
of energy h omega by promoting

115
00:08:36.372 --> 00:08:41.930
this oscillator from the ground
state to the first excited state.

116
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.870
If we apply it again, so then we
will go from the first excited state

117
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.260
to the second excited state, etc., etc.

118
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.270
So if we apply it, let's say,
a dagger ten times,

119
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.778
we will go from the ground state
to the tenth excited state.

120
00:08:55.778 --> 00:09:01.760
And you can probably guess that the action
of the operator a is opposite to it.

121
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.500
So if we, say, have a quantum
state with n equals 1, so this

122
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.859
is the first excited state, but line a
were going to go back to the ground state.

123
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:18.380
Okay, so essentially these operators a and
a dagger, they move us

124
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:23.420
between the states in
this energy landscape.

125
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.165
And in the next video we're going
to prove all these statements, and

126
00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:33.485
this proof will rely in a very
essential way on various commutation

127
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:37.895
relations between the operators involved
here, x, p, a, and then a dagger.
