1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:07,120
So in this last video of this lecture, I'm
going to derive the harmonic oscillator

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,790
wave functions, but I will do so without
writing down the Schrödinger Equation.

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,760
We will rely entirely on the solution that
algebraic solution I presented that took

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,990
advantage of the creation and annihilation
operator, it turns out that they are very

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,700
helpful in determining the explicit form
of the oscillator wave functions, si of x.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,240
So before we write down these wave
functions we derive these wave functions

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,840
let me summarize what we know so
far which is actually a lot so

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,880
first of all we found a way to represent
the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,420
in this compact form in terms of
this creation and operators here.

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,830
And using the algebra or the computation
relations of these harmonic oscillator

11
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:06,870
operators, we derived the energy spectrum
of the oscillator, which has this form.

12
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,168
H omega n + one half.

13
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,440
Where n = zero, one, two, etc.

14
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,730
And again, I reiterate that this spectrum
is special in that the level spacing

15
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,880
between the neighboring
levels is always the same, so

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,180
it doesn't change as we
go higher up in energy.

17
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,709
So another thing we derived, and so
here I'm being a little more specific.

18
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,870
Is that given an arbitrary icon
state of the Hamiltonian with

19
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,850
a quantum number n as here,
so we can generate the entire

20
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,920
spectrum by applying the creation
operations and alienation

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,650
operators praise the energy
of the system by h omega.

22
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,820
So we go from n to n + 1.

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,180
And in the case of normalized
eigenfunctions there appears this

24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,770
coefficient.

25
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,270
I haven't derived it in
the previous video, but

26
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,920
this is rather straightforward to do so
using the same methods.

27
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,770
And it's not in many textbooks so
I'm not going to spend time on that.

28
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,720
And likewise, given the same eigenstate n.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,430
We can find the state
corresponding to a lower energy

30
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,950
with the one less quantum of h omega
by applying this alienation operators.

31
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,980
But what we don't know at this stage,

32
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,340
we don't know an example of any wave
function explicit wave-function.

33
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,160
So.
And

34
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,630
preferably we would like to see
a wave function that's in real space,

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,550
which is more intuitive that
other sort of, let's say

36
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,380
abstract spaces that we have been
operating with so far in this problem.

37
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:46,160
So in order to find the explicit form
of an eigenfunction, let me actually

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,420
focus on the ground state that is
the lowest energy state in our problem.

39
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,630
And this eigen state as we just discussed
in the previous video is characterized by

40
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:02,070
the fact that the action of this
a dagger e on it gives simply zero.

41
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,400
Gives us it's an eigen state
with an eigen value zero.

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,810
Or the eigen energy of this
state is equal to him over two.

43
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,390
So in other words, so
the angulation operator

44
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,330
acting on this state Must produce zero and

45
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,340
we can write this operator
explicitly in real space.

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,280
So we use the definition if
we want of this a as so and

47
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,930
here what I'm going to do is
I'm going to just write down

48
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,980
explicitly the form of the momentum
operator and position operator.

49
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,800
In real space the position
operator is really simple.

50
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,070
It's just a multiplication operator,
while the momentum operator as we know,

51
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,400
is just minus i h bar d over dx.

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,490
So therefore here I will just simply
remove the measuring constant.

53
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,960
So, all in all the.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,500
Equation, so I should have written
perhaps here psi0 because I'm

55
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:10,110
specifically talking about the ground
state of the harmonic oscillator,

56
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,290
so explicitly the equation for this psi0,
therefore, becomes the following.

57
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:20,760
So we'll have this square root
of m omega over two h bar

58
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,862
x plus h over two

59
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:31,370
m omega h bar in the denominator d

60
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:36,230
over d x so which is coming
from this momentum operator.

61
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,339
And this acts on si not and
this whole thing must be equal to 0.

62
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,990
So here what I'm going to do, I'm going to
simplify this thing a little bit so

63
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm going to put the square
root here on top.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
I'm going to get rid of the factor two so

65
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,410
what I see here is that I can
introduce a new parameter.

66
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,780
But we call it x naught, which is
the square root of H divided by m omega.

67
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,090
And it appears both here and here.

68
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,950
And so this you can check that

69
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,450
the physical dimension
of the square root of H.

70
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,480
Over m Amanda is a length scale.

71
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,240
So it has a physical dimension of length.

72
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,430
So this in some sense a natural length
scale for the harmonic oscillator problem.

73
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,630
And so it is convenient therefore for

74
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,210
me to rewrite my equation as
above in the full length form.

75
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:42,540
I will write it as X over x not
plus x not times d over dx.

76
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,830
And this whole thing acts
on the wave function.

77
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,420
So it effects and we want to produce 0.

78
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,610
So now,

79
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,720
let me just rewrite this equation
in a slighty different form.

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,910
So I'm going to write dx
over dx sine prime, so

81
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:07,220
this is going to be sine prime and
put this guy in the left hand side.

82
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,030
So I'm going to have
minus x over x 0 squared

83
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,220
times sine and so I just want to
show this differential equation.

84
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,680
You can check, you can solve it formally
or you can just convince yourself

85
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,830
that the solution to this equation is Is
an exponential, it's Gaussian, basically.

86
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,570
Minus x squared over 2 x not squared.

87
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,670
So, and this is,
let me just put 0's in, in

88
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,070
here which correspond again to the ground
state and this is pretty much the result.

89
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:45,760
So, C here is a coefficient which
is determined by the normalization

90
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,940
of this wave function.

91
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,100
So again, this wave function describes
a particle in the ground state of

92
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,430
the harmonic oscillator and so
therefore, the total probability for

93
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,750
me of finding a particle somewhere
in space must be equal to one.

94
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,400
So therefore,

95
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,570
this integral from minus infinity
to plus infinity of sine r squared.

96
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,450
So I don't bother here with the complex
sines because everything is real so far.

97
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,020
So this must be equal to one.

98
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,780
And this gives me the value of the wave of

99
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,320
this coefficient that
multiplies this ground state.

100
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,870
A wave function so
let me just write it down.

101
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,405
So the C is equal to m omega over two,
I'm sorry,

102
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:36,030
pi that is pi h bar to the power 1/4th.

103
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,460
So this is the normalization coefficient.

104
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,110
But notice that we have found the ground
state wave function without actually

105
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,430
solving the Schroedinger equation.

106
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,183
We actually solved
a much simpler equation.

107
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:52,476
This first order differential equation
just by requiring that our wave

108
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:57,950
function is in state with
an value zero of this operator.

109
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,060
Okay, so this is great.

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,000
So we can now work with this
wave function if we want, but

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,720
what about the higher energy states?

112
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,780
So what we have just done
was we determined this guy,

113
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,410
the lowest energy state, so here what
I'm showing, let me just write down.

114
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:19,810
So this is, first of all, the potential
of this v of x if this is x, and

115
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,640
this levels here correspond to the energy
levels of the harmonic oscillator and

116
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,370
the lowest energy has the wave function
as so which is usual Gaussian.

117
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,540
So this is a typical Gaussian.

118
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,820
And high energy states have a more
complicated sort of texture.

119
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,540
So how do we get these eigan states?

120
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:46,920
Well, so here, we can take advantage
again of the creation operators now.

121
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,700
So as we discussed In the first
slide in this video so

122
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,940
the relationship between
the low energy states and

123
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,526
high energy states, so let's say
go from m to m + 1, we can simply

124
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:07,260
apply the creation
operator divided by n + 1.

125
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Square root of n+1.

126
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,790
So if we apply it to our in state n,
we're going to get,

127
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,300
oops there's no square root here,
there's just n+1,

128
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,460
a normalized state that
corresponds to high energy.

129
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,390
And so what we can do,
we can apply this operators.

130
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,890
let's say to our ground state.

131
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,230
So we can apply this guy.

132
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,470
As many times as we want
to the ground state.

133
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,560
For instance,
we can generate this wave function So

134
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,120
by just applying this derivative
essentially to the Gaussian.

135
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,170
And this will produce certain coefficients
in front of the Gaussian and this,

136
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,219
well not coefficients, better to say
polynomials which are functions of x and

137
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:57,376
these guys, these polynomials they
are called Hermite Polynomials

138
00:09:57,376 --> 00:10:01,909
which are special functions and
you can Google them or

139
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:06,250
you can look them up in Wikipedia and
in many books.

140
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,680
So this sort of, this solution using
the explicit form of the wave functions.

141
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,000
And the explicit form of
the Hermite polynomials appears in

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,540
pretty much any book on quantum physics.

143
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,600
And I'm not going to spend time
on discussing these details.

144
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,940
I will simply notice that you can
actually solve the Schrödinger equation

145
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,320
starting from this spectrum,
up to the ground state and

146
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,250
up to the excited state, using only
the creation and annihilation operators.

147
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,670
So there's very little inside that is
actually needed from the equation.

148
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,270
Which is in fact quite remarkable.

149
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:48,337
So in your homework, you will need to play
around a little bit with this equation.

150
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:53,974
And with this grounded state function and
I hope that you found this solution

151
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:59,173
illuminating and of course I encourage
you to look into the literature

152
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:04,134
to see more about this very important
problem of quantum physics.
