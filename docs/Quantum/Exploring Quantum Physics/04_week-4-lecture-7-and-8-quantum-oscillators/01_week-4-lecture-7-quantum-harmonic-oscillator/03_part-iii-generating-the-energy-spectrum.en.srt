1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,596
In this video,
we are going to use the creation and

2
00:00:05,596 --> 00:00:10,300
amulation operator introduced
in the previous segment

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,990
to generate the energy spectrum
of the harmonic oscillator.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,670
And this calculation as we
discussed is going to involve in

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,620
very important way calculating
various commutators of the operators.

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,480
So what we just proved in the previous
video was that the harmonic

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,020
oscillator Hamiltonian can be represented
as so, as the sum of two terms.

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,830
The first term is a dagger a, where
a dagger is this creation operator and

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,450
a is this an elation operator.

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,430
And also, there was a second
term which is proportional to

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,620
the commutator x of x and
p position and momentum.

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,770
And by the way, this commutator of x and
p is one of the so

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,050
called canonical commutation
relations in quantum mechanics.

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,310
And we actually should have discussed it
in more details earlier in the course but

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,310
better later than never.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,120
So let me just first give you
this result for this commutator.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,770
This commutator, in fact, is proportional
just to so called c number or

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:20,440
in the early quantum mechanical jargon or
in other words to the identity.

19
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,480
So in other words this commutator
effects and p is not an operator at all.

20
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,310
It's actually just a constant and

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:32,460
to see this we can go to
the position representation and

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,285
let see in position representation x times

23
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:43,910
p on the wave function side of x is

24
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,780
equal to x which is just
multiplication of greater followed by

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,170
minus i h bar over the x.

26
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:00,365
And so what we're going to
have is minus ih bar sin x.

27
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:04,350
Sin prime.
So this is the result of the action of

28
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,290
these two operators in this order.

29
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,820
Now if we consider a different order
of the operators, if we first put you

30
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,700
know x is going to act first and
then we're going to have the momentum.

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,881
So in this case we can write it as full,

32
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:26,258
it's going to be minus i h
bar g over the x times sum.

33
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:31,138
So in this case we have to use
the general to calculate the derivative

34
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:33,458
of both terms in this problems.

35
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:38,261
So it's going to involve
therefore minus i h bar

36
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:44,328
derivative of x is just one side
minus i h bar x sin prime and

37
00:02:44,328 --> 00:02:48,248
now if we put everything together and

38
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:54,571
apply this commutator into
an arbitrary function psi of x,

39
00:02:54,571 --> 00:03:01,399
so let me actually write it in red
if we now have commutator of x and

40
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:05,598
p sort of acting on a wave function sin.

41
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,604
So what it means is that we want to act by

42
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:14,128
the following operator
x p minus p x on psi.

43
00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:19,418
And so we essentially have to
subtract result from this result and

44
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:23,744
so these two guys are going to
cancel each other out, and

45
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:28,288
the only thing which is going
to remain is plus i h bar si.

46
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:33,988
So action of the commutator of position
momentum on an arbiter function

47
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:38,938
psi of x is equivalent of multiplying
this function by i h bar.

48
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:44,110
Which is exactly the result that I
advertised in the beginning, and

49
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,190
this is again perhaps most of,
many of you already knew it so this is

50
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,840
again one of the canonical commutation
relations in quantum mechanics.

51
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,730
Now to continue this algebraic exercise
in calculating commutators, let me now

52
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,755
calculate a very useful commutator for the
namely the commutator of a and a dagger.

53
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:13,860
And this is another sub-canonical
commutation relation.

54
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,050
Let me write the result first.

55
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,720
I'm going to prove it and
we will see that the commutator of a and

56
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,380
a dagger is that is it
going to be equal to one.

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,229
So to prove this we use the definition of
a and a dagger from the previous video and

58
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,268
this permutation relation of position and
momentum.

59
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:41,260
So if we calculate a and a dagger,
the commutator of a and a dagger.

60
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,298
So we will have basically
two types of terms.

61
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:51,753
So here we're going to have m omega
2 h bar x plus ip 2m omega h bar,

62
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:56,657
and the second term in this
commutator is going to be

63
00:04:56,657 --> 00:05:01,938
the same thing but
with a minus sign in front of the i.

64
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:08,630
So here it is.

65
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,910
And we'll see that we have
commutator of x and x.

66
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,720
We have commutator of p and p.

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,390
But of course the commutator of
an operator with itself is equal to zero

68
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,610
because of course for example x,
x minus xx is equal to zero, right.

69
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,656
So any operator can be used with itself.

70
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,838
So the only commutators
that are going to be non

71
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:32,470
trivial are going to be these cross
commutator of x and p and p and f.

72
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,320
And you can convince yourself
that the commutator of x and

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,910
p is of course equal to the minus
of the commutator of p and x.

74
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,240
Because we simply switched the order
in which the operators appear.

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,700
So therefore we can write it so
this result, so

76
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,690
we just go back to the blue fonts.

77
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,250
So it's going to be twice let's say
the commutator of this guy and this guy.

78
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,500
So m omega over 2h bar
from this term minus i 2m

79
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,650
omega h bar from this guy and
here we're going to have x and p.

80
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,028
But this is something we know,
we just calculated it.

81
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:18,812
So this is just commutation
relation position of momentum,

82
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,978
and it's equal to i a h bar.

83
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:26,108
And so indeed, if we put everything
together, we will see that m and

84
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:32,430
omega cancel here, so h bar and
h bar under the square root cancels here.

85
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,290
So, i times minus i gives us 1 and
2 over 2 is equal to 1.

86
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,440
So, all in all,
it's equal to 1 as advertised.

87
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,140
So, and this completes
a very important derivation,

88
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,030
namely the derivation of the following
identity and it's an operator identity.

89
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,070
It doesn't really matter
what representation we use,

90
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,040
what kind of methods we want to solve.

91
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,200
We have proven that the harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian, so

92
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,790
I can actually switch to red, the harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian as written here

93
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:12,910
can be represented as H omega a dagger a,
plus one half.

94
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:18,219
So this is from this
commutator where the a and

95
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:21,170
a dagger commute to one.

96
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,820
Or in other words when we see the so

97
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,860
this creation operators satisfy
the canonical commutation relations.

98
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,752
So the second term in this expression for

99
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:37,390
the Hamiltonian as we discussed
is just proportional to a number.

100
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:44,300
So it's not, it cannot possibly affect
the solution of the eigan value problem

101
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,770
namely if we want to solve the equation
h of si is equal to e of of si and

102
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:55,900
if si happens to be an eigan
function of a dagger a so

103
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,010
it would indeed be eigan function
of the whole Hamiltonian h.

104
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,640
With this slightly shifted energy,

105
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,200
because the identity operator
just reproduces the function.

106
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:11,140
So and therefore in order for

107
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,240
us to find the spectrum of
the operator h in order for

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:20,540
us to solve this eigenvalue problem and
find the eigen functions and eigen values

109
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:26,030
we have to focus on the eigan value
problem for this operator a dagger a.

110
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:32,460
And now comes a very important part
where we're going to generate the entire

111
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:38,240
energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian from
just a single eigen state of it or

112
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,670
more precisely from an eigen
state of this guy, a dagger a.

113
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:46,790
And to generate the spectrum, we would
need just two pieces of information.

114
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,390
The fact that we can represent
the Hamiltonian as so and

115
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:56,480
the commutation relations between the and
creation operators that we just derived.

116
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,620
So at this stage, let me assume that
I know an eigan state of this guy,

117
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,140
of a dagger a, and
let me call this eigan state,

118
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,510
lowercase n and the corresponding
eigan value will also be n.

119
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:18,130
So this would also, of course, imply
that the state n is also a solution to

120
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,430
the timing depend on showing your equation
for harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, or

121
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,215
in other words it's an also an eigan
state of the Hamiltonian with the energy

122
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:36,185
omega n plus one half so
this is the energy of this state.

123
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:42,415
Now let us examine what happens
with this state we assumed

124
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:48,810
exists under the action of this
radiation and ventilation operators.

125
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,310
And of course we're very interested in,
is whether or not we can construct

126
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,630
new eigan states out of
an existing eigan state.

127
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:05,330
So first let me ast on this end by
the operator a dagger and let's see.

128
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,355
How this operator behaves with

129
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:16,450
regards to this guy, a dagger a.

130
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:21,051
So and, what we can do here,
we can take advantage of the economical

131
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:26,170
computation relations that we
derived in the previous slide.

132
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:33,140
And using this commutation relations
we can write a dagger, a a dagger

133
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,320
as one plus a dagger a.

134
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,290
So here we're going to have, so
basically we changed the order of

135
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,360
this to operators, so we're going to
have instead of a dagger a a dagger,

136
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,273
we're going to have a dagger one,
plus a dagger a.

137
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:55,410
[INAUDIBLE] n.

138
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:02,500
But, so this is just a number, and this
guy, we already know how it acts on n.

139
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,980
So by assumption,
this is an eigen state of a dagger a.

140
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,000
So therefore we can
write it as a dagger and

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,310
plus one and since this is an operator and
this is just a number,

142
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:23,940
we can exchange the order and
so we have n+1, a dagger n.

143
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,030
Which is exactly the same function
as in the left hand side.

144
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,680
So what we have proven
is that if n is an eigan

145
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,520
function of the operator, a dagger a and

146
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,650
consequently, if it's an eigan function
of the operator h, of the Hamiltonian,

147
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:49,890
then a dagger a is also an eigan function
but with an eigan value n plus 1.

148
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:55,360
So it traces the energy
off of the oscillator

149
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,080
by 1 energy quantum if
you want of h omega.

150
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,950
In a very similar way what we
can prove is the following.

151
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,418
So we can prove that if n is indeed
an eigan function of the Hamiltonian.

152
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:14,918
Then the action of
the amulation operator of n so

153
00:12:14,918 --> 00:12:20,668
this function is also an eigan
function of the Hamiltonian.

154
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:25,948
But it is negative function with
smaller energy which sort of justifies

155
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:30,528
the terminology of this being
called an amulation operator.

156
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:35,180
So, while if were to repeat this
exercise that we just did for a dagger.

157
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,654
And if we were to apply a dagger a on this
function, we would see, and I'll leave

158
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:45,838
it for you as an exercise, that this guy
is also an eigen state of a dagger a.

159
00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:49,798
But now with the smaller eigen value n-1.

160
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:53,258
And here I will have the same function.

161
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:58,104
So, by knowing an arbitrary Eigan
function of the Hamiltonian,

162
00:12:58,104 --> 00:13:00,835
I can construct an infinite number,

163
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:06,386
what seems like an infinite number of
other Eigan functions with different

164
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:11,428
Eigan values by applying this creation and
annulation operation.

165
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:15,887
And so, we can also construct the spectrum
of the Hamiltonian, but we haven't yet

166
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:18,130
mastered the question of what n would be.

167
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,220
But, with a little bit of thinking,
we can convince ourselves that

168
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,390
n here must be an integer going
from zero up to infinity.

169
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,460
Zero, one, two, three, etc.

170
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,190
And a way to see this is essentially
via a sanity check if you want,

171
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,950
going back to the physical
problem we're trying to solve.

172
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,300
So remember that what we're doing here,

173
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,150
we're trying to find the energy levels
in this harmonic oscillator potential,

174
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:53,600
which is simply the parabolic
potential proportional to x squared.

175
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,360
So this v of x proportional to x squared.

176
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,896
Now, if we assume that we know in
certain Eigan function with an energy e

177
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:08,920
sub m as so, and this is let's say,

178
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,760
this corresponds to the state n then
by applying the creation operator,

179
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,813
a dagger, we can construct
a series of higher energy states.

180
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:25,330
So n+ 1, n + 2, n + 3, etc., and
there is no problem with that.

181
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,500
But also by applying e we
can lower the energy and

182
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:35,030
we can do so seemingly indefinitely.

183
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:39,820
But clearly this procedure has to stop
somewhere because we cannot go below 0.

184
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,860
So in other words,
we cannot go below the minimum

185
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,810
of the potential which
in this case is 0 and

186
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,438
this also implies that therefore,
this procedure of generating new eigen

187
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:57,900
functions using this annihilation
operator must terminate.

188
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,260
And so there must exist, therefore,
basically the ground state for

189
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:11,600
which the action of the annihilation
operator simply is equal to zero okay.

190
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,433
Or in other words so
this guy the vacuum state is the eigan

191
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:23,400
state of this guy 8 eigan b
with the eigan value being 0.

192
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,370
Or using this a result so
the energy of the ground state,

193
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,310
therefore, is equal to h
omega over 2 which is the so

194
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,080
called vacuum energy of
the harmonic pulsalator.

195
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,750
But this is really important and

196
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,350
this tells us that this is really
the property of the ground state okay.

197
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,740
And this is by the way the simplest way

198
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,790
to find an analytical expression for
the ground state.

199
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:56,190
We simply have to find the function
that is amulated by this operator.

200
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,760
And finding this function is
really the only remaining step

201
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,560
in completing the derivation.

202
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,070
Because here we have simply done
everything which needs to be done.

203
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,100
We found a series of energy levels.

204
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,420
So let me just write it again.

205
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:18,506
So E sub n, the energy levels of
the harmonic oscillators is equal to

206
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:24,480
h omega n+1/2 where n is equal to zero,
one, two, etc.

207
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,810
And this was constructed under
the assumption that a state exists.

208
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,250
But we haven't yet
shown that it is indeed so.

209
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,460
We haven't yet
constructed explicitly the eigenstate.

210
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,910
And this is really the last piece
of the puzzle that we will put

211
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,550
together in the next video,

212
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:50,880
where we also will summarize all the
findings about the harmonic oscillator.

213
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,260
And go a little closer to physical reality
from this abstract algebraic derivation

214
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,630
which, however, I hope shows
the power of this algebraic method.

215
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,648
So here again, we are solving initially
what looks like a differential equation.

216
00:17:05,648 --> 00:17:07,208
But we get the results and

217
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:11,748
the quantization of the energies
without even calculating [INAUDIBLE].

218
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:15,368
It's all based on this
computation relations.

219
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:18,208
And, well, I find it very elegant.

220
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:22,168
And I hope that some of you
also enjoyed this derivation.

221
00:17:22,168 --> 00:17:23,688
But there is more to do.
