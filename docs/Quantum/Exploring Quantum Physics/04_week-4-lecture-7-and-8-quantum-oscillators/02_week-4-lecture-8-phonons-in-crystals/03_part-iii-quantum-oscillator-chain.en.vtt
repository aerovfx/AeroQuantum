00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.320
In this video we're going to consider the
same problem of an oscillator chain and

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.790
the collective modes in the chain.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.620
But now, we're going to start
the quantum collective modes or

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.154
quantum phonus in
a quantum oscillator chain.

5
00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.175
So, this problem solves very complicated
because we're going to be dealing

6
00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:21.365
with an infinite number of
quantum degrees of freedom now.

7
00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:26.655
But, as we shall see,
actually at the end of the day the results

8
00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.325
are going to be very similar to
those in the classical case.

9
00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:34.425
So, namely the spectrum of quantum
phonons apart from the zero point

10
00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:38.370
energy is going to be identical to
the spectrum of classical phonons.

11
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.620
Now, to solve the problem first,
we need to define what we want.

12
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.690
So, let me consider
a slightly simpler version

13
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.120
of what we looked at
in the previous video.

14
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.972
Now I'm going to study an oscillator
chain consisting of the same type of

15
00:00:53.972 --> 00:00:56.740
oscillators and same type of atoms.

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.140
So, I have here identical
atoms with a mass M, and

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.030
identical oscillators,
identical sort of springs.

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.870
Now it's going to be quantum springs
of source with a stiffness case and

19
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.980
this is the x coordinate.

20
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.350
And, the corresponding classical
Hamiltonian associated with this

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.260
oscillator chain is presented here.

22
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.660
So, we have a sum of going over
all these atoms, so and here,

23
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.890
is, let's say this is going to be N
equals one, N equals two, N equals three.

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.510
So, it just labels the atoms, and

25
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.820
axis of n is the position
of the responding atom.

26
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.208
Now this is, of course, the kinetic
energy, and this is the potential energy.

27
00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:45.420
So, it's essentially the same Hamiltonian
we had before but now just for

28
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.040
a single species of atoms if you look.

29
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.430
Now to go to quantum problem,
we need to quantize this Hamiltonian.

30
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.020
We need to make it quantum.

31
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.590
So, how do we do this?

32
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.830
Well, it turns out that
actually it very easy to do so.

33
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.390
So, it's as easy as it was in the case
of a single harmonic oscillator.

34
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.580
So, all we have to do is just to
put hats on top of h, p and x.

35
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.620
So, which means that we made these

36
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.450
variables in the classic location to
operators in the quantum problems.

37
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.170
So, for example,
if we are working in position space.

38
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.300
So let's say b sub n is simply

39
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.330
the derivative minus i h-bar G over axm.

40
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.680
So it adds solely on
the f coordinate of the.

41
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.280
Now this f and p, they satisfy
the Hamiltonian commutation relations.

42
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.760
So, if they could respond to
the same atoms, so XN and

43
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.700
PN, they commute to IH bar.

44
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.210
If they correspond to a different atom,
let's say if N is not equal to, well let's

45
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.910
see if we've XN and PN, so that's going
to be zero and is not equal to N.

46
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.500
So, we can sort of unify this
competition relation, for

47
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.420
writing the Delta symbol here.

48
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.620
So, which means that it's equal to ih bar
one if n equals to m and zero otherwise.

49
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.570
So, this is what it means to
quantize this Hamiltonian.

50
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.360
So now,
the next step we're going to perform is,

51
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.160
we're going to use our definition of
the creation and operator that were

52
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.930
introduced in the solution of
the single harmonic oscillator.

53
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.251
And, we're going to represent each
coordinate xn and momentum bn through

54
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:55.020
the corresponding creation and
annihilation operators A and A dagger.

55
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.524
So, here are the same,

56
00:03:56.524 --> 00:04:01.037
you can check going back to the first
segment of the lecture today is at,

57
00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:05.793
that as a matter of fact it's exactly
the same definitions we used before.

58
00:04:05.793 --> 00:04:06.345
But now,

59
00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:10.770
we just have this additional index N
which refers to the atoms in this chain.

60
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.850
And, of course, there's a creation and
annihilation operators.

61
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.010
They satisfy their own canonical
commutation relations as here.

62
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.670
So, they commute with one another,
their commutation is equal to zero

63
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.540
if they responded to different atoms, and
otherwise, if they correspond to the same

64
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.770
atom, a commutator with a dagger m,
is equal to one.

65
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.560
So, what we're going to do now, we're
going to plug in this expression of X and

66
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.120
P through a and
a dagger into this Hamiltonian.

67
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.740
And, let me do that.

68
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.710
So, if we do so,
the Hamiltonian takes this form.

69
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.010
Which actually appears to be a more

70
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.690
complicated looking form since there
are more terms here than we had before.

71
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.930
But, we are on our way
to solving the problem.

72
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.340
So, the strategy for solving
the problem would be actually different

73
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.240
from the sort of typical solution in
single particle quantum mechanics

74
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.380
where we're dealing with
a Schroedinger equation wave function.

75
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.210
So here, of course,
we still would like to solve

76
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.350
the Schroedinger equation we have in
mind this Schroedinger equation, but

77
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.290
we don't worry too much at this stage
about the form of the wave functions.

78
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.620
We just want to know the energies
that are possible in this system.

79
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.080
Just like in the previous video we
just worried about the spectrum

80
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.360
of the dispersion relation
of classical wave.

81
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.870
So, here we want to know the dispersion
relations for quantum waves.

82
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.260
So, how do we do this?

83
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.220
So, in order to solve the problem here,
instead of working with

84
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.110
the wave functions, we're going to be
working with the operators themselves.

85
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.660
And, we're going to try to transform
the Hamiltonian into a new, simpler form.

86
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.290
So, that basically we're going to be
looking for a new set of operators.

87
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.191
We're going to go from the operators,
let's say AN and

88
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:17.030
AN dagger with all possible N's,
to a new operator.

89
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.780
So, let me call it BQ and BQ dagger.

90
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:25.760
Such that the form of the Hamiltonian
in terms of this new creation and

91
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.670
annihilation operators is
going to be much simpler

92
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.320
that the form which is written here.

93
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.590
So, basically the challenge here
is to find a linear transformation

94
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.490
of the original operators Into a new form
such that the Hamiltonian, which looks

95
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.230
simple, and that essentially this solution
to this Hamiltonian would be known.

96
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.234
So, this is a bit of a technical
challenge and a technical exercise and

97
00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:56.040
the first step in this exercise is
just to write the Hamiltonian in terms

98
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.900
of this A and A dagger as is.

99
00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:02.240
So, we have to basically expand this
brackets and calculate this square

100
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.240
of these brackets which leads to
a rather lengthy expression that's here.

101
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.100
And.
I have omitted here and overall constant,

102
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:16.690
there could be constant which corresponds
essentially to an energy shift.

103
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.290
And also, I have written it in
a slightly more friendly form, well,

104
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.850
it's not as long as I could have
written it because of this term which

105
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.890
is a response to Hermitian conjugate.

106
00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.040
So, basically I have this guy,
so you can just work it out.

107
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.310
You can work it out as
an exercise if you want.

108
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:40.090
So, and you will see that you have many,
many churums and each churum

109
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.760
in here must be compensate with
a hermitian conjugate from somewhere else.

110
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.613
Because the Newtonian in the end of
the day must be Hermitian operator.

111
00:07:50.613 --> 00:07:55.540
So, and in this case it simplifies our
life a little bit because we don't have

112
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.240
to write two lengthy expressions,
but still it looks pretty bad.

113
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.100
So, there are a lot of
terms we don't want to see.

114
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.080
So, we don't know with this spectrum,
what the solution of this Hamiltonian is.

115
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.710
We see a bunch of this A and
A daggers in various combinations, and

116
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:12.750
we see also couplings between
different sides, etcetera, etcetera.

117
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.120
So, in order to solve this, Hamiltonian,
in the way I just described, that is,

118
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.140
to find new set of operators
that simplifies form.

119
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.290
So, just like in the classical case, it's
convenient to perform a Fourier transform.

120
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.500
But now,
it's going to be a Fourier transform, for

121
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.910
the creation and
annihilation operators themselves.

122
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:39.680
So, what we have here is a representation
of the annihilation here and the creation

123
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.340
operators in terms of some other
operators, A's of Q and A's of Q dagger.

124
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.530
So, I use the same symbols.

125
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.510
But, this is really a different operator.

126
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:55.760
And so, this a D sub Q are in
a sense images of this A sub N.

127
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.440
And so, the two are related
by this Fourier transform,

128
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.625
which now is an integral
going from minus pi to pi.

129
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:08.597
So, and it starts from minus infinity to
plus infinity because we have a periodic

130
00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:12.790
array of these oscillators,
not the continuum oscillators.

131
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.670
So, it's actually more like for
a series rather than for

132
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.930
a transform that we're using.

133
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:24.085
In any case, I'll be using this symbol
here so integral with the subscript

134
00:09:24.085 --> 00:09:29.600
W to sort of label all of
the terms that I have here.

135
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.820
And, in these notations, for example,

136
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:37.170
the Fourier-transform of the creation
operator is presented here.

137
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:42.360
So, it can be obtained from this one
simply by conjugating both sides.

138
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.300
That's why I have a minus sign here
as opposed to a plus sign here.

139
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:51.010
So, there are a couple of identities that
I want to emphasize without deriving them.

140
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:54.000
So the first one is
the sum over all integers,

141
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.860
basically over all
the oscillators in our problem.

142
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.680
And so N goes from zero plus minus one,
plus minus two, etcetera.

143
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.580
So, and if I sum over all these N's,

144
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:11.470
these exponentials will give rise
to two pi times the delta function.

145
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.850
And, sort of the inverse identity to it,

146
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:19.570
if I integrate the exponential,
from minus pi to pi.

147
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.840
So, then the right hand side
is going to be delta symbol.

148
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.450
So, this integral is equal to zero
if N is not equal to zero and

149
00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.703
is equal to one,
well [INAUDIBLE] otherwise.

150
00:10:30.703 --> 00:10:37.040
I'm mentioning these identities because
they're very useful in driving a form of

151
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.150
the Hamiltonian in the q-space
from the Hamiltonian we

152
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:47.898
derived in the previous slide in real
space which was dependant on the index N.

153
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:52.590
And, this valuation which
takes a little bit of time and

154
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.930
effort I will leave mostly to you.

155
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.249
And, this will be one of problems in your
upcoming homework for self assessment,

156
00:10:59.249 --> 00:11:03.560
and probably this is going to be
the most complicated problem there.

157
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:08.710
However, there is one important identity
of that one to prove explicitly here.

158
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.740
And, this will be an identity
involving a commutator

159
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.630
of two Q-space operators.

160
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.580
So, again, our goal would be to

161
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:25.830
rewrite the Newtonian in terms of
this A's of Q and A's of Q dagger.

162
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.420
And, I refer to these guys as
annihilation and creation operators, but

163
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.900
I haven't proven that they
are indeed such operators.

164
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.000
So, what does it mean for them to
be creation annihilation operators?

165
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.250
So, it would mean that they satisfy
certain type of commutation relations

166
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:45.050
similar to the canonical commutation
relations we have discussed

167
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.490
in the previous lecture.

168
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.680
So, in these permutation relations for
the real space operators, A sub N, or

169
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:59.890
let's say A sub N dagger, we know
that this is delta symbol of N and M.

170
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:04.300
So, now we want to check what kind of

171
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:09.170
limitation relations these guys satisfy,
and in order for me to work it out,

172
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:14.130
work out these commutation relations, I'm
going to use an inverse Fourier transform.

173
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:19.731
So, let's say the first term
in this commutation relation,

174
00:12:19.731 --> 00:12:24.315
A sub Q one,
can be written as a sum over N one..

175
00:12:24.315 --> 00:12:29.760
A sub N one into minus I Q one N one,
so this is an inverse

176
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.640
Fourier transform in some sense
opposite to this guy here.

177
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.052
And, the second term here
is going to involve sum,

178
00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:47.230
let's say over N two, A dagger N two,
either the part plus I Q two N two.

179
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:52.050
And, this responds to
the Fourier-transform sort

180
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:54.045
of reversing this relation.

181
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.558
So, now the commutator only
cares about the operator.

182
00:12:59.558 --> 00:13:02.130
So, all, and this is a linear operation.

183
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.230
So we can factor out,
in some sense, this sum and

184
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.780
we can factor out these exponentials.

185
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.590
So, derive this commutation
relation as so.

186
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.856
So, it's going to be a sum or N one and

187
00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:19.516
N two E to the power I,
Q two N two minus Q one N one.

188
00:13:19.516 --> 00:13:25.513
And, here I'm going to have the commutator
of a sub N one A dagger sub N two.

189
00:13:25.513 --> 00:13:30.884
And so, if we now compare this
canonical computation, or relation,

190
00:13:30.884 --> 00:13:35.707
with this guy, then we're going
to see that this is nothing but

191
00:13:35.707 --> 00:13:38.087
delta symbol of N one and N two.

192
00:13:38.087 --> 00:13:43.880
Which means that it sort of extracts
just one term out of this sum.

193
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.020
Where N one is equal to N two, and

194
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.600
what we can do,
we can simply set N one equals to N two.

195
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.400
And let's say, we will set N one equals
N two and equals to some other N.

196
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.818
And so,
we're going to arrive it as follows,

197
00:13:57.818 --> 00:14:00.810
it's going to be equal to the sum over N.

198
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:05.099
Now E to the power I Q
two minus Q one times N.

199
00:14:05.099 --> 00:14:09.750
And, that's it, so the operators are done.

200
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.539
And now, at this stage we're going
to use finally this identity,

201
00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:19.941
the first identity that I just defined and
we'll write the final results.

202
00:14:19.941 --> 00:14:22.600
So, we make sure we write it in red.

203
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:28.151
And, it's going to be equal to two Pi
delta function of Q one minus Q two,

204
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:29.520
Q two minus Q one.

205
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.660
So, in this to be compared with this
canonical commutation relation.

206
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.880
So, you can see, of course, here

207
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:43.060
this is in some sense a continued version
of this canonical commutation relation.

208
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:49.220
And, this means, actually, that these
guys, A sub Q one, well, A sub Q and

209
00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:55.010
A sub Q dagger, the two represent
annihilation and creation operators.

210
00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:01.150
But, what do these creation and
annihilation operators create or destroy?

211
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:03.210
So, like A sub N and

212
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:08.410
A sub N dagger, which sort of create
a local oscillations of a particular

213
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.740
side of a particular oscillator somewhere
in the well defined position in space.

214
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:18.800
So, these A's of Q, and
A's of Q dagger, they annihilate and

215
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.300
create waves that go on propagating
through the, oscillator chain.

216
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.200
So, these guys are not local in space.

217
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.140
They instead create waves
with a certain wave vector.

218
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.720
And Q basically is the wave vector.

219
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.699
So, here, again, I'm using the units
where the lengths are measured in

220
00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:40.202
the units of the oscillator length.

221
00:15:40.202 --> 00:15:44.738
So, the distance between
the neighboring equilibrium size, but

222
00:15:44.738 --> 00:15:49.960
in any case so this is really
the interpretation of what we're doing.

223
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.100
And now, if we plugin these

224
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.730
expressions into the Hamiltonian
in the previous slide, and

225
00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:04.640
we use these identities and
other simple algebraic manipulations

226
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.800
we're going to arrive at the following
expression for the same Hamiltonian.

227
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.297
So, this is actually the very same
Hamiltonian we started with, but

228
00:16:12.297 --> 00:16:15.910
now rewritten in terms of this A sub Q,
and A sub Q dagger.

229
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.740
And, while it's not at all obvious
that this is the result and

230
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.050
while this capital A and

231
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:25.180
capital B, its coefficients here have
this form, and it's not obvious at all.

232
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.680
So, this actually to derive this
guy would be a challenge for

233
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.640
you in the bonus problem
of your homework here.
