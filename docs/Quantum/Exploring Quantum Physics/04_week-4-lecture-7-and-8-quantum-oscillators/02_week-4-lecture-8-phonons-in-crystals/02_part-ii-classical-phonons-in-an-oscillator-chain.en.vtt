00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.660
In this video, I will solve the problem 
of classical crystal, or an infinite 

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.490
chain of classical oscillators. 
And I will determine the normal modes in 

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.375
this system. 
and as I mentioned, I'll do it actually 

4
00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:20.100
in the chain, which means it's in 1D. 
And I should mention that actually I 

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.450
could have done in two-dimensions or 
three-dimensions. 

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.254
It would have been a little bit more 
complicated. 

7
00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:29.959
But otherwise, actually the difference, 
the key features of the solution are 

8
00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:34.888
pretty much the same in one-dimension. 
And higher dimensions, apart from some 

9
00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:39.526
polarization effects. 
and for this reason, I will just 

10
00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:43.275
concentrate on the simpler case of 1D. 
But, you could have done it in any 

11
00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.149
dimension. 
So, the specific model I'm going to 

12
00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.784
consider is presented here. So, 
we will consider one dimensional chain.

13
00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:54.030
So, we should imagine that this infinite 

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.070
chain, actually more specifically, I will 
consider the so-called Periodic Boundary 

15
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.275
Conditions for simplicity. 
But in an infinite system, it doesn't 

16
00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:03.781
really matter. 
And so, in this chain, as you can see, 

17
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:08.553
there are two types of atoms. 
Well, these guys, the brown and red 

18
00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:14.159
circles, they correspond, well in my 
model to an atom of such 1D crystal. 

19
00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.767
And the positions of atoms will be 
labelled by x_n for lighter atoms and 

20
00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:29.086
Y_n for heavier atoms. 
And the index n here corresponds to, in 

21
00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:33.970
some sense, to an elementary cell. 
So here, at this elementary cell would be 

22
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.617
you know, one lighter atom and one 
heavier atom. 

23
00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:44.139
And, let's say the size of this 
elementary cell will be two times the 

24
00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:50.391
distance between the atoms. 
And so n can be, you know, 1, 2, 3, 4, so 

25
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:54.890
have an infinite series of these 
elementary cells. 

26
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.050
And also for the sake of simplicity I 
will be measuring the distances in the 

27
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.960
beginning of my solution in the units of 
this elementary cell size. 

28
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.720
So, I will essentially set 2a=1.

29
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.410
So, a is basically the equilibrium length 
of a spring. 

30
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.306
So, 2a is essentially represents symmetry 
of my, discrete symmetry in my 

31
00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:24.212
problems. 
So, if I translate everything by 2a, I 

32
00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:28.926
get my crystal. 
What I'm saying here is I'm going to be 

33
00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:33.423
using the units where 2a is set to 1. 
But basically, this is my problem. 

34
00:02:33.423 --> 00:02:37.230
And so, let me write down first the 
energy of this system.

35
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.210
And so, the energy is actually very 
simple to write down. 

36
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.576
So the energy, as usual, will contain
 the kinetic energy part

37
00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:47.976
 and the potential energy part. 
And so, the kinetic energy part includes 

38
00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:54.379
the kinetic energy of all light atoms. 
So this lower case p_n squared 

39
00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.268
over 2m. 
And the kinetic energy of the heavy 

40
00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:02.300
atoms, so which actually have a color 
code here, 

41
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.134
The sort of brownish font corresponds to 
terms that are associated with lighter 

42
00:03:07.134 --> 00:03:12.644
atoms, and the red font naturally 
corresponds to terms which are associated 

43
00:03:12.644 --> 00:03:15.022
with heavy atoms. 
And then, there will be potential energy, 

44
00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:17.500
which is just the usual Hook's Law if you 
want. 

45
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.735
But I now have Hook's Law for every 
single spring in this oscillator chain. 

46
00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:28.775
So for example, in this nth elementary 
cell, I'm going to have a term here 

47
00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:36.680
associated with the spring between this 
lighter atom and this heavier atom, M. 

48
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.040
And so this term essentially as is 
corresponds to this this spring. 

49
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.379
But also, there will be an interaction 
let's say, of this heavy atom with the 

50
00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.506
lighter atom from the next elementary 
cell, the nth+1 

51
00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:54.937
elementary cell. 
And so there is a term also here in this 

52
00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:59.244
Hamiltonian, this classical Hamiltonian, 
associated with this, nearest neighbor 

53
00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:01.770
interaction. 
Now, and of course, I have to sum over 

54
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.210
all these n's, and this will be will give 
me the total energy of my classical 

55
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.262
crystal. 
Now, the next step is  to actually

56
00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:18.672
solve this problem is to write down the 
equations of motion for all the particles 

57
00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:20.248
involved. 
And there's an infinite number of such 

58
00:04:20.248 --> 00:04:23.264
particles. 
And in our case, these equations have 

59
00:04:23.264 --> 00:04:25.995
motion are nothing but Newton's 
equations. 

60
00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:29.780
well, associated with each of these 
particles. 

61
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.132
And, as usual, while the Newton equation 
is m times a, my mass times 

62
00:04:37.132 --> 00:04:39.510
acceleration is equal to the sum of all 
the forces. 

63
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.540
And the force can be found by, as a 
derivative or gradient, in this case it's 

64
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.377
just one-dimensional gradient of the 
corresponding potential energy. 

65
00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:55.270
With the respect to the coordinate of a 
particle where we're investigating. 

66
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.033
And so, for instance for the lighter
 atoms, for the nth lighter atom,

67
00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:03.806
 this will be the Newton law. 
And for the nth heavy atom, this will be 

68
00:05:03.806 --> 00:05:07.512
the Newton Law. 
And so, if we just formally differentiate 

69
00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:14.248
our potential energy, we get these 
equations of motion for the lighter atoms 

70
00:05:14.248 --> 00:05:19.401
and the heavy atoms. 
And it's very natural that, there are 

71
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:24.360
two terms in each of these equations. 
Because this essentially corresponds to 

72
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.920
having two springs attached to each of 
the atoms. 

73
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.249
So, for example, here in this equation, 
we can understand the first term as being 

74
00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:39.554
associated with the force exerted on this 
heavy atom by this spring. 

75
00:05:39.554 --> 00:05:45.702
And the second term is going to be the 
force exerted on the same atom by this 

76
00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:50.352
other spring to the right. 
So and the goal now is to solve these 

77
00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:53.170
equations. 
Of course, it's an infinite chain of 

78
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.460
equations because n goes from minus 
infinity to plus infinity. 

79
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.540
So, this is an integer index which labels 
our pairs of heavy and the light atoms. 

80
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.017
So here, I'm showing the same Newton's 
Law that we derived in the previous 

81
00:06:06.017 --> 00:06:09.290
slide, but now just slightly 
reconstructed. 

82
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.510
So, I just grouped together this 2x_n 
and 2Y_n. 

83
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.020
So, of course it's a very complicated 
looking system of equations. 

84
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.640
We actually have an infinite system of 
coupled differential equations and well 

85
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.790
naively, we would you could just say that 
it's hopeless. 

86
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.820
You know, there's no way we could solve 
such a complicated model. 

87
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.064
But it turns out that using combination 
of a powerful mathematical method which 

88
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:42.760
we already used actually the fourier transform 
and a reasonable physical guess. 

89
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.200
We can solve the problem in a few 
relatively straight-forward steps. 

90
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.761
So, the method involved essentially a 
fourier transform where we represent our 

91
00:06:53.761 --> 00:07:01.751
time dependent coordinates of the light 
and heavy atoms as linear combination. 

92
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:07.130
Or an integral over a wave vector of a 
wave like excitation. 

93
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.350
So here, I have essentially a plain wave 
in one dimension. 

94
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.634
And so, remember that I introduced  
these units of 2a = 1. 

95
00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:21.255
Therefore, this wave vector multiplies 
just an integer label n, which labels my 

96
00:07:21.255 --> 00:07:29.475
coordinates of my light atoms. 
And, I represent the heavy atoms as a 

97
00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:34.380
linear combination of their own wave is 
some new amplitudes Y sub q. 

98
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:42.165
And here I use q*(n+1/2)
because this guy is shifted by 1/2 in 

99
00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:46.597
my units of length relative
 to the light atom. 

100
00:07:46.597 --> 00:07:52.952
And importantly, here I have the time 
dependence again which is consistent with 

101
00:07:52.952 --> 00:07:55.650
the wave like behavior. 
So, I assume essentially that whatever 

102
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.990
solutions there are, this solution 
represent waves running through this 

103
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:05.065
crystal. 
And now, the next step in the solution is 

104
00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:11.082
to plug in this trial functions into the 
Newton equations. 

105
00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:16.632
And to see if we can make, if we can find 
a self consistent solution, which is 

106
00:08:16.632 --> 00:08:21.283
consistent both with the Newton 
equations, and with this representation. 

107
00:08:21.283 --> 00:08:25.731
I'm going a bit ahead myself. 
I would say that, of course, the reason 

108
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:29.147
I'm presenting the solution is because we 
will indeed find that it's self-consistent.

109
00:08:29.147 --> 00:08:32.165
But the self consistency will include in 

110
00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:40.140
a very essential way a relation between 
Omega and q, between the frequency of the wave.

111
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.300
And the wave vector. 

112
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:48.347
So and this is going to be 
the dispersion of the waves, the possible 

113
00:08:48.347 --> 00:08:52.500
dispersion of the waves. 
And basically, to solve the problem in 

114
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.170
this context means to find this 
dispersion basically to find Omega as a 

115
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.590
function of q.
So now, let me consider every single 

116
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:07.616
term, let's say in the first Newton 
equation, corresponding to the light atoms. 

117
00:09:07.616 --> 00:09:10.112
So, the first term on the left-hand side 

118
00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:14.789
the second derivative of the coordinate 
with respect to the time. 

119
00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:20.128
The acceleration here is going to involve 
the integral over all wave vectors. 

120
00:09:20.128 --> 00:09:24.344
and I will just label this integral as 
as integral sub q, not to write the 

121
00:09:24.344 --> 00:09:30.136
differentials. 
and here I'm going to have x sub q. 

122
00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:34.076
And the derivative of the exponential 
with respect to time is going to produce 

123
00:09:34.076 --> 00:09:41.220
minus i Omega squared exponential of iqn 
minus i Omega t. 

124
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.658
So, this is just minus Omega squared. 
Now, I also have here this term of

125
00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:53.584
 Y_n + Y_(n+1), which essentially 
corresponds here in this picture. 

126
00:09:53.584 --> 00:09:59.354
to having this red atom to the left and 
the red atom to the right. 

127
00:09:59.354 --> 00:10:06.026
And so, if I now calculate this term,
Y_n+Y_(n-1), I simply can 

128
00:10:06.026 --> 00:10:10.980
write this expression. 
So I have an integral sub q, Y sub q. 

129
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:18.217
And here I have a sum of two terms, e to 
the power iq n plus 1 half plus e to the 

130
00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:25.135
power iqn minus 1 half. 
Because now this corresponds to n minus 

131
00:10:25.135 --> 00:10:31.261
1, e to the power minus i Omega t. 
Or I can factor out this e to the bar 

132
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:35.805
iqn, and here I will have e to the power iq 
over 2, plus e to the power minus iq over 

133
00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:39.516
2. 
And this is equal to the cosine, 

134
00:10:39.516 --> 00:10:44.616
proportional to the cosine. 
So, I can write it identically as an 

135
00:10:44.616 --> 00:10:55.284
integral over q, Y sub q, twice cosine of 
q over 2 multiplying the same exponential 

136
00:10:55.284 --> 00:11:01.090
as in this term here. 
And if I put everything together. 

137
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:06.446
So what I'm going to get is and basically 
if I focus only on the coefficients, 

138
00:11:06.446 --> 00:11:13.066
which multiply the same plane waves in 
each of these integrals, I can write 

139
00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:17.597
essentially the same Newton's Law. 
But now, in the Fourier space as minus 

140
00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:31.450
m Omega squared x sub q from this guy is 
equal to k twice Y sub q cosine q over 2. 

141
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:37.190
This term, which we just derived minus 2x 
sub q. 

142
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:45.190
And this is essentially the Newton Law 
corresponding to the light atoms written 

143
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.490
in the Fourier space. 
Of course, we can repeat the same kind of 

144
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.850
procedure for the second Newton Law for 
the heavy atoms. 

145
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:57.475
And if we do so we are going to get the 
following system of equations. 

146
00:11:57.475 --> 00:12:00.895
So, the first one we just derived, and 
the second one I didn't explicitly 

147
00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:05.850
derive, but it's derived in a very 
similar fashion. 

148
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:12.778
So and well the good thing about these 
equations first of all that instead of an 

149
00:12:12.778 --> 00:12:16.676
infinite chain of coupled equations. 
Actually just have two coupled equations, 

150
00:12:16.676 --> 00:12:19.039
okay? 
You see that of course, I have all 

151
00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:22.478
different q's involved. 
So, I can change my q, but there is no 

152
00:12:22.478 --> 00:12:26.360
coupling between different q's. 
Unlike in real space where we need to 

153
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:32.304
have coupling between neighboring size n, 
and another thing which is good is that 

154
00:12:32.304 --> 00:12:38.390
its no longer a differential equation. 
Instead of the derivative, I now have just 

155
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.780
omega squared here. 
So, it's much easier now to deal with 

156
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:48.070
this essentially linear 2 by 2 
system of equations. 

157
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:54.930
And to solve the remaining part, let me 
just rewrite the same equation in a 

158
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.140
slightly different form. 
I will write it as a matrix. 

159
00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.426
Well, it's the same equation I just had 
before, but now I wrote in a slightly 

160
00:13:00.426 --> 00:13:05.280
different way. 
I wrote it as a matrix, 2x2 matrix acting 

161
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.568
on a vector if you want, which contains 
the Fourier component of the coordinates 

162
00:13:10.568 --> 00:13:14.344
of the light atoms and the Fourier 
components of the coordinates of the 

163
00:13:14.344 --> 00:13:17.820
heavy atoms. 
And the, the right-hand side is zero. 

164
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.084
Because if we go back, we see that all 
the terms here are proportional to one or 

165
00:13:21.084 --> 00:13:25.810
the other coordinate, there is no free 
terms here which is just constants. 

166
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.008
So I can write it like that and it's 
equal to zero. 

167
00:13:29.008 --> 00:13:32.846
And maybe most of your, or some of, you 
know, from linear algebra. 

168
00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:36.674
That in order for me to be able to have a 
non-trivial solution to this equation, 

169
00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:41.956
which is not identically equal to zero. 
Basically, a solution where x and q are 

170
00:13:41.956 --> 00:13:47.174
not identically equal to zero. 
I have to ensure that the determinant of 

171
00:13:47.174 --> 00:13:51.840
this matrix, so the determinant of this 
matrix vanishes. 

172
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.600
And well this is determinant of a 2x2 
matrix, which I can calculate. 

173
00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:02.496
And well, if you do so, you will get the 
following equation, which is the 

174
00:14:02.496 --> 00:14:06.034
algebraic equation. 
And essentially, it reduces to a 

175
00:14:06.034 --> 00:14:08.850
quadratic equation. 
Well, it's, formally, it's an equation of 

176
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.795
the 4th order. 
But there is only Omega squared involved. 

177
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.228
So all, all in all, it's just a quadratic 
equation that I hope most of you know how 

178
00:14:16.228 --> 00:14:23.020
to deal with. 
And well, what is this equation for? 

179
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.260
Okay, this is again, an equation for the 
frequency. 

180
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.151
Or more precisely, for the dependence of 
the frequency on the wave vector, which 

181
00:14:31.151 --> 00:14:36.528
is known as a dispersion relation. 
Well, we have seen actually many 

182
00:14:36.528 --> 00:14:40.752
dispersion relations already in this 
course in the context of Quantum Physics 

183
00:14:40.752 --> 00:14:45.594
and also classical Physics. 
For instance, when we talk about the 

184
00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:52.683
energy of a particle, the free particle 
being proportional to p squared. 

185
00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.715
So, this is essentially dispersional 
relation, say of an electron or any other 

186
00:14:55.715 --> 00:14:58.900
free particle. 
When we talk about the dispersion

187
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:04.131
relation of a photon where Omega scales 
linearly with the wave vector. 

188
00:15:04.131 --> 00:15:08.870
This is well the dispersion relation of 
electromagnetic waves. 

189
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:14.030
So now, we have here an equation which 
determines the dispersion relation of 

190
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:18.596
elastic waves, otherwise 
known as phonons. 

191
00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:26.500
Which can exist in this sort of simple 
model of a one-dimensional crystal. 

192
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:32.910
So, now before solving this equation, let 
me go back to the sort of physical, 

193
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.090
original physical units where the 
dimension of length is restored. 

194
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:42.493
So, here we have this q, the wave vector 
which is measured in 1 over distance. 

195
00:15:42.493 --> 00:15:48.317
And remember that the convention 
was that 2a, a being basically the size 

196
00:15:48.317 --> 00:15:53.334
of the length of a spring was equal to 1. 
So, if we want to restore the right 

197
00:15:53.334 --> 00:15:59.618
physical dimension, I should multiply 
this q here by 2a and also of course,

198
00:15:59.618 --> 00:16:02.589
 1 minus cosine squared is equal to sine 
squared. 

199
00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:08.029
So, I can just rewrite in the usual 
physical units, I can write this 

200
00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:15.182
term as sine squared q times a. 
And now well again, this is just a 

201
00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:22.100
quadratic equation for Omega. 
So, if I solve it I will get two branches 

202
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:27.780
with a plus and minus sign. 
And well, I get there actually 

203
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.680
a rather non-linear and non-trivial relation 
between omega and q. 

204
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.145
There are two relations as a matter, two 
types of excitations, two types of 

205
00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:39.350
waves or normal modes
 that I get out of this 

206
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:44.306
solution. 
So, and if I plug in this dispersion

207
00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:51.520
relations, so this would be my Omega of 
q, and q here is defined. 

208
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:59.430
I should have mentioned it before between 
minus pi over a up to pi over a. 

209
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:06.248
So, we'll get two terms. 
There will be a branch corresponding to 

210
00:17:06.248 --> 00:17:09.483
plus sign, the plus branch which will look 
like this. 

211
00:17:09.483 --> 00:17:14.385
And there will be a branch corresponding 
to minus sign which will look 

212
00:17:14.385 --> 00:17:20.917
approximately as so. So, this is 
Omega minus and this is Omega plus.

213
00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:23.798
And the Omega minus is called Acoustic 

214
00:17:23.798 --> 00:17:30.170
Phonons, and the Omega plus is called 
Optical Phonons. 

215
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:37.785
So as you can see, there is a gap separating
 this optical phonons from zero energy. 

216
00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:38.921
So, if we hit our oscillator 

217
00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:46.696
chain with a hammer and it's going to be 
a non-linear perturbation. 

218
00:17:46.696 --> 00:17:49.368
We're going to excite all kinds of modes. 
But if we just touch it very slightly, 

219
00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:53.848
very gently and apply just a weak 
perturbation, there is no way we can 

220
00:17:53.848 --> 00:17:58.820
excite an optical phonon. 
We're only going to excite these energy 

221
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.870
excitations in the vicinity of zero 
energy. 

222
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:07.710
So, this is basically the energy 
associated energy that we would need to 

223
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.032
spend in order to excite in this case 
acoustic modes. 

224
00:18:11.032 --> 00:18:16.256
And the dispersion of the acoustic modes 
as q goes to zero, we'll also discuss it 

225
00:18:16.256 --> 00:18:22.087
in the next slide is a linear dispersion. 
And this type of linear dispersion is 

226
00:18:22.087 --> 00:18:28.235
called sound, sound-like dispersion. 
And the coefficient of proportionality, 

227
00:18:28.235 --> 00:18:32.424
basically Omega as a function of q, in 
the q to 0 limit, for this acoustic 

228
00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:36.805
phonons. 
And this coefficient of proportionality 

229
00:18:36.805 --> 00:18:39.989
is the speed of sound. 
I actually forgot to mention a couple of 

230
00:18:39.989 --> 00:18:42.958
things here. 
So in this equation, there appears this 

231
00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:46.197
variable mu. 
So, mu here is simply the reduced mass 

232
00:18:46.197 --> 00:18:50.240
which, we actually have seen before, quite a 
few times. 

233
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:57.965
Which is, in this case, the product of 
the mass of light atoms and heavy atoms 

234
00:18:57.965 --> 00:19:01.038
 divided by their sum. 
And the last thing I'm going to mention 

235
00:19:01.038 --> 00:19:06.040
on this slide is something about the 
optical phonons. 

236
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:10.330
Namely that the existence of this optical 
branch is related to the fact that we 

237
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:15.840
have two types of atoms 
present in our crystal. 

238
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:21.683
So, if we had just one type of atom, 
let's say these blue atoms were the only 

239
00:19:21.683 --> 00:19:23.603
type of atoms. 
Then, we would not have had the optical 

240
00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:28.440
branch and we only would've had the 
acoustic branch. 

241
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.960
Which by the way, the acoustic branch 
corresponds to what I was discussing in the 

242
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.370
end of the previous lecture to the 
presence of this sort of broken symmetry 

243
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:42.288
in the crystal. 
So finally, let me calculate the speed of 

244
00:19:42.288 --> 00:19:46.293
sound, that is the coefficient of 
proportionality in this dispersion of 

245
00:19:46.293 --> 00:19:55.056
the acoustic wave as q goes to zero. 
So as we can see here so if we just focus 

246
00:19:55.056 --> 00:20:07.008
on the minus sign in this equation, okay? 
So and if we consider the limit of q very 

247
00:20:07.008 --> 00:20:13.652
small, then this guy can be expanded in 
Taylor series just up to first order. 

248
00:20:13.652 --> 00:20:17.300
So, we're just going to have qa squared 
instead of the sine. 

249
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:21.986
And also well, this whole thing, the 
square root of 1 minus this 4 mu squared 

250
00:20:21.986 --> 00:20:30.048
over m M qa squared in the limit of small 
q. 

251
00:20:30.048 --> 00:20:35.022
It can be written again using the Taylor 
series if we have 1 minus epsilon. 

252
00:20:35.022 --> 00:20:39.048
And the epsilon is small, we can 
approximately write it as 1 minus epsilon 

253
00:20:39.048 --> 00:20:41.440
over 2. So, in this case,
 epsilon is this whole thing.

254
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.424
And this thing is small because we are 

255
00:20:42.424 --> 00:20:47.596
near the zero momentum and zero energy. 
So, we can write that approximately as

256
00:20:47.596 --> 00:20:57.556
1 minus 2 mu squared mM qa squared. 
So, if we plug it back in here, so we're 

257
00:20:57.556 --> 00:21:01.174
going to see that 1 minus 1 gives us 
zero, and we have just this guy in here.

258
00:21:01.174 --> 00:21:07.082
So, the spectrum of the acoustic phonons 

259
00:21:07.082 --> 00:21:22.804
in the q to zero limit is approximately 
equal to k over mu 2 mu squared and mM qa squared. 

260
00:21:22.804 --> 00:21:26.505
Or we can cancel these guys and we're 

261
00:21:26.505 --> 00:21:30.227
going to have simply recalling the 
definition of the reduced mass

262
00:21:30.227 --> 00:21:41.304
 two times the stiffness divided by the 
sum of two masses, times qa squared. 

263
00:21:41.304 --> 00:21:47.444
Or, if we take finally the square root of 
this expression, we're going to get Omega 

264
00:21:47.444 --> 00:21:53.849
minus, in the q to zero limit, is 
approximately equal to the square root of 

265
00:21:53.849 --> 00:22:03.270
2k a squared, m plus M times q. 
And this is our speed of sound. 

266
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.520
So in the next video, I'm going to redo 
the problem. 

267
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.845
Actually, in the quantum limit. 
And surprisingly, we're going to 

268
00:22:13.845 --> 00:22:18.170
see that the solution is not more 
complicated than in the classical limit. 

269
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.010
Well, I actually find the quantum 
solution actually easier than the 

270
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:26.452
classical solution. But in any 
case however you classify the 

271
00:22:26.452 --> 00:22:31.209
solution, easier or more complicated, the 
solution is actually going to be quite 

272
00:22:31.209 --> 00:22:38.233
similar to what we found here. 
And the spectrum of the quantum phonons 

273
00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:42.907
will turn out to be exactly equal to the 
spectrum of the classical formulas. 

274
00:22:42.907 --> 00:22:50.329
So which is another sort of striking 
manifestation of quantum to classical 

275
00:22:50.329 --> 00:22:52.070
correspondence, in actually a rather 
complicated system. 

276
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.200
In this case, this system models a 
crystal.
