1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,370
The quantum harmonic
oscillates the problem.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:08,410
And its solution go far beyond the simple

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,510
generalization of the particle and
is bringing problem on classical physics.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:19,010
And they appear in a variety of context
in quantum physics as already mentioned.

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,920
For example, electromagnetic radiation

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,590
can be thought of as a collection of
harmonic oscillators, the phonons.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,100
And much more generally,

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:33,830
various complex structures in quantum
mechanics oftentimes can be thought of

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:39,730
as being built of this small building
blocks being quantum harmonic oscillators.

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,590
But in each particular piece,

11
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,172
the meaning of this individual
oscillators is different.

12
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:48,730
And today I'm going to show you
the appearance of this quantum harmonic

13
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,240
oscillators in the context of
a very interesting problem.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,350
That is sort of underlies solid state
physics, or condensed metrophysics.

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,660
And this is a problem of
excitations in crystals,

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,250
which are collections of many,
many ions that form a periodic structure.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,770
And these ions can oscillate, and
these oscillations, quantum oscillations,

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,060
are called phonons.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,760
And we will see how these phonons appear.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,370
And we'll see also that they can be
described in terms of the creation and

21
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,540
oscillation operators that have been
introduced in the first lecture this week.

22
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,903
To understand the concept of a collective
mode such as a phonon for example.

23
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:38,011
In a complex quantum system, we first
can go back to classical physics and

24
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:42,148
remind ourselves the notion
of a normal mode which

25
00:01:42,148 --> 00:01:46,150
is equivalent to the quantum
collective mode.

26
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,770
And this normal modes appear
in complex classical systems.

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,630
So here I have a primitive
classical system.

28
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,200
If you want this is a simple
harmonic oscillator.

29
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,980
And in this case, as we know,
the frequency of the oscillation

30
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,480
is equal to the square root of
the stiffness of this spring

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,549
divided by the mass of this object.

32
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:16,060
Now if we made the system
a little more complicated,

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,510
and instead of just one oscillator,
consider,

34
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,860
let's say two masses attached to
let's say three springs in this case.

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,350
So we have a system here with
two degrees of freedom and

36
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,890
this system will have two
different oscillation frequencies.

37
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,810
Responding to different times
of oscillation motions.

38
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,260
So, for instance, this type of motion.

39
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,373
When the two masses sort of
oscillate in phase with one another.

40
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:53,649
So this let’s say first type
of motion is described by

41
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:57,183
the frequency which is exactly 2 to omega.

42
00:02:57,183 --> 00:03:01,467
There is also second type of motion that
we can imagine in this slightly more

43
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,768
complicated system.

44
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:04,990
In which case let’s say,

45
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,150
these guys oscillate out of phase,
in this fashion sort of.

46
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,650
And this oscillation frequency,
people two in this case,

47
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,500
is equal to square root of times
the basic frequency of these guys.

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,610
So let's assume they all
had the same stiffness.

49
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,030
And we can make things more and
more complicated, and

50
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,180
let's say in this case have a six.

51
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,710
This six masses a dash, at the springs,
and in which case we will have six

52
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:39,040
different degrees of freedom, and
six different oscillation frequencies.

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,390
And this oscillation frequency's so
called normal moles in classical physics,

54
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,870
they have an analog
[INAUDIBLE] in quantum physics.

55
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:53,090
In particular, let's say in this
example of two harmonic oscillators,

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,590
just by knowing the results
of the classical calculation.

57
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,370
We can write down, as a matter of fact,

58
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,590
the spectrum of the corresponding
quantum problem.

59
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,610
And the spectrum of the corresponding
quantum problem will be simply.

60
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,044
The energy's going to
be equal to h omega 1

61
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:21,401
(n1+1/2) + h omega 2 (2+1/1).

62
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:25,799
And it's going to depend on
two quantum numbers, n1 and

63
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:29,820
n2 corresponding to two
harmonic oscillators.

64
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,420
But these are going to be directly
the harmonic oscillators built out of

65
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,200
let's say the coordinates and
momentum of the two particles.

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,205
So these oscillators, so the corresponding
creation and operations, there's going to

67
00:04:44,205 --> 00:04:50,310
be a certain non-linear combination
of these x1's and P1's, x2, and P2.

68
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,310
Which sort of describe
the generalization of this in phase and

69
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,950
out of phase motions to quantum physics.

70
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,300
And in general, now we have a classical
system with some normal modes,

71
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,310
there's a corresponding quantum
system with the actual,

72
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,020
with the spectrum associated
with these normal modes.

73
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,500
A very interesting example of a complex
many particle quantum system is a crystal.

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,090
We know that crystalline
structures of various types

75
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,500
appear in a variety of
solid state materials.

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,460
And in this structure.

77
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:27,470
So what happens is that ions or atoms of
which this solid state material is sort of

78
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:33,970
built, they arrange themselves
into a unique order and pattern.

79
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,370
And so here, for instance,

80
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,050
I'm showing a fragment of
a so-called simple cubic lattice.

81
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,719
And these blue balls in this
picture respond to atoms sitting

82
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:50,953
on their equilibrium position
on their lattice sides.

83
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:55,352
But this picture is a bit deceptive,
actually it's probably better to

84
00:05:55,352 --> 00:06:00,240
say incorrect,
in that the atoms here in are not static.

85
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,650
So then indeed have some
preferential positions,

86
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,440
some equilibrium positions, but
they move around all the time.

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,920
So this position that they occupy
responds to a minimum in some effect,

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,490
the potential the fuel.

89
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,730
But they can oscillate near the minimal
of this potential, and these oscillations

90
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,830
are basically described locally as
essentially harmonic oscillator motion.

91
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,690
So a better illustration
of what a crystal is.

92
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,453
So that I put together, well, for
simplicity, for two dimensional case.

93
00:06:32,453 --> 00:06:33,850
So it is presented here.

94
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,604
So instead of thinking about atoms,
which are sort of tied together in this

95
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:41,630
crystalline structure
by some rigid objects.

96
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,880
We should think about
atoms being tied together

97
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,270
by some elastic springs with some
stiffness, which is fine, all right?

98
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,290
And so when we look at this system,

99
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,270
so by analogy to what I just
discussed in the previous slide.

100
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,180
We can think about this system
as a many-oscillator system

101
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,600
with a lot of degrees of freedom.

102
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,430
So in reality, in this material,

103
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:09,800
so there are not two or three or
six atoms like in the previous lab.

104
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,030
But there are billions and
billions of atoms.

105
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,610
And therefore, there are many frequencies,
eigenfrequencies and

106
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,580
normal MOOS, classical normal MOOS.

107
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:27,203
And they can respond to various kinds of
complicated oscillations in this system.

108
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:30,533
And in the limit of an infinite number,
basically so

109
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:35,693
called thermodynamic limit when we
consider essentially an infinite crystal.

110
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:40,769
So this creates normal MOOS
that merge into continuum

111
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:49,790
curves which essentially corresponded to
elastic waves running through this system.

112
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,310
And mathematically, these waves
are described by a familiar expression.

113
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,430
So if we think, let's say,
about the displacement of an atom

114
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,210
with regards to its equilibrium position,
some delta r.

115
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,780
As a function of time for
a particular atom, let's say nth atom.

116
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,680
So it's proportional to
the familiar exponential of chi.r,

117
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,010
so where this atom is located,
minus omega t.

118
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,650
But this omega is itself
a function of key.

119
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,290
And so to find this so called photon

120
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,320
dispersion is the main question that
appears in the context of this problem,

121
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,030
and this is what is going to
be of interest to us.

122
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,550
Of particular interest is the question of

123
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,440
what are the low energy
MOOS of this system.

124
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,930
So what it actually
means is the following.

125
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,950
Suppose we have a completely
static crystal.

126
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,430
So.
Well, as static as it gets.

127
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,260
In quantum mechanics,

128
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,780
there is always zero point motion but
we can consider a classical system.

129
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,750
Let's say we just physically built
this model by attaching a bunch

130
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,030
of masses to the springs and
arranging them.

131
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,610
In the equilibrium pattern, and let's
see with touch this system a little bit.

132
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,440
We apply very weak perturbation.

133
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,751
So, the question I'm asking
about the low energy modes is,

134
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:20,810
are we going to excite any
oscillation in this crystal, or

135
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,209
this weak perturbation is not
going to have any effect.

136
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,210
In other words, do we have to overcome
any threshold or gap as condensed metric

137
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:35,350
people call it, in order to excite
the minimal perturbation in the crystal.

138
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,670
And as we will see in a later,
in today's lecture, so

139
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,120
the answer will be that it doesn't
matter how weak the perturbation is.

140
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,640
There's always a very low energy mode,
which corresponds to a long wavelength or

141
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,960
a small k wave running through
the sample through this crystal.

142
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,380
And this type of an excitation
is called an acoustic mode or

143
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,779
it corresponds to sound modes
running through this crystal.

144
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,015
And it turns out that appearance
of this acoustic sound modes,

145
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:19,480
has a very profound explanation which
goes as far as relativistic quantum

146
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,330
physics actually where there is
a theorem called gold stone theorem,

147
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,100
which guarantees the appearance
of certain low energy moles.

148
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,400
And even though I'm talking
now about a classical system,

149
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,310
let me nevertheless try to
connect it to this therm.

150
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,860
But I will present sort of a poor's
man's version of this Goldstone

151
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,190
theory which is relevant to our problem.

152
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,560
And then hopefully we will be able to
understand how they are connected.

153
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,470
So this is going to be
a little bit of detail work.

154
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,630
So the poor man's version of the Goldstone
theorem that I'm presenting is related

155
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,900
to the notion of symmetry in quantum
physics that we already discussed.

156
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,260
So suppose we have a quantum
system which is invariant or

157
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,750
symmetric with respect to a certain
class of transformations.

158
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,850
What it means is that there exist
transformations, let me call them u, and

159
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,200
this operator commutes with the Hamil
20 which describes this system.

160
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,870
So this is what it means.

161
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,769
Or in other words,
UHU minus 1 is equal to H itself.

162
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,420
And let me consider the situation
when there is not just one or

163
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,510
two symmetry operations that exist,

164
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,590
but as a matter of fact we can have
a whole family of such operations.

165
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,570
Let's say labeled by some parameter,
let me call it alpha.

166
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,510
So an example of such symmetry for

167
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,920
instance could be symmetry
with respect to translation.

168
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:53,260
So let's see if our Hamiltonian is
symmetric with respect to translating

169
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,060
everything, every single particle in
space, let's say by a certain distance.

170
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:04,460
So it could be a distance of one meter,
or one centimeter, or one kilometer.

171
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,430
So there's a whole
continuum of distances and

172
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,430
directions in which we
can translate our system,

173
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,970
in which case this alpha actually is a
three dimensional vector of translations.

174
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,100
Well, another example could be
symmetry with respect to rotation.

175
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,710
In which case,

176
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,660
alpha could represent an angle that we can
choose by which we can rotate our system.

177
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,070
But in principle, can be anything.

178
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,400
So we just basically postulate
the existence of some symmetry,

179
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,900
what is called symmetry group, but
I'm not going to go into these details

180
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,060
with respect to which the felmonian
of the system is invariant.

181
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:42,430
But a very interesting fact
is that even though the model

182
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,350
itself can be invariant under
certain symmetry operations.

183
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,811
The quantum states, the, for instance,

184
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:54,908
lowest energy state of the ground
state does not necessarily,

185
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:59,253
have to be invariant,
under this same symmetry, U.

186
00:12:59,253 --> 00:13:04,713
So what it means is that the system,
we find itself in a state,

187
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:09,124
let's see, let me call it such that U,

188
00:13:09,124 --> 00:13:13,370
acting on this is not equal to.

189
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,550
So by translating, let's say,
our system in space,

190
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,370
we do not necessarily
represent the same state.

191
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:25,050
And in this case, we say that the symmetry
is broken, or spontaneously broken.

192
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,916
But the key statement, which is also
the statement of this Goldstone

193
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:33,943
theorem in this context is the following.

194
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:38,631
If once again we have a situation
where the Hamiltonian is a variant

195
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:42,398
under a certain continuum of symmetries,
but some or

196
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:45,340
all of these symmetries are broken.

197
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,750
In this state in which the system finds
itself in this state, let's say sine r.

198
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,890
Then to each broken continuum symmetry,

199
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,800
their response low energy mode,
sound like mode.

200
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,120
If you wanted, we just discuss.

201
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,620
And well, this statement,
this correspondence is again,

202
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,110
the statement of its goals down here.

203
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,590
So I realize that there have been
a lot of words that I've said,

204
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,190
but perhaps the best way to understand

205
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,300
the actual meaning of these words
would be to provide an example.

206
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,340
Which also will explain why this
discussion is relevant to what we

207
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,190
talked about before in the previous slides
about crystals, and all these things.

208
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,820
Now let us look at a crystal
structure once again.

209
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,020
So we have here a periodic
arrangement of atoms, but

210
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,720
nobody puts this crystal
structure by hand.

211
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,990
Right?
So if we have a piece of some sort

212
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,550
of material.

213
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,920
Let's say a piece of copper.

214
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,330
So nobody builds it by hand,
like atom by atom.

215
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,890
We don't have to do it.

216
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,810
So the nature does it itself.

217
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,130
So this structure, so
they form spontaneously.

218
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,983
And there is some wave
function if you want.

219
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:57,920
We described, well,
very complicated wave functions.

220
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,930
We described this atom.

221
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,048
So how do this atom
form in such a pattern?

222
00:15:04,048 --> 00:15:10,075
So I know it is a solution to a certain
Hamiltonian that describes those atoms,

223
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,093
and this Hamiltonian,
it has a kinetic energy of all

224
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:19,425
the particles involved in the problem,
all these atoms.

225
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:24,790
Plus, an energy describing
its interaction.

226
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,220
And very importantly here.

227
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:31,670
Well, it depends only on
the distance between the atoms.

228
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,370
So here n and
then they labelled various atoms.

229
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:38,885
Now if you look at this Hamiltonian, so

230
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:44,081
you see that if we translated
the whole thing, if we let's say,

231
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:48,911
change r to r plus some constant distance,
let me call it d.

232
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:52,343
Then the Hamiltonian is not going to
change since we have here only

233
00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:56,490
the distance between particles which
is the position of a nth particle minus

234
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,174
the position of nth particle,

235
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:01,720
if we translate both of
them by the same distance.

236
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,023
The distance between them is
not going to change right.

237
00:16:04,023 --> 00:16:08,727
So therefore, in other words,
what I'm saying here is that here

238
00:16:08,727 --> 00:16:13,443
the Hamiltonian is inverted under
a translations in real space.

239
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:16,755
But an arbitrary, it's very important,
but an arbitrary distance.

240
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:20,944
So, but if you look at
the crystalline arrangement here, so

241
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:24,015
it is no longer in variant
under an arbitrary translation.

242
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:29,592
So if I remove my particles, let's say
by a fraction of this lattice constant.

243
00:16:29,592 --> 00:16:30,832
Another reproduce the crystal.

244
00:16:30,832 --> 00:16:34,962
So the crystal is till symmetric but
it has a symmetry which is sort of lower.

245
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:36,462
It has only decreased symmetry.

246
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:39,932
While the original symmetry of
the problem was a continuum symmetry.

247
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,252
And that's the crucial difference.

248
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:46,240
And therefore here we have broken
spontaneously broken if you want.

249
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,008
Three continual symmetries in the x,
y and z directions.

250
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:56,020
And therefore there must exist three
modes or three fold generic mode or

251
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,600
at least three low energy
modes in this state.

252
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,390
And this modes are exactly
the performance that we're going to find.

253
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,940
Of course now our solution is,
we will see them automatically.

254
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,970
And they're not going to be related to
a spontaneous symmetry breaking itself,

255
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,100
but it's very interesting.

256
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,665
This connection is very
interesting because you can sort

257
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:22,867
of predict the existence
of such low energy modes.

258
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:29,400
Just by the fact that certain types of
structures form out of symmetric systems.

259
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,660
So in the rest of the lectures

260
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,670
today I'm not going to alluding
to this Goldstone theorem.

261
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,000
So this was just a remark for those
of you who are interested in advanced

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
understanding or advanced subjects.

263
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,300
But I just wanted to make
this remark because I find it

264
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,810
quite illuminating because
you can see the appearance of

265
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,700
the application of this very powerful
theorem in the very simple example.
