00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.596
So in this video, we're going to complete
the derivation of the spectrum or

2
00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:11.320
dispersion relation of quantum phonons and
well this part as well as the previous

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.539
part is a bit technical so I will actually
skip some of the calculations and

4
00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.588
we'll just show you the method,
illustrate the method which is called

5
00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:26.923
by the way Bogoliubov transformation
that is used to solve such a problem.

6
00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:31.049
And as a sad remark, let me mention here
that well, this material that I'm going to

7
00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:35.054
be covering is actually pretty advanced
graded material, so if you've got to

8
00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:39.290
this point, you should be proud of
yourself, this is very complicated.

9
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.580
Very advanced material of quantum
many body of physics here,

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.139
we're actually studying.

11
00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:49.730
So in this slide, I would like to review
the calculations we have done so far.

12
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.420
Tell you where we have been and
also where we're going with this.

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.680
And as we know, we started with
this classical oscillator chain.

14
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.990
Which is characterized by the coordinates
and momento of all the atoms in this one

15
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.020
dimensional crystal and the first
step in putting together the quantum

16
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.560
problem was to quantize this
which means basically to

17
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.350
replace the variables x and
p with the operators.

18
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.800
And so we just put hats on top of x,
p and h.

19
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.980
So the following step involved
expressing these momenta and

20
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.680
coordinates with
the corresponding creation and

21
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.010
annihilation operators which led to
this complicated looking Hamiltonian and

22
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.530
here this a n and a n dagger
correspond to creating an oscillation

23
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.000
In a particular side with
a particular atom labeled by m.

24
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.900
So the next step that we took in the
previous segment was essentially to forget

25
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.590
transform this creation and
annihilation operators and

26
00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.790
to express them in the q space In
the wave vectors space if you want.

27
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.850
And the corresponding
Hamiltonian is shown here.

28
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.877
So it has, as you can see,
two types of terms, a dagger and a.

29
00:02:10.877 --> 00:02:13.431
And this aq, a-q.

30
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:16.245
And so
now we have to work with this operators,

31
00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:20.660
this new creation and annihilation
operators, and this Hamiltonian.

32
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.220
And now I'm coming to where
we're going with this.

33
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.920
So if we did not have, let's imagine for
a second that we do not have this term.

34
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.915
Let's say we have just this term,

35
00:02:32.915 --> 00:02:37.305
so if this were the case, it would have
meant that we already solved the problem.

36
00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:41.555
The reason for
this being that this linear combination,

37
00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:48.105
the integral linear combination
of these independent a dagger as,

38
00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:52.895
they sort of correspond to a collection
of independent harmonic oscillators,

39
00:02:52.895 --> 00:02:55.650
the spectrum of which,
we know perfectly well.

40
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.820
So for each q, we have basically
a simple harmonic oscillator

41
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.370
such as in the previous lecture,
and we know its spectrum.

42
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.220
And now, we just collect these oscillators
and write them as an integral but

43
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.680
all in all, we know the result.

44
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.270
So this is essentially already a solution.

45
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.680
And therefore, this a of q or more
precisely actually the Hermitian conjugate

46
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.790
part here twice a of q, would have
been in the spectrum of our problem,

47
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.240
the spectrum of these quantum forms,
but of course we do have this term

48
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.780
we do have this term, and
we don't know what to do with it right.

49
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.639
So this in the spectrum of this
Hamiltonian is not at all obvious.

50
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.350
So a way to solve the problem
now is to actually to construct

51
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.780
a new set of creation and
annihilation operators.

52
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.040
So here I have an operator b,

53
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.180
which is an annihilation operator of new
type and there's also a b dagger of q.

54
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.810
And so let's assume that we
can transcribe this b and

55
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.650
b dagger as a linear combination of a and
a dagger.

56
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.460
In such a way that the new Hamiltonian
won't have the bad trumes.

57
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.950
By bad trumes, I mean the trumes that
we don't know how to deal with and

58
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.700
instead we'll have only this sort of
standard combination of b dagger and b for

59
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.080
which the spectrum is obvious and

60
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.730
so this essentially would
mean to solve the problem.

61
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.540
The ability to write the Hamiltonian
in this form, in the form of a linear

62
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.310
combination of some creation and
annihilation operator of this sort.

63
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.940
So would mean to solve the problem in this
lies that would give us the dispersion

64
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.760
relation of this best Which
actually are the quantum formulas.

65
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.389
Since we will see, so this b,
dagger hat, and b hat,

66
00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.940
they correspond to creation and
angulation operators of quantum phonons.

67
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.530
Essentially the normal modes, quantize
normal modes in this oscillator chain.

68
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.981
But together as well as you
can see is rather non-trivial.

69
00:04:57.981 --> 00:05:01.460
First we have to do this quantization and
then, well I wish it was simple.

70
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.069
But then,

71
00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.209
we have to do at least three linear
transformations to get to this point.

72
00:05:06.209 --> 00:05:08.726
And this last linear
transformation is what

73
00:05:08.726 --> 00:05:12.370
is actually known as
the Bogoliubov transformation.

74
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:19.390
So here's a picture of a younger Nicolai
Bogoliubov who was a very influential and

75
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.570
talented mathematical physicist,
a Russian mathematical physicist.

76
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.580
And he was an author of
many very important works.

77
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.750
And also, he came up with
a number of very important and

78
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.090
practical mathematical methods that
are used up to these days, and

79
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.050
one of these methods is this
Bogoliubov transformation that we're

80
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.750
going to be studying, and let me mention
that this Bogoliubov transformation

81
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.630
is still used very actively
in research papers.

82
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.980
I myself have used it in
a number of my published works.

83
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.040
And this is basically, in some sense,

84
00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.130
an every day tool of theorists
working in quantum physics and

85
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.360
in condensed matter physics as
well perhaps high energy physics.

86
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.280
So this is an important method.

87
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.210
But in the example that we're
going to be considering.

88
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.150
Today so
the method is rather straightforward and

89
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.830
we already advertised the motivation for
using this method.

90
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:28.810
So let's look again at this Hamiltonian
that we have for the original creation and

91
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.060
annihilation operators a sub q dagger and
a sub q.

92
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.900
So and again as I said,
so our strategy would be

93
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.180
to correct in some sense the definition
of the creation annihilation operators so

94
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.320
we can get rid of this unwanted term.

95
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.714
And if you look at this Hamiltonian,
you will see that this

96
00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:54.286
Hamiltonian involves essentially, so
if we didn't have this term again, so

97
00:06:54.286 --> 00:06:58.539
we would have had just a linear
combination of independent q operators.

98
00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:04.982
But this term, the appearance of this
term couples the q mode with -q mode.

99
00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:08.688
So whatever transformation
we come up with,

100
00:07:08.688 --> 00:07:14.643
it should probably involve a linear
combination of at least aq and a -q.

101
00:07:14.643 --> 00:07:16.708
So let me just present a forum,

102
00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:21.957
sort of knowing the result of course it's
easy, but it will save us some time.

103
00:07:21.957 --> 00:07:27.480
So let me just present a forum of
this generic Bogoliubov transform

104
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.480
that accomplishes what I want, namely that
introduces new operators in this case,

105
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.916
these are these operators b of q and
b daggers of q which

106
00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:43.747
are linear combination of a and
a dagger and vice versa a and

107
00:07:43.747 --> 00:07:49.007
a dagger are linear combinations
of both b and b dagger is here.

108
00:07:49.007 --> 00:07:51.473
And so here, I will assume and

109
00:07:51.473 --> 00:07:56.220
this assumption will be
verified sort of at the.

110
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.075
And let me assume that these coefficients
can be chosen to real numbers, well,

111
00:08:01.075 --> 00:08:02.677
functions better to say.

112
00:08:02.677 --> 00:08:05.897
And that they're even functions of q.

113
00:08:05.897 --> 00:08:09.017
So u of q is equal to u of -q.

114
00:08:09.017 --> 00:08:13.261
So in this case, actually this second
definition here is redundant because

115
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:17.950
the second definition of the equation
operator can be obtained from the.

116
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:25.030
Definition of an English operator simply
by applying the emission conjugation.

117
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.500
But in any case, so let us assume that
we can construct such an operator.

118
00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.710
So the first thing we need to do and this
is, basically I'm describing the strategy

119
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.615
of instructing buggaloo of transforms
Is to make sure that this v and

120
00:08:38.615 --> 00:08:41.790
v-hat are indeed creation and
annihilation operators.

121
00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.320
So I can call them such, but

122
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.680
actually this should have
a precise mathematical meaning.

123
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.190
And the precise meaning
would be that these guys.

124
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:56.395
So, say if I have b of some q and
b of p, let's say dagger,

125
00:08:56.395 --> 00:09:00.725
so this guys should be the commentator so
this guy should be zero.

126
00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:04.165
So if p is not equal to b then
it should be a delta function,

127
00:09:04.165 --> 00:09:07.795
otherwise anything otherwise is of no
sense so this is what I'm looking for.

128
00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:14.730
So my a and a dagger, so
the reason I call them creation and

129
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.030
undulation operators is that
they satisfy this relation.

130
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.660
Now the new operators occur actually
a linear combination of those two satisfy

131
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.460
the same computational relief.

132
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.580
So and this would involve a calculation
which would result in a constraint

133
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.340
on these coefficients u and v.

134
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.400
So if I calculate this computation
regulation that I already know, so

135
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.400
this is a commentator of a of q and
a daggers of p so

136
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.280
I simply plug in these
definitions to here and

137
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.080
this guy to here where they're
replacing q with p, and

138
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.160
I just calculate
the commutators term by term.

139
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.600
So what I can write, I can just write.

140
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.330
So I will have one, two, three,
four, four different terms.

141
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.670
So the first term, let's say will be
the commutator of these two guys.

142
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:11.640
So, such as here, and
using this constraint, I will require that

143
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.930
the commutator of these two guys would
be 2 pi delta function q minus p.

144
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.190
Now these two commutators
which result in this term

145
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.520
should give me 0 because these
both are annihilation operators so

146
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.710
likewise these two guys resulting
in this term should give

147
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:37.330
me 0 as well because these are commutators
of the creation operators, and

148
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.990
so finally I have a term which
couples b dagger of minus q and

149
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:47.040
b of minus p and
well since the commutator b b dagger is

150
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.130
equal to well this delta function,
The commentator would be dagger and

151
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.740
b is basically minus the commentator and b
dagger so it should give me this function.

152
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.420
And let me remind you that the delta
function involved here is actually

153
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:05.290
a living function so it doesn't really
matter that I have here minus signs,

154
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.510
et cetera.

155
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:10.690
So if I put everything together so this
guys' basically go away, right, so these

156
00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.840
guys go away and we have these two terms
that essentially all involve the same

157
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.560
Delta functions and also since there is
a delta function here, q is actually to p.

158
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.590
So the delta function is
0 if q is not equal to p.

159
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.900
And so, there are only terms,
therefore, I can simply write it as,

160
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.200
let's say, u sub q squared and
this guy will be v sub q squared.

161
00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.080
Now with a minus sign.

162
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.360
So if I put everything together from
this expression, so this is what I get.

163
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.690
And now I'll have to require that

164
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:46.650
the right hand side produces what is
supposed to be in the left hand side.

165
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:48.930
That it is this 2 pi delta function.

166
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:49.950
q minus p.

167
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.090
So which means that this
coefficient here so

168
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.580
this u squared minus 3 squared
must be identically equal to one.

169
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.060
And this introduces a constraint and

170
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.420
important constraint on this
Bogoliubov transformation.

171
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:06.480
So, basically what we're doing here,
again, so

172
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.980
let me sort of go back to
where we're going with this.

173
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.270
So, we want to put together
at this new operators.

174
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:19.910
And so we want to find explicitly
the expressions for this u sub q and

175
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.570
v sub q that first the wall would
ensure that this b and bw md,

176
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.230
the annihilation and
creation operators of something.

177
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:33.180
And second, another constraint
on these guys would be that

178
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.660
the resulting Hamiltonian now
expressed in terms of b and

179
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.480
d dagger could be simple enough so
that we know its solution.

180
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.660
And this is basically the essence
of Bogoliubov transformation.

181
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:47.420
So in this case, Because Bogoliubov
transformation is relatively simple and

182
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.910
actually most cases you will see
in the research literature it is

183
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.700
relatively simple but
in general it' may be more complicated.

184
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:59.850
It doesn't necessarily have to include
just two terms it may include more terms.

185
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:02.960
But in all these cases, so
the strategy would be same.

186
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.060
So, basically, to ensure that
the operators you introduce are indeed

187
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.190
creation operators and
second that they simplify our Hamiltonian.

188
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.200
So now, we can sort of keep this
constraint in mind or we can resolve it

189
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:23.770
once and for all by just using
new if you want of this u and v.

190
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.540
So in this can be achieved by using
the following mathematical identity.

191
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:34.740
So if we have, if we use the introduce u
of q being a cause of hyperbolic cosign.

192
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.070
So let me remind you that
the hyperbolic cosign of sum x

193
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:43.180
is equal to e to the power x
plus minus x divided by two.

194
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:47.820
And the hyperbolic sine of x
is equal to divided by two.

195
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:55.190
So this is a real version of the sine

196
00:13:57.025 --> 00:14:03.225
cosine in which case I would have
had the measure in constant i here.

197
00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:08.105
But in any case these guys satisfy
the following identity which is

198
00:14:08.105 --> 00:14:13.215
sort of an analog of the identity that
most of you know that sine squared

199
00:14:13.215 --> 00:14:17.360
plus cosine squared is equal to one so
here for the hyperbolic functions I have

200
00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.170
the hyperbolic cosines squared minus the
hyperbolic sine squared is equal to one.

201
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:25.070
And this is exactly the identity
that I want for my uvn, so.

202
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.570
And so if I use this preposition which
resolves as this identity once and for

203
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.840
all, so which basically it reduces the
problem with two parameters to a problem

204
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.170
with just single parametering,
in this case, is lambda.

205
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.440
So my sort of expression for
the creation and

206
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:46.830
annihilation operators and
it now becomes this, okay?

207
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:52.080
So I have a of q is equal to cosine
hyperbolic of lambda b q plus sign

208
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:58.770
hyperbolic of p of minus q dagger and
the corresponding a dagger All right.

209
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:04.260
So now what needs to be done is that we
have to just do a brute force analysis.

210
00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:11.650
We have just to go ahead and plug in
these expressions into the Hamiltonian.

211
00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:15.550
And I will leave it for
those of you are interested, for

212
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.370
those of you who for instance
are interested in becoming theorists, or

213
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.760
who are theorists or mathematicians,
or are just curious about the.

214
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.470
Technical parts so
you can go ahead and do the simple,

215
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.950
I don't want to call it simple it's a
straightforward exercise of just plugging

216
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.008
in let's say instead of this guy here
we're going to put this combination,

217
00:15:32.008 --> 00:15:37.280
instead of this guy we're going to put
this thing in combination et cetera and

218
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.239
so if you do so.

219
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:43.371
Well you will see some
unpleasant algebra but

220
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:46.127
this is an exercise I'm
sure you can do it.

221
00:15:46.127 --> 00:15:49.698
So here I'm showing the result of
the calculation if you do everything

222
00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.707
correctly this is what you should get.

223
00:15:51.707 --> 00:15:56.432
And the result here is a Hamiltonian
which now is expressed in terms of

224
00:15:56.432 --> 00:15:59.377
these new operators b of q and
b dagger of q.

225
00:15:59.377 --> 00:16:04.067
And as you can see it has the form which
is pretty much the same as we had before

226
00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:08.836
just with some nuclear coefficients which
we call now ie tilde and b tilde and

227
00:16:08.836 --> 00:16:13.756
here is the expressions for these
coefficients involving hyperbolic cosines

228
00:16:13.756 --> 00:16:16.512
of two and
hyperbolic sines of two lambda and

229
00:16:16.512 --> 00:16:20.949
these are the original coefficients
in the Hamiltonian for.

230
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:25.370
And so you may ask me,
what, why did we bother to

231
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.030
introduce new operations if we
got exactly the same thing.

232
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.420
So while the answer to this and

233
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.530
actually this brings me to the second step
in this Bogoliubov transformation is that.

234
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.840
Well, lambda here is a free parameters.

235
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.270
So measure to say, free function.

236
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:44.200
We can choose this function
any way we see fit.

237
00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.670
In particular, we can choose it
such that this unwanted term,

238
00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:51.130
the bad term that we don't want to see,
is identically equal to zero.

239
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:55.100
So essentially can set
by hand the b tilde of q

240
00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.810
equal to zero which leads
to an equation for lambda.

241
00:16:57.810 --> 00:16:59.760
So this equation, you can see from here,

242
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:03.380
if we just move this guy to the right
hand side and divide by cosine.

243
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:08.380
So sine hyperbolic or cosine
hyperbolic is tangent hyperbolic, so

244
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:13.440
the tangent hyperbolic of
2 lambda of q is equal

245
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.760
to minus b of q versus over a of q.

246
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.670
And so this essentially gives
us a specific result for

247
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.450
this lambda of q which
ensures that our Hamiltonian

248
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:32.110
in terms of this new creation and
looks simple.

249
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.470
So now let me clean it up a little bit and
sort of summarize things.

250
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:41.033
Again so this is the result that we got,
and also let me remind you that this a of

251
00:17:41.033 --> 00:17:44.099
q and d of q the original
coefficients we didn't know,

252
00:17:44.099 --> 00:17:47.455
and so we derived them in
the previous part of this lecture.

253
00:17:47.455 --> 00:17:51.763
And so let me remind you their explicit
form, so here is their explicit form so

254
00:17:51.763 --> 00:17:54.896
this is explicitly b of q, and
this is explicitly a of q.

255
00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:59.850
And well I wrote it sort of explicitly
this way but as you can see a lot of

256
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:04.719
things here cancel out including this
h omega there are a lot of other

257
00:18:04.719 --> 00:18:10.791
simplifications involved and if you
play around with this well with these.

258
00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:14.453
If you do a little bit of algebra,
you will see that,

259
00:18:14.453 --> 00:18:19.281
first of all lambda of q actually
determines as you can see from here,

260
00:18:19.281 --> 00:18:22.609
this guided zero as we wanted it to be,
but now,

261
00:18:22.609 --> 00:18:28.458
this guy is determined by lambda and we do
know lambda, so we simply plug it in here.

262
00:18:28.458 --> 00:18:31.280
And if you once everything is said and

263
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.105
done you actually have
an explicit expression for

264
00:18:35.105 --> 00:18:40.670
this a tilde of q which becomes in
the end of the day surprisingly simple.

265
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.220
So again this calculation is not obvious
from here it requires a little bit of work

266
00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:49.660
and due to the format of the lectures and
lack of time.

267
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.731
I'm not presenting it but those of you who
are interested of course can go ahead and

268
00:18:53.731 --> 00:18:55.626
check that this is indeed the result.

269
00:18:55.626 --> 00:19:01.659
So this is by construction but
a of q has this form, so if we plot it, so

270
00:19:01.659 --> 00:19:07.184
this a of q has this form which
is actually a very familiar form.

271
00:19:07.184 --> 00:19:12.209
This is A(q) which we have seen
before in the classical problem,

272
00:19:12.209 --> 00:19:14.820
in the context of acoustic forms.

273
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.160
And this is exactly what they are,
but now they are quantum form.

274
00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.820
So sort of to summarize the result and

275
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.360
also to emphasize a very important point,
so this is what actually got.

276
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.720
We have found explicitly a series
of linear transformations

277
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.570
of the regional Hamiltonian.

278
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.150
Or the regional operators
involved in the Hamiltonian.

279
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.770
Besides that,
the Hamiltonian can be cast in this form,

280
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.250
which is the so-called diagonal
form of the Hamiltonian.

281
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:45.380
Sometimes if you happen
to read research papers,

282
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.790
the research is all about
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian.

283
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:49.806
This is what it actually means.

284
00:19:49.806 --> 00:19:54.360
So to diagonalize the Hamiltonian
in a problem which

285
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.660
involves many quantum particles
essentially means the ability to write it

286
00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.730
as a linear combination of independent
oscillators of some other particles.

287
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.310
The sort of behavior of
which we know very well.

288
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.450
And so this is exactly what
we've accomplished here.

289
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.870
And so here we have also
this herition conjugate, so

290
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.140
if we calculate it it will be simply
the same theorem so we can write it

291
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:23.800
integral over q well twice a tilde of q.

292
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:32.600
b dot q bq well I should also mention one
thing that I sort of swept under the rug,

293
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.120
and this thing is that I
haven't paid attention to

294
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.780
constants that appear in the Hamiltonian
so there could be constant here.

295
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.070
If I had done it so
the correct result that I would

296
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:50.050
have found is well this is correct,
but there also is a constant true here

297
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:54.720
which corresponds to 0 point motion and
this 0 happens to be exactly one half.

298
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.850
So if you remember the solution to
the simple harmonic oscillator we have

299
00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:03.790
essentially h omega and plus one half and
so similarly it appears here.

300
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:10.260
So in this 2 a tilde of q is exactly
the energy moods of the oscillator.

301
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.660
So we can call it so
this guy is equal to h.

302
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.990
Omega of q and this would be
the spectrum of the quantum forms.

303
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.440
And this is presented here, so
the spectrum of the quantum form

304
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.420
here is twice omega here is the frequency
of a single oscillator in some sense

305
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.270
in the original classical picture it
would have been the frequency the natural

306
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.280
frequency of this spring connecting
the atoms in some sense.

307
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.350
And so the remarkable thing that I
want to emphasize in the very end, and

308
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.770
this will be the end of today's lecture,
is that it turns out that this spectrum of

309
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:47.160
quantum phonons is actually identical
to the spectrum of classical forms.

310
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.950
There is absolutely no
difference whatsoever.

311
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.960
So, if you go back to the problem
that we solved earlier today,

312
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.620
in today's lecture, so
namely the classical problem, so

313
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.760
it was a slightly more complicated in the
sense that it involved two types of atoms.

314
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.590
But if we had just one type of atom, so
this is the result we would have got.

315
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:11.250
The important conclusion of this
sort of discovery that quantum and

316
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.220
classical phonons turn out to be
exactly the same, is the following.

317
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.860
So we can say that we could have
quantized our problem at any stage.

318
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.810
So in the solution, I presented we did so
at the very beginning.

319
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:27.515
So we essentially converted
the original coordinates, and

320
00:22:27.515 --> 00:22:33.370
[INAUDIBLE] the atoms into quantum
operators, x hat sub n, and p hat sub n.

321
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.760
And then we went ahead with this
quantum calculation transform.

322
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.840
But instead of doing that there is
a second version of this solution one to

323
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.200
have solved the problem,
the classical problem first.

324
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.240
Which means finding the trajectories of
particles and the corresponding waves.

325
00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:56.790
And so one could have quantized
this normal move so basically, so

326
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:02.440
the normal modes can be converted then
into these essentially operators,

327
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.050
h omega q, some b [INAUDIBLE] q,
bq, plus one half.

328
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:09.430
So we could have done that.

329
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:14.140
And, the results, basically we have proven
that the results are exactly the same.

330
00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.820
And this is very important.

331
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.660
It shows us something about the quantum
to classical correspondence, and

332
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.660
this quantum to classical
correspondence sort of persists.

333
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.840
Also a more complicated problem, let's say
problems in three dimensions with more

334
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.400
degrees of freedom with
different types of atoms.

335
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.310
And this is true as long as we have

336
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.670
non directing theory which in the language
of these creation and annihilation

337
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.600
operators essentially means a theory
which is bilinear in this b and b dagger.

338
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.261
So as long as we have this bilinear forms,
we're fine with this quantum to

339
00:23:46.261 --> 00:23:51.640
classical correspondence but once we
have more complicated nonlinear terms.

340
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.780
So this situation becomes
much more complicated.

341
00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.650
So the last thing I'm going to mention is
that the appearance of such terms which

342
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.270
we're not going to discuss at all,
but, if we had these quadratic terms,

343
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.610
b dagger b dagger b b for

344
00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:08.320
instance, they would have meant that
the form would interact with one another.

345
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.410
So in some sense would have
corresponded to scattering

346
00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.570
of waves off each other,
waves running through the crystal.

347
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.160
And this is a very complicated
challenge to understand

348
00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.750
the behavior of such
an interacting system and

349
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:27.180
there are still ongoing theoretical
challenges in describing it.

350
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.310
So it's definitely beyond
the scope of this course.

351
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:35.060
But this theory is well understood and
I hope some of you got an idea

352
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.800
about phonons and collective modes
in classical and quantum physics.
