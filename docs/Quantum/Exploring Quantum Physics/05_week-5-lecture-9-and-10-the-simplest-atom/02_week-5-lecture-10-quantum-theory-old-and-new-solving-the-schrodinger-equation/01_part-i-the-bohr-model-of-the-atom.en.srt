00:00:01,587 --> 00:00:02,407
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,407 --> 00:00:04,867
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:10,140
We're now going to proceed on the work
done in the previous lecture and

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,028
start applying it to
problems of atomic structure

5
00:00:14,028 --> 00:00:18,579
using the old quantum theory and
then work on towards new.

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,458
Once again, let me remind you
of the relevance of Bohr's

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:30,195
original paper to the discussion
that we're having today.

8
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:39,135
So to remind you where we left off
at the end of the last lecture.

9
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:45,709
We solved the problem for
the motion of the hydrogen-like systems,

10
00:00:45,709 --> 00:00:51,720
one electron,
one nucleus in classical mechanics.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,287
We found a sort of generic,
fairly simple solution.

12
00:00:56,287 --> 00:01:03,030
It allows for
any real value of the total energy.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,780
When that energy is negative,
the orbits, they're not only bounded,

14
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:15,980
but they close on themselves,
a very non-generic fact in dynamics.

15
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,846
And when the energy is positive,

16
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:23,857
then they travel off to infinity.

17
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:29,370
Now I strongly encourage
reading this paper,

18
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,270
which is contained in
the additional materials.

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,790
I mean, not from start to end, but

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,300
just to get a sense of the great
thing that it accomplished.

21
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,980
And you have to go rather
far down into the paper, and

22
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,760
this is one of the homework problems,
is to go find and analyze the language

23
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,040
that is used in this section.

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,175
And we give some hints as to what page to
look at in the guidance to the homework.

25
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:05,805
And the really fantastic thing that

26
00:02:05,805 --> 00:02:10,690
Bohr did that still survives.

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:19,217
His foundational idea is that it's
the quantization of angular momentum.

28
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:24,108
So he found the series of
circular orbits that he

29
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:28,155
thought should be stationary states.

30
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:35,177
And he actually sort of mentions
this almost as an after thought,

31
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:40,668
that the selection criteria
that he used amounts to

32
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:46,159
requiring that the angular
momentum is an integral

33
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,640
value of the reduced blast cause in h bar.

34
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,637
So you see, when you do that,
you get an instant

35
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:04,627
solution for the discrete energy levels.

36
00:03:04,627 --> 00:03:09,546
So you require that the angular
momentum be an intern multiple of

37
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:12,287
h bar running from one to infinity.

38
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:16,317
Now actually, in modern quantum mechanics
the value of zero is allowed as well so

39
00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:18,300
let's be very clear about that.

40
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,267
But in any event, here is
an expression for the energy levels,

41
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:30,534
which I've casted here
in sort of modern form.

42
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:33,934
Alpha's the so-called
fine-structure constant.

43
00:03:33,934 --> 00:03:39,757
Again, the definition depends upon
the choice of electrical units.

44
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:49,246
You might see a four pi epsilon naught
in the denominator depending on

45
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:50,710
the choice of units.

46
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,500
But in any event,

47
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,060
the fine structure constant is a pure
number, it's approximately equal to that.

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,415
And so if you want a mnemonic for

49
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:04,447
remembering what the Bohr
energy levels are,

50
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:08,974
it's kind of like e is
equal to mc squared.

51
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:13,316
So all the dimensionality of energy
that appears in this expression is

52
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:18,037
due to the rest mass energy of
the electron, Einstein's rest mass energy.

53
00:04:18,037 --> 00:04:22,983
And then the coupling constant,
this is a pure number,

54
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:26,050
z alpha squared over 2n squared.

55
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,274
I'm going to phrase that in a slightly
different way in the inline quiz,

56
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:33,791
have a look and see if you come
up with the same conclusion.

57
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:43,937
So the Bohr energy equation gives rise to
a very important fundamental constant.

58
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:50,163
One of the most accurately measured,
the so called Rydberg constant,

59
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:54,637
which takes this value in
units of inverse meters.

60
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:59,414
And so the energy levels
of the hydrogen atom can be

61
00:04:59,414 --> 00:05:04,197
conveniently expressed
in complete dimensional

62
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:09,316
form in terms of the product,
the Rydberg constant,

63
00:05:09,316 --> 00:05:14,120
and Planck's constant,
and the speed of light.

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,720
And this number R infinity hc

65
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,870
is approximately equal to this
number in electron volts.

66
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:29,960
That's the energy change that
you get by moving an electron

67
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,390
through a potential difference of 13.6
volts, about the voltage of a car battery.

68
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,490
Now another thing that falls out very
nicely from the Bohr theory, and

69
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,170
at least this type of scaling is
retained in modern quantum mechanics,

70
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,270
is the relationship between
the radius of the orbit and

71
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,162
the so-called principle quantum number.

72
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,454
So the radius goes as a square,
the principal quantum number, and

73
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:07,423
the coefficient of proportionality's
the length, the Bohr radius,

74
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:09,187
which takes this value.

75
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:22,127
I guess you'd say that's 53
picometers approximately.

76
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:30,899
Now there's another important relation,

77
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,955
which I'll just let you
discover in the inline quiz.

78
00:06:35,955 --> 00:06:42,856
So the varial relationship that you got
through working through the inline quiz,

79
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:48,658
yet again, the constants of
proportionality that connect the total

80
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:55,677
energy with the expectation value of the
kinetic energy and the potential energy.

81
00:06:55,677 --> 00:07:00,297
Those are preserved in
modern quantum mechanics.

82
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:06,850
Now, well,
we said Bohr had a great breakthrough.

83
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,297
What's the basis for that judgement?

84
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:14,077
One was just these spectacular
agreement with experiment.

85
00:07:14,077 --> 00:07:21,634
So again, the frequency of the spectral
line, the inverse of the wavelength and

86
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:26,207
spectral line is given
by an energy difference.

87
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:31,127
And so it was possible to
compute all the possible

88
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:36,417
energy differences according
to the Bohr formula.

89
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:42,031
And, this as we shall see,
gave an account of all the known

90
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:47,772
lines of hydrogen,
solved some other problems and predict
