00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.410
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.030
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.840
And, we're now going to start
talking about how to solve

5
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.640
the Schrodinger Equation, what the means,
how it's done in practice.

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.900
And, we're going to start with some simple
constructive techniques to give you a few

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:27.850
tools that you can use If you are stuck
in solving a quantum mechanics problem.

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.040
Sometimes a few of these simple tricks
will help you see your way through,

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.290
help you identify appropriate
scaling relations and the like.

10
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.180
So let's proceed.

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.610
Okay, here's the Schrödinger equation,

12
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.840
which you've heard a lot
about already in the course.

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.020
Psi is a wave function,
H the Hamiltonian operator.

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.760
i h bar d psi dt is H psi.

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.200
And, the precept of quantum
mechanics is that all

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.317
accessible information about the state
is contained in the wave function.

17
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.810
Now this is for an isolated system.

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.010
When we're talking about two interacting
systems, or of a system in a bath and

19
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.920
there's a lot more nuance.

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.950
But, let's just stick with simple many
body systems in the absence of noise or

21
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.240
thermal bath, because that in itself
is an interesting enough problem.

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.030
So, in other words,
If we know the wave function at a given

23
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.570
time we can just
sequentially integrate this

24
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.860
equation using some technique
to find it at a later time.

25
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.560
So, why in this era of high performance
computing and all these other

26
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.370
wonderful things, is anyone really worried
about solving the Schroedinger equation?

27
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.800
The inline quiz contains sort of
an exercise on thinking about how

28
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.219
you use the Schrodinger equation to
propagate the wave function forward.

29
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.780
So, from a formal and even a practical
perspective for various simple systems,

30
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.220
solutions to shorter equation
are fairly straight forward to find.

31
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.410
But, in real life we're encountered with

32
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.680
problems that involve atom
psycho ytterbium 70 electrons.

33
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.740
There's a system I happened to have worked
on myself with wonderful collaborators,

34
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.690
Marianna Safronova, Sergei Porsev,
during the past year.

35
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.680
And, it's motivated by
determining the corrections to

36
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.014
atomic transition frequency due to
the presence of a thermal background for

37
00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:56.150
the application to next
generation atomic clocks.

38
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.960
Well, a very simple, very simple
consideration will show you that even

39
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.970
a crude representation of
the 70 electron wave function

40
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.765
on a course grid would just be
completely infeasible by today's

41
00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:17.750
,and presumably just about any future,
technology we know of.

42
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.020
So, physics oriented approaches that
take advantage of approximations,

43
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.590
reasonable approximations,
I think are always going to be essential.

44
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.100
And so, learning how to solve the simple
systems gives one good guidance

45
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.266
as to what you going to have to do
to deal with more complicated ones.

46
00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:50.673
Now, there are many cases in which one
needs to solve the full time dependent

47
00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:55.090
Schrödinger equation is studying
non-equilibrium quantum systems.

48
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.440
Here is an example of an equation of,
solution of a, actually it's a non linear

49
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.020
shortage equation,
that describes a Bose-Einstein Condensate.

50
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.868
This is, these is, this is a spatial
representation of density of

51
00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:12.790
an atomic cloud at various times.

52
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.269
And so, it's sometimes critical
to have information like this.

53
00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:25.408
However, there's quite enough to
be learned by understanding how to

54
00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:28.498
solve the stationary states of the system,

55
00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:34.090
which underpin a lot of the important
phenomena that we see in nature.

56
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.580
And so, for the rest of this lecture
is going to focus on the solution for

57
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.660
stationary state problems.

58
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.060
So, here is the time independent
version of the Schrodinger equation.

59
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.317
The Hamiltonian operating on size and
eigenvalue,

60
00:04:52.317 --> 00:04:57.457
eigenfunction of an Hamiltonian
operator with eigenvalue E.

61
00:04:57.457 --> 00:04:59.669
What does is mean it mean
to solve this equation?

62
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.060
Well, the real life problem
that faces research physicists

63
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.750
is they have some material system
with an atomic molecular composition.

64
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.750
So, they have a good idea
of the Hamiltonian, but

65
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.360
then they have particles moving
subject to that in that Hamiltonian.

66
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.265
And, they need to find,
they need to find the eigenfunctions.

67
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.770
Well, in other words,
usually we know the form of interactions,

68
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.560
between the particles.

69
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.310
And, we want to find the energy, and

70
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.179
the wave function describes
the stationary state.

71
00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:48.722
We're going to get to that, but
at first we're going to take

72
00:05:48.722 --> 00:05:53.521
a slightly different approach
than is conventional,

73
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:57.901
and that is look at some
well known function psi and

74
00:05:57.901 --> 00:06:02.600
see which Schrodinger
equations they satisfy.

75
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.200
Because if you have some experience doing
that, then you can often make your way

76
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.910
forward much more rapidly in
solving a practical problem.

77
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.990
This constructive approach,
that we're discussing now,

78
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:19.725
is actually extremely simple.

79
00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:20.840
Here's, for example,

80
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.460
let's take a motion of a particle mass and
a potential in three dimensions.

81
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.387
Here's the Schrodinger equation for
that and

82
00:06:31.387 --> 00:06:39.270
by the trivial mathematical transformation
you can reduce it to this form.

83
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:46.400
So, in another words,
If you know how to differentiate psi,

84
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.920
you can find an energy and
a potential for which it is a solution.

85
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.010
So, there's nothing better then
solving a Schrodinger equation.

86
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.070
Let's do it in the next in line example.

87
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.288
So, I hope you've found that was
a fairly easy problem to solve.

88
00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:10.930
It just involves taking a derivative, and

89
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.570
now I might say that the solution
is not entirely a contrived one.

90
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.030
It's one that does occur in
the theory of particle scattering.

91
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:25.320
It's the basis for an important limit in
the description of atomic collisions.

92
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.240
Okay, so now,
back to this somewhat trivial procedure.

93
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:39.718
You put in any function and
it will solve a Schroedinger Equation.

94
00:07:39.718 --> 00:07:44.450
But, usually not an interesting one.

95
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.012
But, it's worthwhile looking at the cases
where the interesting solutions

96
00:07:48.012 --> 00:07:50.497
are obtained.

97
00:07:50.497 --> 00:07:54.117
Furthermore, there

98
00:07:54.117 --> 00:07:58.980
are constraints on what are allowable
solutions to the Schrödinger equation.

99
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:06.201
For example, In three dimension
D cubed R psi star psi has

100
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:11.788
got to be equal to one for
stationary state.

101
00:08:11.788 --> 00:08:16.840
The probability of the net probability

102
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.590
of a particle being in the presence
of a potential must always be unity.

103
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.780
And so, there are lots of
choices of wave function here

104
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:31.090
which cannot possibly be
brought into this form.

105
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.430
But, let's go find some useful ones.

106
00:08:35.105 --> 00:08:40.176
Okay, so
the last in line quiz simply has you take

107
00:08:40.176 --> 00:08:47.227
one of the most useful font skins,
not just in quantum mechanics but

108
00:08:47.227 --> 00:08:53.661
in practical mathematical
analysis of just about anything,

109
00:08:53.661 --> 00:09:00.609
and find out what sort of Schrodinger
equation it is a solution of.

110
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.570
And, that'll be it for this lecture.

111
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.852
Then we'll go and apply that function,
in the following lectures.
