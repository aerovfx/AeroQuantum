00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.720
Hello everyone,
welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.400
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.510
Now we're going to start to use some
of the tools we've developed and

4
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.840
get a glimpse of how they're applied
in larger scalable calculations.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.735
In particular, those that use some
form of the variation principle.

6
00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:28.030
Now, in

7
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.310
the quiz at the end of the last lecture,
we looked at this function.

8
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.751
It's a generalized Gaussian,

9
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:44.930
exponential of quadratic form, and

10
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.080
you have seen the one dimensional
version of this previously.

11
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.210
This is the notation that I prefer
because I can remember it, and

12
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.090
I write it out here because it
illustrates an important thing and

13
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:10.630
that is in the Gaussian
there's a scale parameter,

14
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.540
which is a length scale parameter d.

15
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.733
And that means for
in the regions where x is much

16
00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:24.538
greater than d, psi goes rapidly to zero.

17
00:01:24.538 --> 00:01:31.194
So this d describes a localization domain
of the wave function and also leads

18
00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:38.260
to an important observation on the
dimensional units of the wave function.

19
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.588
Which I offer you to
consider in the online quiz.

20
00:01:42.588 --> 00:01:47.948
So the dimensional units
of the one-dimensional wave

21
00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:53.316
function psi of x it's 1/the
square root of length.

22
00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:57.680
I mean, I find a common misconception
among beginning students of quantum

23
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.322
physics that the wave functions are all
dimension less, well they are not, and

24
00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:06.930
in fact that has very important
consequences for making estimates.

25
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.100
The wave function is a proxy for the
probability density which has the units of

26
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.940
inverse volume, so be aware.

27
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.661
And there's a problem
in the homework that,

28
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.650
where this aspect comes up.

29
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.130
Now I put a lot of emphasis
on the use of Gaussians

30
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.390
just because there are ways
of remembering what to do

31
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.290
that are very conveniently exercised
by use of Gaussian trial functions.

32
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:49.240
But secondly, they are a tremendously
powerful influence in theoretical

33
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.130
chemistry, that is the calculation
of molecular structure.

34
00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.120
And this man John Pople is a person who's
awarded with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

35
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.670
Primarily for
developing Gaussian based techniques of

36
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.440
the calculation of structure
of complex molecules.

37
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.880
And just as an example of how
influential this approach has been,

38
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.000
here are some citations of

39
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.870
articles that deal just
simply with the properties

40
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.660
of Gaussian basis sets, so
over 14,000 citations of this article.

41
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.360
And you can compare that to what at least

42
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.990
as of a year ago was the most sighted
paper in physics, probably still is.

43
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.340
The paper that articulated
the standard molecule,

44
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.210
there's just probably there
are many more chemists

45
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:57.340
using these type of approaches in a large
scale way then there are physicists.

46
00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:04.520
Now why are these trial functions so
powerful?

47
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.630
The answer is the Variational Theorem,
which we're going to prove briefly.

48
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.840
So I'll state it this way.

49
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.520
And this is not a rigorous math statement,
it's kind of like a physics statement.

50
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.720
So if we take any Hamiltonian,

51
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.930
that means any Hamiltonian
with reasonable properties.

52
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.620
And any normalizable Eigen
function satisfies that condition.

53
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.790
Then this the expectation
value of the Hamiltonian,

54
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.070
over that wave function is greater than or

55
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.670
equal to the ground state
energy of the system.

56
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.460
And so
that means if you just have a big gun and

57
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.300
lots of bullets and some intelligence,

58
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.130
you just take a large set of functions
that you can systematically expand

59
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.530
and start varying into
a random walk through

60
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.430
function space to try to lower
the energy of the system.

61
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.360
And with luck, you will approach
the ground state energy that you see.

62
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.980
The ground state energies
are important particularly in

63
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.100
things like molecular structure,
in the sense that

64
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.480
the ground state energy of the lowest
energy electronic wave function.

65
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:37.180
If you consider the dependence of the
total energy of the system on the nuclear

66
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.280
coordinates, it's usually effective
to find that by minimizing

67
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.730
the electronic energy subject to
variations of the trial functions.

68
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.980
Okay, let's see how
that works in practice.

69
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.310
Well no, let's see how that works in, so

70
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.630
here's an outline of the proof
of the variational theorem.

71
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.910
I just theorized it, just restated
it here from the previous line.

72
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.980
Now, you might want to, I'm going to
go quickly from one step to the next.

73
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.530
But you might want to
pause the lecture and

74
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.180
make sure that you understand
the procedure because this is actually

75
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.784
emblematic of a lot of arguments
made in quantum mechanics.

76
00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:31.953
So, Any,

77
00:06:31.953 --> 00:06:35.020
see, I should have written
this as a psi like that.

78
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.120
Let us say that we know, in principle,

79
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.380
all the eigen functions of a Hamiltonian.

80
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.977
So, h hat phi and

81
00:06:54.977 --> 00:06:59.580
equals en phi n.

82
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.040
No there exist some Heigan functions
even if we don't know them.

83
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.640
They form a complete set so
whatever the trial wave function is,

84
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.080
it can be expanded in the basis of
Heigan functions, that satisfy this.

85
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.944
Well then, what's the expectation
value of psi, well we

86
00:07:22.944 --> 00:07:29.626
can just compute it straightforwardly
within this representation here.

87
00:07:29.626 --> 00:07:34.400
So we just plug that part in.

88
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.960
Well let's see.

89
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.190
This part here is identically
equal to that, and

90
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.450
then this one is it's Hermitian transpose.

91
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.730
So this is just a straight
forward representation of how we

92
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:50.609
calculate the expectation
value of a Hamiltonian.

93
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:57.075
And so now, by construction Phi (m) H

94
00:07:57.075 --> 00:08:02.005
(hat) phi (n) equals delta (n,m)

95
00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:06.935
because they're Heigen functions, so

96
00:08:06.935 --> 00:08:14.916
that just collapses this
two-dimensional structure into one.

97
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:19.734
And now this sum must be greater than or

98
00:08:19.734 --> 00:08:23.348
equal to the same sum where,

99
00:08:23.348 --> 00:08:29.071
instead of taking
the state by state energy,

100
00:08:29.071 --> 00:08:34.945
we take the common,
the ground state energy,

101
00:08:34.945 --> 00:08:41.490
E naught, and
then this sum is just E naught.

102
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:46.060
So, in other words, this

103
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.360
term, this is proven that the average

104
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.540
expectation value of the Hamiltonian is
greater than the ground state energy.

105
00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.128
And in fact,
the equality sign means that if

106
00:09:00.128 --> 00:09:09.093
psi h psi equals E not.

107
00:09:09.093 --> 00:09:14.379
Then H psi =

108
00:09:14.379 --> 00:09:19.150
E not psi.

109
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.190
So it happens to be if
you get an equality,

110
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.010
you have found a ground
state Heigen function.

111
00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:33.440
Now, as to why this is important in
practice and in chemistry in particular,

112
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:39.130
I don't think we're going to cover this
topic in any detail on this course,

113
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.770
but if you Google or go to Wikipedia and

114
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:47.380
look at
the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation.

115
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:57.560
You'll see there's this general argument,
electrons move much faster than nuclei.

116
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.790
And so, in a complex material system,

117
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:04.698
the nuclei are moving slowly, and
the electrons are able to adjust,

118
00:10:04.698 --> 00:10:10.490
essentially instantaneously
to most of the nuclei.

119
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.180
So electrons are sort of the glue
that holds materials together.

120
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:21.090
So if you can minimize the total
energy of the system for

121
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:28.230
fixed internuclear coordinates as
a function of the electron wave functions,

122
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:34.450
then you typically get a very good
representation of the material structure.

123
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:39.830
And this task was made conceptually

124
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:47.030
practically much easier by Walter Kohn and
his collaborators,

125
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.880
who got the Noble Prize in chemistry for
the development density-functional theory.

126
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.710
Which is now sort of one of
the practical theoretical underpinnings

127
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.130
upon which a Gaussian trial
approximation is used.

128
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:11.640
So, just to summarize, these things are
very useful for a lot of applications, and

129
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.730
you're going to make an application of
it in one of the homework problems.
