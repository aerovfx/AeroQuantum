00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:04,181
Hello, everyone.
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:05,689
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,896
Now we're going to look briefly at some of
the many applications of the Bohr model.

4
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:18,708
I'll remind you again that
it can be found, sorry,

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:24,382
a copy of Bohr's paper can be
found in the original scientific

6
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:29,399
literature, and
you probably will need to look at that

7
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,000
in order to successfully
complete the homework.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,091
Plus, and
I'll try not to keep saying this over and

9
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:42,565
over again,
if you read some of Bohr's original work,

10
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:48,200
then you'll be a step above most
physicists, who have never done so.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,402
They've only read of his work by
people who have interpreted it,

12
00:00:54,402 --> 00:01:01,300
so it's a chance to do something
original and creative, in my opinion.

13
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:11,989
Okay, so here's Bohr's energy
expression once again,

14
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:19,585
so reminding you R infinity has
the dimensions of inverse length,

15
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:25,030
H bar c is energy times length,
n is an integer.

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,274
And so
the basic idea that Bohr had was that

17
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:34,246
these define a system of
stationary states, but

18
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:38,733
those stationary states
can be disturbed by

19
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:44,687
the electromagnetic field
which can cause transitions.

20
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:51,742
So absorption of a quantum of light
can either increase the energy,

21
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:56,956
raise the electron from
a lower to a higher orbit.

22
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:04,940
Or emission of a photon can cause an
excited state to fall to the ground state.

23
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,106
And this idea is still an essential
part of quantum theory.

24
00:02:10,106 --> 00:02:16,228
The main point is there is
fundamentally a lowest state.

25
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:21,808
So in the fullness of time
things will radiate down there.

26
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:28,575
So these are the expressions
that one gets for

27
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:32,502
the inverse wavelength.

28
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:38,409
This is why the Rydberg
constant is expressed

29
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,699
in this strange unit of inverse meters.

30
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:48,776
It's in some sense a historical
artifact that the wavelength of light

31
00:02:48,776 --> 00:02:55,530
is something that was very easy to measure
by diffraction interference experiments.

32
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,740
Frequency, on the other hand,
is hard to measure directly, even today.

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,620
So the inverse wavelengths of the light
are given by this simple formula.

34
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,087
So for the infinite nuclear mass it's
just a Rydberg constant divided by these

35
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:12,771
integers.

36
00:03:12,771 --> 00:03:17,625
For finite mass,
which is something we're going to talk

37
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,268
about momentarily,
there is a factor of the value of

38
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:27,031
the reduced mass divided by
the mass of the electron.

39
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,143
So these famous lines seen both
in emission and absorption,

40
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:40,070
the Balmer series, the visible part
of the spectrum of atomic hydrogen,

41
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,622
were all explained by the Bohr model.

42
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:49,619
Furthermore, There

43
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:55,383
were other lines that were known
at the time in the infrared,

44
00:03:55,383 --> 00:04:00,582
the so-called Paschen series,
and Bohr also applied

45
00:04:00,582 --> 00:04:06,685
to his model to helium-plus,
where you change the value of z and

46
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:13,377
now you get predictions of where
the lines of helium-plus should be.

47
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:18,117
And so in the paper that we have
available in the additional materials,

48
00:04:18,117 --> 00:04:23,015
he shows that he can explain all the known
lines of hydrogen, and then also

49
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:28,563
explained the so-called Pickering series
lines as being lines of helium-plus.

50
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:31,535
There was some uncertainty
at the time as to whether,

51
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:34,056
many people thought they were for
hydrogen.

52
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:40,996
Then immediately following Bohr's work,
within early the next year,

53
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:46,571
Lyman, a famous spectroscopist
at Harvard University,

54
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:51,820
looked in the far ultraviolet
region of the spectrum.

55
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,175
It's a very difficult technological
region that hadn't really been explored

56
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:56,958
previously.

57
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:01,387
And he found lines with n1 = 1,

58
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:05,827
that's the lowest value of n1.

59
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:10,264
n1 must be greater than or
equal to 1 in Bohr's theory.

60
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:14,269
So he found another series.

61
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:18,252
1922, the series with n1 = 2,

62
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:22,491
n1 = 3 were accounted for at the time.

63
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:25,544
n1 = 4 was discovered 1922.

64
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:28,800
Shortly thereafter when the n1 = 5,
and so on.

65
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,298
They just keep going and going and going.

66
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:34,961
At some point they stop naming,
actually not a some point, at n = 6,

67
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:38,915
they stopped naming these
series after their discoverer,

68
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:44,073
because it became appreciated there's
an infinite number of these series.

69
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:52,439
Indeed, here's a fairly
recent paper that shows just

70
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:58,500
how striking this phenomenon
of the Bohr-like series is.

71
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,522
These are absorption lines seen, so

72
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:10,812
there's an interstellar
cloud that is between us and

73
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:16,000
the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A.

74
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,977
And this is a spectrum, I don't know
if you can read it that clearly here,

75
00:06:21,977 --> 00:06:23,790
in the radio frequency region.

76
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:30,320
These are numbers like 25 MHz.

77
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,970
And you see this regular
series of absorption lines,

78
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:42,418
all very sharp, and
they satisfy the Bohr formula but

79
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,260
now the values of n are not
of the order of 1, but

80
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,431
range up to about 1,000.

81
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:54,511
Now if you recall,
the radius in the Bohr model

82
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:59,323
goes as the square of
the principal quantum number, so

83
00:06:59,323 --> 00:07:04,985
these are atoms that are 1 million
times larger than hydrogen.

84
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:09,220
They're the size of a bacteria.

85
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,054
And so this relationship,

86
00:07:14,054 --> 00:07:19,283
the Bohr frequency of from
what you've seen now,

87
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:25,560
it's observed to hold over
eight decades of frequency.

88
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,975
This is sort of
the the Lyman-alpha region,

89
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:36,829
optical frequencies down
into the radio waves.

90
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:40,938
So it's a great unifying concept, and

91
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:45,917
even though, as we'll see or
as you must know,

92
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:52,529
Bohr described things purely in
terms of the classical orbit.

93
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,985
He didn't have the essence of
quantum mechanics in terms of

94
00:07:56,985 --> 00:08:01,989
the superposition principle and
the existence of wave function.

95
00:08:01,989 --> 00:08:08,652
Nevertheless, it's extremely valuable
mnemonic and organizing concept.

96
00:08:08,652 --> 00:08:14,161
Now I want to mention another
aspect of the Bohr model which

97
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:20,461
is very important in a fundamental
discovery in nuclear physics,

98
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:25,087
the discovery of the heavy
isotope of hydrogen.

99
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,913
So as of this year, 1931,

100
00:08:28,913 --> 00:08:33,919
which was 20 years after the Bohr model

101
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,780
approximately had been articulated,

102
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:45,719
atoms were thought to be made
of protons and electrons.

103
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:51,402
The neutron was not known, but
there was this curious phenomenon

104
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:57,921
that many elements had constituents
that had slightly different masses.

105
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:01,950
They were chemically similar, but
they had sightly different masses.

106
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,980
And this is a plot made by
a man named Harold Urey,

107
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,767
a great chemist,
which showed the filled dots

108
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:17,307
are the known isotopes,
isotopes known at the time.

109
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:22,341
And he perceived a pattern
here that led down

110
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:30,538
to the possible prediction of isotopes
that had not yet been observed.

111
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:35,526
There are some other clues, and

112
00:09:35,526 --> 00:09:41,441
actually in the additional materials

113
00:09:41,441 --> 00:09:48,844
there's some guidance
to those discoveries.

114
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:50,910
Those are these two contributions.

115
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:56,837
The discovery of deuterium, which is
a collection of the original papers,

116
00:09:56,837 --> 00:10:01,464
and then a sort of a simplified
account written for, well,

117
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:04,520
a professional association journal,

118
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,820
which is a summary account of how
deuterium was discovered by Urey.

119
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,406
I should mention that at the time,
virtually all of the isotopes that

120
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:22,550
had been discovered had been discovered
by mass spectrometry, in which

121
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,190
you put particles through a combination
of cross-magnetic and electric fields and

122
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,085
find a deflection that is dependent
upon the charge-to-mass ratio.

123
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:39,635
In the case of hydrogen,
there's a stable molecular ion,

124
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:43,520
H2+ which has the mass of two expected,

125
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,071
two units of proton mass
that would be expected of

126
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:52,845
the heavy isotope of hydrogen and
the same charge.

127
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:59,164
And there's a lot of interference
from the electric signal, so

128
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:05,725
there was no conclusive proof of
the existence of heavy hydrogen.

129
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,084
So Urey had the idea of looking for

130
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:13,488
this heavy isotope of hydrogen in
the optical spectrum of atomic hydrogen.

131
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:18,549
And here is how he states his idea.

132
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:22,510
This is taken from his
Nobel lecture of 1934.

133
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,829
Bohr's theory, given some 20 years ago,
permits the calculation

134
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:33,781
of the Ballmer spectrum of the heavier
isotopes of hydrogen from this spectrum

135
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:39,839
of hydrogen by the well-known theoretical
formula for the Rydberg constant.

136
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:47,314
So even though by this time, 1934,
we had Schroedinger mechanics,

137
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:57,087
And Urey was the first American
author of a monograph-type

138
00:11:57,087 --> 00:12:03,120
textbook on quantum mechanics,
very familiar with the subject.

139
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,430
He preferred to describe to
the general audience the plausibility

140
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,900
of his idea in terms of
Bohr's well-accepted theory.

141
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,665
Now basically,

142
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:20,956
the difference in the spectrum of
a heavy isotope of hydrogen from regular

143
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:26,606
hydrogen in the Bohr theory can just be
traced to the reduced mass difference.

144
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:33,304
So in the online quiz,
you get a chance to think about that.

145
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:41,303
So no one had seen a heavy
isotope of hydrogen.

146
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:45,413
Urey thought it might be detected in
the optical spectrum of atomic hydrogen.

147
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:49,080
But how to prove that decisively?

148
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:59,839
He had the idea of taking large
quantities of liquid hydrogen,

149
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,882
cryogenic fluid, evaporating the liquid,

150
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:09,393
in which in the process of evaporation,

151
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:16,561
presumably the lighter isotope
will evaporate more rapidly and

152
00:13:16,561 --> 00:13:24,050
so the heavier isotope will be
concentrated in the residue.

153
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,527
So he recruited a man named
Ferdinand Graft Brickwedde,

154
00:13:27,527 --> 00:13:32,607
who was United States' leading expert in
low-temperature physics at that time.

155
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:38,743
He was the first person to produce
liquid helium in the United States,

156
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:43,952
and so Brickwedde carried out
this distillation process.

157
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:50,165
You can read about it in the summary
article if you're interested,

158
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:55,914
and produced a sample,
In which it was possible

159
00:13:55,914 --> 00:14:01,270
to find the evidence for
the heavy isotope hydrogen.

160
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,949
So this is an emissions

161
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:11,467
spectrum.

162
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:16,104
In this particular figure it happens to be
from the Balmer beta line in this spectrum

163
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:19,132
that we've been talking
about all this time.

164
00:14:19,132 --> 00:14:26,370
And here's the central peak, so really
this peak continues up off the scale.

165
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,660
And now here is the prediction
from the Bohr theory

166
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,850
of where an isotope of mass 2 should be.

167
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,822
And you see that these three
curves are spectra taken under

168
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:46,107
different hypothetical
concentration of the heavy isotope.

169
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:50,430
And so
that predicted feature grows as expected.

170
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,358
There's no evidence for a mass 3 isotope.

171
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,885
There is a mass 3 isotope, tritium, but

172
00:14:55,885 --> 00:14:58,810
it's unstable and
it has a very low abundance.

173
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,810
So this is a nice application of
a very simple reduced mass picture

174
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,550
provided by Bohr.

175
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:13,310
The discovery of a substance that in 1931,
no one knew it existed.
