00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,560
Hello everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,670
So now we're going to go and
solve the problem for

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,270
the classical motion of the hydrogen atom.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,506
Now some of you may have done this before,
but we're going to do it in a way that

5
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:18,947
leads to some of the material that's
essential for the development of quantum

6
00:00:18,947 --> 00:00:23,189
mechanics, particularly understanding
the angle momentum operator and

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,496
some other symmetry operators that
are very important in quantum theory and

8
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:31,294
give us the actual insight into
how to solve equations in general.

9
00:00:34,194 --> 00:00:37,242
So to return where we left off last time,

10
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:41,017
we have these first-order
equations of motion.

11
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:46,503
Now let's try to make some progress in
solving them by isolating invariant

12
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:52,877
quantities, that is, constants of the
motions, things that don't change in time.

13
00:00:52,877 --> 00:00:56,297
I mean, you know what some of these are,
for example, the total energy.

14
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:03,722
So now,
since we're given equations of motion for

15
00:01:03,722 --> 00:01:08,222
these two vector quantities,
it makes sense to try to find constants of

16
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:11,680
the motion by looking at
various other products.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,860
So here is the kinetic
energy of the system,

18
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,480
something of which you're familiar with.

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,287
Write it as p squared/2 mu, it's
the same as one half mu r dot squared.

20
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:32,201
And now, just as a check to see
how well you're following things,

21
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:37,090
here's a little online quiz on the actual
meaning of this T, the kinetic energy.

22
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,505
So I hope it's clear that
the kinetic energy is expressed here

23
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:47,970
is in the frame in which
the center of mass is at rest.

24
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,625
Because it just deals,

25
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:54,696
this p has to do with the motion
of the relative coordinate.

26
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:59,070
So the electron and
the nucleus together could be

27
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,465
moving as a million miles an hour with
respect to your frame of reference, but

28
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:09,660
it's in the frame of the center mass that
the expressions become most economical.

29
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,110
And then here is a,
this is actually something that happens

30
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:23,007
quite generally in any system of
particles interacting by pairwise forces.

31
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:27,773
You can see that the time derivative,
the kinetic energy,

32
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:33,588
just following the Newtonian force laws,
is minus the timed derivative

33
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:39,650
of this quantity minus the timed
derivative of the potential energy.

34
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,970
So, the potential energy here,

35
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:52,040
when added to the kinetic energy, gives a
constant of motion, meaning that when you

36
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,250
start the system with an arbitrary
configuration of the two particles,

37
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,610
that is the positions and the velocities
are what they are at some initial time.

38
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,015
Then at any later time, you then
compute the total energy in terms of

39
00:03:07,015 --> 00:03:09,427
the sum of the kinetic and
potential energies.

40
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:15,467
And at any later time, that sum
adds up to exactly the same thing.

41
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:25,480
Now I'll have a quick check to see
about your understanding of this point.

42
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,710
So I hope it was clear that from
the construction, the potential

43
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:38,650
energy depending upon the relative
coordinate, it actually doesn't matter,

44
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,930
at least in non-relativistic mechanics,
whether that's in

45
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:49,600
the frame at rest or in the frame moving
with the center of mass, it's the same.

46
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,797
Okay, so the result of that is
we found one constant of motion,

47
00:03:56,797 --> 00:04:02,161
meaning this helps reduce
the complexity of the system since that

48
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:08,890
we know that however the particles may
evolve from their initial configuration,

49
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,787
it's always the case that their
energy has the same value.

50
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:17,830
So they can't move all
over configuration space.

51
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,675
You might say that this defines a sort
of a surface in the multi-dimensional

52
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:26,171
space on which the particles
are constrained to move.

53
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,697
Not to belabor the point, but

54
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:35,080
why don't we have another quick check to
see how well you're following things?

55
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,080
So I hope the results of that last
quiz were pretty transparent.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,979
I mean, once again,
the energy is the energy in

57
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,767
the frame that's fixed
on the center of mass.

58
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:57,420
Okay, so we had a process of starting
with a product of variables and

59
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,182
finding a sort of a conservation
law that related its time

60
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:06,167
derivatives to another
function of position.

61
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:10,622
So why not proceed systematically
on those lines and

62
00:05:10,622 --> 00:05:16,807
see if there are other products that
have a fairly simple tiny dilution?

63
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,493
So to put it another way, this,

64
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:28,307
the kinetic energy is
proportional to p dot p.

65
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:33,403
So then there are two other scalar
products of these two vectors,

66
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:34,800
r dot r and r dot p.

67
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,810
And I think you will find that

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,760
there's nothing simple about the time
evolution of either of those.

69
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:52,359
So how do we proceed in
some systematic fashion?

70
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,170
Well there are three possible scalar
products of the vectors r and

71
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:04,370
p, and then there's one vector product.

72
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,047
Because r cross r as 0 as p cross p.

73
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:17,487
Now here I am assuming,
Basic knowledge, Of vector algebra.

74
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:24,367
So I mean, I hope you do understand.

75
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:29,061
If you don't understand what the vector
cross product and dot product are,

76
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:32,447
this would be a good time to pause and
take a refresher.

77
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,127
But the basic idea is that things
like the dot product is something

78
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:43,290
that's invariant under rotation
of all the coordinates in

79
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,580
the system, that's a so
called scalar on the rotation.

80
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,180
The vector product is sort of
the next degree of complexity.

81
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,920
It acts like a vector under rotation.

82
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,950
So, a vector, when you rotate it,
assumes a different orientation.

83
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,870
In general, a rotation changes
a vector into another vector.

84
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:13,550
The dot product is proportional of the
cosine of the angle between two vectors.

85
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,260
And if you rotate the system,
that clearly stays the same.

86
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:24,864
So here is this, Quantity, the cross
product of the position momentum.

87
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:27,044
What is its equation of motion?

88
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:35,061
Well, it's straightforward to
compute the time derivative of that,

89
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:40,230
L dot by definition is r dot
cross p + r cross p dot.

90
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,303
Okay, so now, what about that?

91
00:07:42,303 --> 00:07:47,139
Well r dot, Is

92
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,823
just proportional to p, so
that means that this is equal to 0.

93
00:07:51,823 --> 00:07:54,000
Now, what about the second term?

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,850
Well, p dot is proportional
to the vector r,

95
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,880
not as a complicated coefficient,
but in terms of the cross product,

96
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,320
this becomes proportional r dot r,
so also equal to 0.

97
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,217
So here's the second constant of motion,
the angular momentum r cross p.

98
00:08:17,277 --> 00:08:20,960
So, let me say two things about this.

99
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,941
And that is this result
that the angular momentum

100
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:29,707
is a constant of motion is generic for

101
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:37,060
systems in which the force is
the gradient of a radial function.

102
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:44,100
There's no dependence of the force on the
relative angle between the two particles.

103
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,370
And the second is,
this puts a very strong constraint

104
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:58,070
on the possible motions that can occur
from given initial conditions, and we'll

105
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:03,400
review that in the next online quiz, which
is going to be the last for this part.

106
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,060
So I hope it was clear to you in
thinking about that, that for example,

107
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:18,000
here's the defining,
here's the definition of angular momentum.

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,230
And so
this means that r dot L is equal to 0.

109
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,580
Let's see, how do we see that?

110
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,424
Well, we know that r cross p

111
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:40,478
is perpendicular to r and p,

112
00:09:40,478 --> 00:09:47,920
very simple result of vector algebra.

113
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,740
So that means that L, which is, we've
determined is fixed in space for all time.

114
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,260
So let's say at any given time,

115
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,220
we have a value of the position and
the value of the momentum.

116
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,840
From those, we determine the value
of the angular momentum just by

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,810
taking the cross product, very simple.

118
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,280
And then forever after, the value of
the angular momentum stays the same,

119
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,320
so that r is always perpendicular to L.

120
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,050
Well that means it lies, I mean,
if you draw, let's orient L, so

121
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,500
it's sort of standing up straight.

122
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,240
That means that r is moving in the plane
that must always be in the two dimensional

123
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,390
plane that's perpendicular to L and
that the same thing is true with p.

124
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,330
So in other words,

125
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,020
the conservation of angular momentum takes
us from a problem, which is sort of three

126
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,020
dimensional in its formulation and
reduces it to motion in two dimensions.

127
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,570
That's a huge reduction in complexity.

128
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:58,098
So we now know that all we have to do
is to enumerate the allowed values of

129
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:03,853
angular momentum and
then to solve the equations of motion for

130
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:08,407
the particular values of
the angle of momentum.

131
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:12,620
And that is going to pass through into
quantum mechanics in a very important way.
