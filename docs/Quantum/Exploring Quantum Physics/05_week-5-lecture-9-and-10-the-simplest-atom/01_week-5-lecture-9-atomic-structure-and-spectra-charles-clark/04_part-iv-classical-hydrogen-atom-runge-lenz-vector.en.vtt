00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.650
Welcome back everyone to
Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.780
Now, were going to complete the solution
of hydrogen atom according to

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.280
class mechanics and

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.040
this brings in the identification
of non-trivial concept of motion.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.581
This something that was known for many
years by people setting planetary motion,

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:28.699
but emerged as something of great
importance in the development

7
00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.816
of quantum mechanics and
I think you'll see that it points one to

8
00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:39.692
directions that are very fruitfully
used when one goes to solving

9
00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:43.704
equation for complex systems,
well we'll see.

10
00:00:43.704 --> 00:00:47.361
Now, just to remind you where we are,
we're still working on,

11
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:52.065
wer're leading up to the Bohr model of
the atom by solving the classical problem.

12
00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:54.371
So, when you do the homework,

13
00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:58.559
you'll probably be reminded
of some of this material.

14
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.050
Again, I just like to keep in view
that our objective is to understand

15
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.960
real physical systems.

16
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.930
And maybe some of you are tiring
of seeing these spectral lines,

17
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.840
but I never get tired of them.

18
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.210
Okay, here's where we left things
at the end of the last lecture.

19
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.470
We have these two constants in motion,
energy and angular momentum and

20
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.930
that means we know whatever the initial
configurations of the particles are,

21
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.090
they move in a plain that is
determined by the initial orientation.

22
00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:41.125
And then, the motion in that plane is also
restricted to have a constant energy.

23
00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:46.845
So then basically, there's going to
be an orbit in the plane, because you

24
00:01:49.735 --> 00:01:56.350
can't have a continuous,
well at any given point,

25
00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.650
there'll be some limits in the motion
that are determined by the energy.

26
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.475
As we shall see.

27
00:02:02.475 --> 00:02:09.564
Okay, now how do we make progress?

28
00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:14.050
Well, we started with these two
first order equations and motion.

29
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:21.075
Now, we then for the vectors r and p.

30
00:02:21.075 --> 00:02:27.350
Then, we took scalar products,

31
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.630
you might say r is a scalar, r is
the square root in the scalar product.

32
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.160
And we found that there
was a conserved quantity,

33
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.790
the energy that just depended upon the
scalar products of the vectors themselves.

34
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.600
Then, there was a vector
constant of motion

35
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.000
naming them r cross p,
that's also a constant in time.

36
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:56.090
Well, what other things
do we have to look at.

37
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.720
Well, from the value of angle momentum,

38
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.450
we know that r and p lie in a plane.

39
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:17.100
So, what other independent vectors do
we have that might lie in the plane.

40
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.720
I think you'll easily see that
these two are cross L and

41
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.710
p cross L both lie in
the same plane as r and p.

42
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.610
So, maybe there's some advantage.

43
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.060
And they're independent variables.

44
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.860
Maybe, there's some advantage to
looking at the equations of motion.

45
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.159
When framed in terms of
these two new factors.

46
00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:46.146
Because after all, since they line
the same plane, it's quite possible

47
00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:51.141
that there's a simpler relationship
between all four of these vectors.

48
00:03:51.141 --> 00:03:55.879
Than is, that meets the eye right now.

49
00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.042
Okay, let's see what progress we can make.

50
00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:03.802
So here's let's take our cross L and
look at it in greater depth,

51
00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:08.640
so then we can just say that's,
that's simply that.

52
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.720
R cross P.

53
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.520
Which is then just substituting for
r and r dot takes that form.

54
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.000
Now, were going to invoke
a well known vector

55
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.030
identity to this is the so
called bac-cab rule.

56
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.770
Again, this is going to come up again in
the Quantum Theory of Angular Momentum.

57
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.450
So, it's a good idea for you to at least
be aware that such a thing exists,

58
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.990
and then later on we'll see how you'll
develop a sort of vector calculus

59
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.760
that will help you easily rederive it.

60
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.640
So this is how you,
when you have two cross products,

61
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.070
you can reduce them and simplify them.

62
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.400
And so that gives.

63
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.146
When one goes through the math,

64
00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:15.880
here's this just rewriting that identity.

65
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.790
Then from the bac-cab rule,
you get something that's

66
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.330
proportionate to the position vector and
the velocity vector.

67
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.830
And now, a remarkable thing happens.

68
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.760
When you simplify this and I think it's
really worth your writing notes on this or

69
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.060
freezing the screen,
pausing the screen and taking yourself.

70
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.709
This is a very elementary derivation,

71
00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:51.350
just a sequence of simple steps,

72
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:56.385
and you see what it gives you is

73
00:05:56.385 --> 00:06:02.428
that R cross L is the time derivative

74
00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:08.090
of the unit vector times r cubed.

75
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.040
Now, what about p cross L?

76
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:21.030
Let's look at its, let's look at
the time derivative of P cross L.

77
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.650
So that is just, I mean this is an obvious

78
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.510
identity since L dot is zero and
so we now get.

79
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.650
Another cross product for r cross L.

80
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.458
So, in other words, well,
let's just see where that takes us.

81
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.315
So, you see that r cross

82
00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:57.910
L Is equal to r cubed times
unit vector of r dots.

83
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.850
So, this equation implies

84
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.796
that r unit vector dot is equal to

85
00:07:07.796 --> 00:07:13.330
minus r cross L,

86
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.490
divided by r cubed, but
you see that's what we have here.

87
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.030
So, that means that this vector the sum

88
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:30.809
of p cross L and
the unit vector of r is a constant motion.

89
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.350
This is often called
the Runge Lens vector.

90
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.930
There's a Wikipedia article on this
that's very, very useful, very readable,

91
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:47.470
very informative but I hope I've
given you a path to rederiving it.

92
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.690
Actually, when you know
that something exists.

93
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.680
When you know that there's something
involving p cross L the results

94
00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.580
in the cost of the motion then you
should be able to calculate it again for

95
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.130
this system.

96
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.140
Now, the remarkable thing here we are we
have the energy, we have the [INAUDIBLE],

97
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.410
we have the Runge-Lenz vector.

98
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.621
The remarkable thing is that the,
in some sense, the identification

99
00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:19.291
of the Runge-Lenz vector solves
the problem for us because, look at this.

100
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:28.740
Let's calculate the scalar product of r.A,

101
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.078
which is r A Cosine phi if.

102
00:08:37.336 --> 00:08:43.826
This is r, and that's A and that's phi.

103
00:08:43.826 --> 00:08:51.574
So, first of all we know that
A lies in the same plane.

104
00:08:51.574 --> 00:08:58.150
As r and p, and so we now know,

105
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.098
so that means that

106
00:09:02.098 --> 00:09:07.887
the location of r is more or

107
00:09:07.887 --> 00:09:13.151
less precisely defined

108
00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:17.380
by the angle phi.

109
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:24.260
Okay, but now taking r.A just from here,
using this identity,

110
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:32.150
to r A consign phi is this quantity here.

111
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:38.593
Now, here is here is one of these
vector identities A dot B cross C.

112
00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:44.820
I hope you recognize what to do with that.

113
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:50.730
And if you can recall their identity, you
can use it to complete the inline quiz or

114
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.160
you can try computing
that directly yourself.

115
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.160
And in any event,
let's have a look at the quiz.

116
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.955
Okay, so dealing with this

117
00:10:04.955 --> 00:10:08.863
it's A dot B cross c.

118
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.630
There's a cyclic identity.

119
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.700
That's equal to, let's say we move
everything around cyclically.

120
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:23.057
That's equal to

121
00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:30.330
C.(A x B) = B dot C.

122
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:37.630
C cross

123
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.920
A.
And so on.

124
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.380
And so in other words,

125
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.310
this term just reduces to
the square of the angular momentum.

126
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.380
And so now, let's see.

127
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.874
I'm sorry for making such a mess here.

128
00:10:53.874 --> 00:10:55.545
Let's try to get rid of it.

129
00:10:58.306 --> 00:11:02.649
It's a very straightforward derivation.

130
00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:09.081
Well, now you see we have a very simple
equation that relates r and phi.

131
00:11:15.136 --> 00:11:16.770
Thusly.

132
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.810
So, here is an equation
that defines the orbit.

133
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.310
It shows r as A rather simple
function of the angle phi.

134
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:29.350
And that's,
apart from specifying the origin of

135
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.100
time or once you have the values
of these constants to

136
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:38.300
the motion,
things pretty much fall into place.

137
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.670
So let's see, we've gone on for
quite a while.

138
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.990
So one final calculation
that we'll do here.

139
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:55.020
We have, this is by the way, an orbit
which can be a circle, an ellipse or

140
00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:01.140
a hyperbole and the distinction between
those depends upon the energies.

141
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:09.750
There's one last calculation that is worth
doing and that is to calculate A squared.

142
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:12.990
And I'm going to leave that
to you as an exercise.

143
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:18.110
It's worth doing because it's a fairly
straight forward calculation and

144
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:22.990
this is, that calculation gives us
a relationship between the magnitude of

145
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.800
A between the energy and the angle.

146
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:32.710
So in other words, the energy angle,
the angle momentum, and

147
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.760
the Runge-Lenz vector are each
constants in motion but

148
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.510
as this equation shows they
are not entirely dependent.

149
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:49.170
Okay forgive me but these is literally
the last of the in line quizzes.

150
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:54.380
For the moment, and what, what it's
going to be used for is to show you

151
00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:01.750
the significance of
the value of the energy.

152
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.394
In other words for this system,
as we'll see, the energy can be any,

153
00:13:06.394 --> 00:13:08.535
well let's just take the quiz.

154
00:13:11.403 --> 00:13:16.462
So I hope you persuaded
yourself that the energy

155
00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:21.395
of this system can be
absolutely anything from

156
00:13:21.395 --> 00:13:26.190
between minus infinity and infinity.

157
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:33.620
For example, you can have the momentum
vanish at some given time.

158
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.340
You just have these god like powers for
specifying these conditions.

159
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:44.910
You can keep p at 0 and then bring
the particles arbitrarily together,

160
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.550
arbitrarily large, negative energy or

161
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:53.729
you can move to some finite value of r and

162
00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:58.750
then crank up the value of
p to whatever you need.

163
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.630
You can make it as positive as you'd like.

164
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.290
And once you fix the energy,
it stays that way for all time.

165
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:11.090
And now the critical thing to remember,
this has to do with

166
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:16.818
some of the readings in the supplementary
material would be in the homework.

167
00:14:16.818 --> 00:14:23.460
Is that there's a point of separation

168
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.880
between positive energies or between
negative energies and positive energies.

169
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.620
So when the energy is less than 0.

170
00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:34.390
All the orbits are elliptical, so

171
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.200
these are like the orbits of
the planets about the sun.

172
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.310
You can get the highly elliptical orbits,
their far distance away.

173
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:48.410
Those orbits have negative energies,
but they're approaching zero.

174
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.480
For e greater than zero,

175
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.520
you have a type of trajectory
where let's say here's the proton,

176
00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:01.380
the electron comes in and just,
it just visits once and never leaves.

177
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:06.070
So these two types of classical orbits

178
00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.490
actually have counter parts on
the Quantum Mechanical Spectrum.
