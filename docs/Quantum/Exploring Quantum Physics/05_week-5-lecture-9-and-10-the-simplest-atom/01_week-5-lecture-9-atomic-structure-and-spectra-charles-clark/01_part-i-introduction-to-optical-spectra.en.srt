00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,210
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,770
Welcome back to exploring Quantum Physics,
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,235
This week, we're going to look at solving
some of the practical problems of quantum

4
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:16,318
mechanics using the vehicle of the theory
of atomic structure and spectra.

5
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:19,173
We'll start with an overview
of optical spectrosopy,

6
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:23,650
it's a subject with great scientific and
technological importance.

7
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,350
In some sense it's responsible for
modern telecommunications infrastructure,

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:31,250
the knowledge that we have about
the properties of the sun and stars.

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,930
And it's one that provided really
compelling evidence, a very

10
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,800
deep quantitative evidence, for
the existence of quantum mechanics.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:50,638
Now from the course homepage you can get
to this section, Additional Materials.

12
00:00:50,638 --> 00:00:55,108
And within it you'll find a section
called, Original scientific literature.

13
00:00:55,108 --> 00:01:01,008
And we will be using two of
the papers here in the homework.

14
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:07,453
Bohr model of the atom, and, The
photoelectric affect, a paper by Einstein.

15
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:11,214
You'll really need to look at these in
order to answer some of the homework

16
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:12,790
questions.

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:18,190
It does not require the reading of
the full paper, but I hope you will get

18
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:24,498
some enjoyment out of having read original
work by Niels Boor and Albert Einstein.

19
00:01:29,193 --> 00:01:32,400
You're all familiar with
a beautiful rainbow.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,030
An effect seen when sunlight
is scattered in a certain way.

21
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,995
And it seems that all the colors that we
can perceive are found within the rainbow.

22
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:49,328
Now here's an important tool for
spectroscopy.

23
00:01:49,328 --> 00:01:55,598
We have white light entering
into this prism here.

24
00:01:55,598 --> 00:02:01,220
And then you see output of a band
of colors running from red to blue.

25
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,080
This technique, this is basically what you
might call a deep multiplexing system.

26
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,110
The pure white light comes in and

27
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,970
what comes out is a spread
out mixture of colors.

28
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,230
This is the technique used by
Isaac Newton to demonstrate

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,340
that white light of the sun was
indeed a mixture of colors.

30
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,420
Because what he did was pick
off a particular color,

31
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,200
let's say the blue, and
put it through a second prism

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,265
to find that no further
separation of the color occurred.

33
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:36,448
So, from the modern perspective,
color is a proxy for

34
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:40,844
the wavelength or
the frequency of the light,

35
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:46,608
which are related by this characteristic,
wave equation.

36
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:51,190
The frequency of a wave motion is equal
to its speed divided by its wavelength.

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,695
Now here's a rather clever
demonstration of the inverse action of

38
00:02:58,695 --> 00:02:59,888
the separation light.

39
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:06,887
This is a multiplexing effect,
where one combines a violet,

40
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:12,150
a green, and
a red light by the following way.

41
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,730
There's a laser, you can't really see it.

42
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,818
These are cylinders of water
with a hole poured into it.

43
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:22,395
And when they're illuminated
from behind the laser light is

44
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:27,070
entrained in the stream of water
that's falling into a dish.

45
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,880
And what you see coming out of
the dish is scattered light.

46
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,610
It's just a random mixture of the violet,
the green, and the red colors, so

47
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,720
it looks white.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,370
So in other words,

49
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,230
this shows the combination of
these three different colors.

50
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,320
It gives apparent white light.

51
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,610
Now I use this illustration
in part to introduce

52
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,810
the three reference lasers that we'll
use for discussions during the course.

53
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,028
These are three commonly used laser
lights that you've seen in practice.

54
00:03:59,028 --> 00:04:04,323
For example, the red laser pointer
with a wavelength of 650 nm is widely

55
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:09,990
used in lectures and presentations,
as is the green laser pointer.

56
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,580
The diode pumped solid state green laser
pointer with the wavelength of 532 nm.

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,822
And then the Blu-Ray laser
player utilizes a violet

58
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:25,630
laser with a wavelength of 405 nm.

59
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,820
These spread the range of
human vision as we'll see, and

60
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,018
so they provide a good set of basic tools.

61
00:04:33,018 --> 00:04:35,193
If you want to remember
properties of light,

62
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:37,378
it's nice to have some specific examples.

63
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:45,088
So we'll use these the number of points
in the lectures and the homework.

64
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:49,543
Okay, now we'll just have the first and
only inline quiz of this introductory

65
00:04:49,543 --> 00:04:53,950
lecture to give you some practice in
thinking about the properties of light.

66
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,950
So, the main message of the inline
quiz was that when you combine

67
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,420
two photons to produce a third,

68
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,240
you add the energies of the two photons
to get the energy of the third.

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,157
So that the light from
the green laser pointer is made

70
00:05:11,157 --> 00:05:15,860
my combining the energy
of two infrared photons.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,830
Now the rainbow is a very smooth
appearing object, and those colors that

72
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,510
you saw dispersed by the prism also
seem to form a relatively smooth band.

73
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,204
But about almost exactly 200 years ago,
Joseph Fraunhofer,

74
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:39,043
looking at the spectrum of
sun with high resolution,

75
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:44,788
found that it exhibited a number of rather
sharp features of a mysterious type.

76
00:05:48,428 --> 00:05:52,530
And here is a modern study
of the spectrum of the sun.

77
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,960
The rainbow has been sort of
spread out here, and stretched, so

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,000
that you can see very narrow
regions of wavelength

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,570
where there are dark spots
in the structure of the sun.

80
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,300
Here are reference lasers laid out
roughly where their wavelengths lie.

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,920
And this notch here is going to be
of great interest to us later on.

82
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,744
So when this phenomena was discovered
it was not understood at all.

83
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:37,004
And there was no physical theory
that suggested why the smooth

84
00:06:37,004 --> 00:06:43,190
light of the sun should be disrupted by so
many apparent imperfections.
