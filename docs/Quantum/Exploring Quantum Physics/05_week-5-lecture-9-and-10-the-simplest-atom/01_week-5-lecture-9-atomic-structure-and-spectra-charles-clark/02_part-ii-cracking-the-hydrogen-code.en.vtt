00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.011
Hello everyone, welcome back.

2
00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:08.218
We're now going to look a little bit more
deeply into these mysterious gaps in

3
00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:09.433
the solar spectrum.

4
00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:18.150
So just to remind you when seen at
high resolution, the light of the sun

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.816
exhibits these dim spots which could
be interpreted as absorption features.

6
00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.210
Indeed, that's what they are.

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.151
There's a complimentary phenomenon
with which you're probably familiar.

8
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:39.243
You undoubtedly have seen these
vivid gas signs, neon signs that

9
00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:44.809
are often called in the United States
that exhibit very bright colors.

10
00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.426
And these are due to
the very sharp emission

11
00:00:49.426 --> 00:00:54.434
lines that are observed
in low density gases.

12
00:00:57.835 --> 00:01:03.621
Here are two pertinent examples,
one is a spectra of atomic Hydrogen.

13
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:08.751
It's a discharge lamp, and
what you're seeing here

14
00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:14.459
is the increase in the wavelength
going from left to right.

15
00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:21.298
And you see very distinct isolated lines.

16
00:01:25.257 --> 00:01:28.402
Red, a sort of a cyan, a blue and violet.

17
00:01:28.402 --> 00:01:33.616
Actually rather near our reference
laser points this red line of Hydrogen

18
00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:39.265
656 nanometers Balmer alpha, this is
the Balmer beta and so on, so called.

19
00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:44.558
And down below the spectrum of neon,
more complicated but

20
00:01:44.558 --> 00:01:49.635
as you can see,
it consists of fairly well-resolved,

21
00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:53.523
quite sharp lines, rather than the sort of

22
00:01:53.523 --> 00:01:58.400
rainbow feature that we see for
dispersed sunlight.

23
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.594
Now as it happens,
the emission lines that are observed in

24
00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:10.702
the low density gasses often correspond
to the absorption features of the sun.

25
00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:18.411
In fact, this line at 656 nanometers
is this large dark gap here.

26
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:23.936
This line is down here I believe and
the others have

27
00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:30.920
their counterparts in the relevant
portions of the spectrum.

28
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.200
So it became understood
that the features seen in

29
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.360
the absorption spectrum in
the sun were due to the,

30
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.172
the same transitions that were giving
rise to emission in low density gases.

31
00:02:50.172 --> 00:02:54.948
But the presence of these sharp and
distinct lines in

32
00:02:54.948 --> 00:03:00.266
atoms was a great puzzle
because in classical mechanics,

33
00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:06.342
a system of interacting particles
can have any set of positions and

34
00:03:06.342 --> 00:03:10.792
velocities, and
there's nothing to single out

35
00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:15.706
a particular configuration for
special attention.

36
00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:21.037
So, atomic theory at the end
of the 19th century had

37
00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:27.689
many clever ideas deriving from
things like vortices and fluids.

38
00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.868
Where there was some type of a regular
structure that could be inferred.

39
00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:37.738
But none of these bore any fruit in terms
of explaining the specific properties of

40
00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:38.892
atomic spectrum.

41
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:46.911
I'll just mention in passing that
the vortex knot idea is coming

42
00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:52.631
back into vogue in atomic physics
due to the ability to produce

43
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:58.463
vortex structures in gases,
in those Einstein condensates.

44
00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:02.510
But, I mean these are not
elementary atomic structures,

45
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.300
they're rather a type of super fluid
pattern that can be generated by

46
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.453
appropriate excitation of the condensate.

47
00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:18.100
But the whole idea of
the continuum models,

48
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.905
as atoms as some kind of fluid,
confronted a real

49
00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:28.416
difficulty in the discovery
that atoms seemed to be made

50
00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:33.458
of particles interacting
with electric charges,

51
00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:38.053
and thereby interacting
by electric forces.

52
00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:43.345
Notable development was
Rutherford's experiment in 1911

53
00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:49.029
that showed that virtually all of
the mass of the atom is concentrated

54
00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:55.411
in a minute fraction of its volume,
one whatever that is, a quadrillionth.

55
00:04:55.411 --> 00:05:00.850
So it was as if this thing
that had a pretty well-defined

56
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.364
size is known from
a variety of measurements,

57
00:05:05.364 --> 00:05:13.590
some as simple as looking at the thickness
of an oil film on the surface of water.

58
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.900
Taking the volume of
the ordinary oil drop and seeing

59
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.730
how far it would spread out gives a pretty
good indication of the size of an atom.

60
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.199
And most of it from Rutherford's
experiment had to be empty space

61
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.710
with all the mass
concentrated at the center.

62
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.555
So, this is actually a system
somewhat like the planetary system.

63
00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:48.123
The sun is very massive, it sits
near the center of the solar system,

64
00:05:48.123 --> 00:05:55.498
and the Earth has a much smaller mass and
stands off from the sun and orbits it.

65
00:05:55.498 --> 00:06:00.725
We're going to see what
classical mechanics has to say

66
00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:09.778
about the about the planetary, Atom.

67
00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:15.739
That is one consisting of two
particles ordinarily well-separated

68
00:06:15.739 --> 00:06:22.355
in an orbit very much like the orbits
of the planet the solar system.

69
00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:28.725
This year is the 100th anniversary of
this great discovery by Niels Bohr,

70
00:06:28.725 --> 00:06:32.939
which is reported in
the paper that's contained in

71
00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:37.251
the additional materials section for
this course.

72
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:41.627
And Bohr developed the postulate that

73
00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:46.145
there were certain planetary orbits,

74
00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:57.478
Of the electron about the proton in
a hydrogen atom that would be stable and

75
00:06:57.478 --> 00:07:02.185
that would correspond to
the stationary states of atoms.

76
00:07:02.185 --> 00:07:08.498
So he basically solved the equations
of motion for the planetary system.

77
00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:09.640
There's nothing novel about that.

78
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.369
Those solutions are well known.

79
00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.167
And than stated a postulate
that certain of

80
00:07:16.167 --> 00:07:21.764
the orbits in an atom would
provide the stationary

81
00:07:21.764 --> 00:07:26.570
states that were seen in optical spectra.

82
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:33.263
And then that the radiation absorbed
in atoms would be associated as in this

83
00:07:33.263 --> 00:07:38.469
case here with an atom falling
from a higher energy state,

84
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:42.188
larger orbit into a lower energy state and

85
00:07:42.188 --> 00:07:46.248
emitting a photon into
the radiation field.

86
00:07:46.248 --> 00:07:53.788
So that the frequency of the light
that is seen either in absorption or

87
00:07:53.788 --> 00:07:58.728
emission corresponds
to the energy transfer

88
00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:03.417
between the atom and the radiation field.

89
00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.395
And in fact, the Balmer alpha line,

90
00:08:06.395 --> 00:08:10.622
the red line that we see
in the absorption spectrum,

91
00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:15.640
is 656 nanometers,
rather close to our reference laser.

92
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.900
Okay, so

93
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:24.080
let's see what classical mechanics tells
about these hydrogen-like systems.

94
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.730
So we have a single nucleus
with a position denoted by

95
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:35.580
r sub n, the mass M, the charge of +Ze.

96
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.950
Z is the atomic number, so
it'd be 1 for hydrogen, 2 for helium,

97
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.610
3 for lithium, and so on.

98
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.500
And then e is the what we
call the specific charge,

99
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.220
that's the absolute value of
the charge of the electron.

100
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:54.520
Then there's the electron described
by position vector r sub e,

101
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.965
little mass little m and
a negative charge of -e.

102
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.150
We're going to keep the masses in play

103
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.900
represented explicitly in
this treatment because

104
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.980
there's not such a big simplification
from changing them to something else.

105
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.250
And one of the exercises that we
want to do is to go through the process

106
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.930
that led to the discovery of deuterium.

107
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.900
It's a very important event, both from the
standpoint of scientific development of

108
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:27.060
nuclear physics and also the development
of nuclear energy and nuclear weapons.

109
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.204
And it was a discovery that was made by
looking at the Balmer series of hydrogen.

110
00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:38.406
Okay, now here are the Newton's equation.

111
00:09:42.283 --> 00:09:47.332
It's MA, mass times the second derivative,

112
00:09:47.332 --> 00:09:52.397
the acceleration of
the nuclear coordinate.

113
00:09:52.397 --> 00:09:55.920
And then, this is Coulomb's Law.

114
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.009
There's an equation of motion for
the nuclear coordinate.

115
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:14.925
The force on it is in the direction
of the electron nuclear distance and

116
00:10:14.925 --> 00:10:19.534
it's inversely proportional to
the square of that distance.

117
00:10:19.534 --> 00:10:22.911
You see there's a factor
of r from the vector and

118
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:27.648
a factor of r cubed below, so
that's one over r squared force law.

119
00:10:27.648 --> 00:10:33.383
And then according to Newton's, what
is it, Third Law, there's an equal but

120
00:10:33.383 --> 00:10:38.191
opposite force on the electron,
so you have the same thing there.

121
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:41.631
Now, I'm using this coordinate r here,

122
00:10:41.631 --> 00:10:45.566
which is the separation
between the nucleus and

123
00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:50.680
the electron coordinates because
that is in fact the relevant

124
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.830
length that describes
the electrical force law.

125
00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:03.520
What you can do now is you divide, okay?

126
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.458
Take this equation and divide it
by 1 over m, multiple by 1 over m.

127
00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:13.710
And you multiply this
equation by 1 over little m.

128
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.490
And you subtract them and so
you get an equation of motion for

129
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:26.330
the electron nucleus separation alone.

130
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:31.380
So you see on this side you have
the second derivative of that is just

131
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.980
a function of itself.

132
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:37.550
So we've now managed to get an equation
that can be solved directly for

133
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.910
the separation between the two particles.

134
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:49.690
So from this equation,
we go directly here, you see, we're just

135
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.410
taking the mass,
this term here is a dimension.

136
00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:02.000
This term here has
the dimensions of 1 over mass,

137
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.020
so we just invert it to get what's
called the reduced mass and

138
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.050
now we have a simple Newtonian
equation for the motion of

139
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.800
the relative distance between
the electron and the nucleus.

140
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:23.290
Now we define the momentum, p,
associated with this coordinate.

141
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.560
It's just the mass times the velocity.

142
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:32.760
The usual definition, and
this then allows us to rewrite

143
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:39.800
the equations of motion as a pair of
coupled first-order equations in time.

144
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.080
So here's that equation we just made up.

145
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.178
It's the r-dot is 1 over mu times p.

146
00:12:48.178 --> 00:12:54.048
And then p-dot is just
taken from this equation,

147
00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:58.520
because p-dot is our double dot and so

148
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.570
it's just minus Ze squared r over r cubed.

149
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:11.493
Now, why do we reduce this to first
order equations, you might ask?

150
00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:16.986
So I emphasized the development
of equations that are first-order

151
00:13:16.986 --> 00:13:22.477
in time because the whole idea of
solving the equations of motion for

152
00:13:22.477 --> 00:13:28.062
a system means that if you have
a specification of the state at time T,

153
00:13:28.062 --> 00:13:31.950
you can find it's the state
at some later time.

154
00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:38.425
For small time, that means that
you need to have an equation of

155
00:13:38.425 --> 00:13:42.485
motion that is first-order in the time for
that state.

156
00:13:42.485 --> 00:13:46.756
That's why Schrodinger's equation
must be first-order in time.

157
00:13:46.756 --> 00:13:51.398
So the whole idea of quantum
mechanics is that the wave

158
00:13:51.398 --> 00:13:54.087
function psi defines a state.

159
00:13:54.087 --> 00:13:57.294
And if we know psi at time t,

160
00:13:57.294 --> 00:14:01.899
and we know the Hamiltonian operator,

161
00:14:01.899 --> 00:14:08.330
then we can determine psi at
some slightly later time.

162
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.840
So this is something that
seems rather different

163
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.810
from some of the classical equations of
motion with which you might be familiar.

164
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.670
Here's an example to
consider in an inline quiz.

165
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:25.000
So I hope you appreciated
from that previous example,

166
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.880
that the familiar second-order wave
equation that went off and deals with.

167
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.996
It's a convenient way of
solving the wave equation.

168
00:14:33.996 --> 00:14:38.299
But it's sort of a secondary
equation that's based

169
00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:41.241
on primary first order equations.

170
00:14:41.241 --> 00:14:45.370
So, there's no real difference
between quantum mechanics and

171
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.360
classical mechanics in that respect.

172
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.971
In classical mechanics, in order to
solve the equations of motion, say for

173
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:56.799
electrodynamics, to solve
the equations of motion and time.

174
00:14:56.799 --> 00:15:03.556
You need to know the value of the electric
field and its first derivatives in time.

175
00:15:03.556 --> 00:15:05.959
Let's say, as an initial value problem.

176
00:15:05.959 --> 00:15:07.972
Whereas in quantum mechanics,

177
00:15:07.972 --> 00:15:12.742
we just have this one wave function
that provides all the information needed

178
00:15:12.742 --> 00:15:16.934
to solve the equations of motions
once the Hamiltonian's known.
