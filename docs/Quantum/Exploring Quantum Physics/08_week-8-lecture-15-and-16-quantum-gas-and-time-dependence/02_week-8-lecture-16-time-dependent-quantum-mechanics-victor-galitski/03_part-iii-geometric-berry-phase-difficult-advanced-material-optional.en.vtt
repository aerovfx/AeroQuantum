00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.390
Finally in this video we are going to
discuss a very interesting class of

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.996
quantum phenomena that appear
in the presence of slow or

3
00:00:09.996 --> 00:00:14.270
so-called adiabatic
time-dependent perturbations.

4
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.790
And such adiabatic perturbations give rise
to a very elegant mathematical structure

5
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.150
and, in particular, to so-called geometric
Berry phase that we're going to derive.

6
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.210
So this Berry phase was discovered
theoretically by Sir Michael Berry in this

7
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.900
paper published in 1984 in the Proceedings
of the Royal Society of London.

8
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.700
And this is a really very well-written and
elegant paper.

9
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
And actually, even though it's
a research level paper, which in all

10
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.170
likelihood may lead to a Nobel Prize for
Sir Michael Berry,

11
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.756
you are well-equipped to actually
understand everything in this paper.

12
00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:05.570
So both the derivation and the final
results because it requires nothing but

13
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.870
the basic knowledge of single
particle quantum mechanics,

14
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.680
the Schroedinger equation.

15
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.900
So we're going to reproduce part of
the derivation into this lecture

16
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.890
in this part, but of course,
if you want to know more details,

17
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.260
I would like to refer you to the original
paper, which again is very well-written.

18
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.030
So the problem that
Sir Michael Berry considered was,

19
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.210
well, in retrospect a very simple problem.

20
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.501
So basically it was the canonical
Schroedinger equation with some

21
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:40.416
time-dependent Hamiltonian,
and he assumed two things.

22
00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:45.151
He looked into adiabatic perturbation,
that is to say that, so

23
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:52.380
the time dependence, In H(t)

24
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.150
is assumed to be slow.

25
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.550
What it means precisely we are going to
define in the next few slides, but

26
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.490
at this stage let's just leave it at that.

27
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.920
So we have some very slowly
changing Hamiltonian.

28
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.580
And also,
let's assume that the Hamiltonian

29
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.780
returns to itself after a certain period,
let me call it capital T.

30
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.457
So basically we have a periodical
time slow perturbation.

31
00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:29.923
And the question that he asked is,
what happens with

32
00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:35.008
the wave function as we get to
this moment of time capital T?

33
00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:38.433
So what is the wave function
at the final moment of time?

34
00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:43.435
And it turned out that, as we will see,
that this wave function has a very

35
00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:48.930
interesting contribution, sort of
topological or geometric contribution.

36
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.066
There are various sort of descriptions
of it that appear in the literature.

37
00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.782
That was completely counter-intuitive and

38
00:02:57.782 --> 00:03:02.310
that takes some time to
digest even after derivation.

39
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.920
So now let me formulate the problem
that he solved more precisely and

40
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.230
proceed to the actual
solution of the problem and

41
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.250
to the formulation of this
theory of the Berry phase.

42
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.310
So let's imagine that we have
a Hamiltonian that depends on

43
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.120
a parameter lambda.

44
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.020
Okay, so this could be anything.

45
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.793
For example, it can be magnetic field or
it can be some parameters of

46
00:03:27.793 --> 00:03:32.755
a harmonic oscillator,
let's say the frequency or something else.

47
00:03:32.755 --> 00:03:37.207
So whatever you want to think about, so
let's say we have some set of parameters

48
00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:40.113
lambda and
we combine those parameter in a vector.

49
00:03:40.113 --> 00:03:44.569
So in principle it could be more than one
parameter and we just construct sort of

50
00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.110
a vector in the parameter space which
doesn't have to be three-dimensional.

51
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.631
But let me just for
the sake of simplicity,

52
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:55.565
let me imagine that I have
a three-dimensional parameter space.

53
00:03:55.565 --> 00:04:00.825
So let's say this is going to be lambda x,
lambda 1, lambda 2, lambda 3.

54
00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:05.127
Okay, and
let me consider the situation where this

55
00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:08.438
parameter lambda is changing in time.

56
00:04:08.438 --> 00:04:11.900
So for example, again, it can be
a magnetic field that has changed.

57
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.780
And also let me consider the situation
where after a certain period

58
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.072
of time capital T, so the parameter
returns to the original point.

59
00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:27.460
So if this my parameter space, so
basically what I'm talking about,

60
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.640
I'm talking about a slow evolution of this
lambda such that it starts at a certain

61
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.280
point and returns to the same
point after time capital T.

62
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.520
So and
as I advertised in the previous slides, so

63
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.030
what I want to know is what
happens with the wave function.

64
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.865
So I have some initial condition for
the wave function.

65
00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:57.420
And so the Hamiltonian after this
period capital T returns to itself.

66
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.780
But the wave function does not
necessarily have to return to itself.

67
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.370
So the question that we're interested in
is what happens with this wave function.

68
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.500
As a first step in this derivation, let me
define precisely what I mean by slow or

69
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.860
adiabatic perturbation.

70
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.965
So what does it actually mean that the
Hamiltonian is changing slowly with time?

71
00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:21.445
And to provide this definition,

72
00:05:21.445 --> 00:05:27.474
let me formulate an instantaneous
eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian.

73
00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:30.952
So the Hamiltonian itself is changing
with time, so there is no reason for

74
00:05:30.952 --> 00:05:34.264
us to write a stationary Schroedinger
equation, but nevertheless,

75
00:05:34.264 --> 00:05:36.690
mathematically it is well defined.

76
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.380
So we can consider at any moment of time
t, we can consider an eigenvalue problem

77
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.860
for this H(t) and
we can find a set of eigen functions and

78
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.055
the corresponding eigenvalues
which I denote as E sub n(t).

79
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.703
So for the sake of simplicity, let me
actually assume that the spectrum of

80
00:05:56.703 --> 00:06:01.340
the Hamiltonian is discrete, so
I have just a set of discrete levels.

81
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.095
So n=0, n=1, etc.

82
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.539
Also let me assume that
the initial condition for

83
00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:17.864
the wave function psi at t=0 is one of
the eigenstates of my Hamiltonian at t=0.

84
00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:21.652
So for the sake of concreteness
let me actually assume that

85
00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:24.610
this is the ground state, so n=0 at t=0.

86
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.550
So by the way, it's not necessary
really for the main conclusions

87
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.700
of the derivation, but for the sake of
completeness, let me just be specific.

88
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.807
Okay, now let us recall what we discussed
actually in the previous part of this

89
00:06:38.807 --> 00:06:44.870
lecture, where we dealt with the opposite
case of fast or sudden perturbations.

90
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.600
So there we know that if we
change the Hamiltonian very fast,

91
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.550
the initial state,
which in this case is the ground state,

92
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.320
would be sort of redistributed
all over the place.

93
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.410
So the particle after the quench,
or after fast sudden change,

94
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.659
would exist in all possible
eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

95
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.930
And in some sense, it's natural to
define slow perturbation as the opposite

96
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.726
to sudden perturbation,
that is to say that we will define a slow

97
00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:20.250
perturbation such that it
does not induce transitions.

98
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.481
So basically what happens here is,
let's say this is the parameter

99
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:31.628
lambda at t=0 and we have our initial
state, the ground state, with n=0 and

100
00:07:31.628 --> 00:07:37.070
as I change my lambda with time, so
these energy levels start to move.

101
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.884
So the energy levels really are these
solutions to this eigenvalue problem, but

102
00:07:41.884 --> 00:07:43.741
the Hamiltonian is changing.

103
00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:47.679
So the energy levels are moving and
in principle,

104
00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:51.538
also the explicit wave
functions are changing.

105
00:07:51.538 --> 00:07:57.065
And what I can imagine happening is that
the particle, which initially was a sort

106
00:07:57.065 --> 00:08:02.688
of confined to the ground state, can in
principle propagate to all other states.

107
00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:08.200
And this indeed will happen if the change
in the Hamiltonian is fast enough.

108
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.978
But if it is slow, and
this will be the definition of slow,

109
00:08:11.978 --> 00:08:17.020
the state of the system would remain

110
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.428
in the instantaneous ground
state of my Hamiltonian.

111
00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:23.460
And also in this case, if I start from

112
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.090
this point in the parameter space return
to the same point in the parameter space.

113
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.888
So, at the end of this particular
revolution, basically I'm requiring them

114
00:08:30.888 --> 00:08:35.320
that this system would remain
in the old grounds state.

115
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.530
And this will be my definition
of the sloped innovation.

116
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.200
So, to mathematically define
a precise condition for

117
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.870
this to happen requires
a little bit of work and

118
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.730
that provides this iteration in
the supplementary material in the nodes.

119
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.520
And if you go through this iteration,
you will see that the condition for

120
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.500
this to happen for the condition for
having no transitions is

121
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.640
that the the liberty for the Hameltonian,
which is an operator and the matrix

122
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.830
element of this thdt between two states,
let say this ground state and for

123
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:14.400
example the first excited state, this must
be much smaller than the level spacing,

124
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.520
the distance between these energy
levels divided by the typical time,

125
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.780
the characteristic time at which
the change in the Hamiltonian occurs.

126
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:32.280
So this is the definition,
if you're wondering the constraint

127
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.400
that we have to satisfy in order for
the deprivation to be slow.

128
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.790
And one thing that we notice
here is that of course if

129
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:48.700
En minus E of 0 vanishes
that is if the levels cross,

130
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.780
or if they come very close to one another,
so this condition cannot be satisfied,

131
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:57.060
because when necessary it will induce
transitions between these states.

132
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.910
But the gaps don't close, if the level
spacings remains large enough,

133
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.940
and if the change in
the Hamiltonian is slow enough.

134
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.490
So, we can satisfy this
condition to good approximation,

135
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:12.900
we can assume that the system remains in
the ground state during the evolution.

136
00:10:14.285 --> 00:10:19.255
So, now we're in the position to actually
derive this Geometric Berry phase and

137
00:10:19.255 --> 00:10:24.275
what it entails is essentially
solving the Schrödinger equation,

138
00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:29.045
the time dependent Schrödinger equation,
under the assumption of this slow

139
00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:32.225
perturbation that does
not induce transitions.

140
00:10:32.225 --> 00:10:36.360
So, this is my Schrödinger equation.

141
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.230
I'm just writing it down again.

142
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:43.398
And here,
I'm basically requiring that side

143
00:10:43.398 --> 00:10:48.710
of t remains proportional
to the ground state.

144
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:53.060
And the only thing I can
have here is a phase, right?

145
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:58.766
Because, well, the total number of
particles he is conserved so therefore,

146
00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:04.300
I cannot have here any coefficient
who's absolute value is larger than 1,

147
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.227
because it would imply that
the probability to find the particle and

148
00:11:09.227 --> 00:11:15.124
distance and the ground state is larger
than 1, and it doesn't make any sense.

149
00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:20.051
So, and I also require that well within
my approximation the transition remains

150
00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:20.998
in the ground.

151
00:11:20.998 --> 00:11:27.198
So there's basically only one possibility
for this to happen, if this efficient,

152
00:11:27.198 --> 00:11:32.352
relating the WEE function time T and
the instantaneous ground state,

153
00:11:32.352 --> 00:11:36.219
is a pure phase,
is a I FI T where I is a real function.

154
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.480
So under these assumptions,
what remains is to find this quantum fix.

155
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.900
I mean everything else we know.

156
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.293
So, this is really the remaining unknown,
in our adiabatic time dependent problem.

157
00:11:49.293 --> 00:11:54.122
And if we plug in this form of
the solution, back into the Schrodinger

158
00:11:54.122 --> 00:11:59.287
equation, and recall that by definition,
this 0t is The instantaneous

159
00:11:59.287 --> 00:12:04.283
eigen state of the Hamiltonian, so
we will simply get, so basically,

160
00:12:04.283 --> 00:12:09.986
combining these two things will lead to
the Schroedinger equation in this form.

161
00:12:09.986 --> 00:12:14.684
So it will be ih d over dt
of psi of t in this form is

162
00:12:14.684 --> 00:12:18.779
equal to the energy of the ground state,

163
00:12:18.779 --> 00:12:23.237
which is time dependent
in this case because

164
00:12:23.237 --> 00:12:27.979
the energy are moving around and
psi t, okay.

165
00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:33.290
And well so, this is no longer an operator
actually, this is just a function.

166
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.000
And naively you may sort of assume

167
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.570
that there exists a simple
solution to this problem.

168
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.790
Where phi would be equal to sort of a
generalization of the usual quantum phase

169
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:51.330
that appears even in the time independent
from, so we could naively just write it as

170
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.660
minus one over H bar
an integral from 0 to t,

171
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.580
e naught of t prime, dt prime.

172
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.650
So again, if the Hamiltonian were not to
depend on time, that is in this picture

173
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:10.210
would mean that basically lambda is just a
point, which stays there, so I would just

174
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:16.380
get the quantum phase being interval i
minus i over h bar energy times time,

175
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:21.530
which is the usual quantum phase that
appears in stationary quantum mechanics.

176
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.341
So here, instead I may just go ahead and
integrate from 0 to t.

177
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.830
Well it turns out, however,
that this is not entirely correct and

178
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:35.820
there exists an important continuation
which theorists, well to this quantum fix.

179
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.820
And let me write this contribution
as gamma, and this additional phase

180
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.490
gamma that we will derive in a second is
exactly what is called the Berry phase.

181
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.700
So, this is our main quantity of interest.

182
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.100
While the first part is sort
of the usual dynamical phase,

183
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.610
it's actually called dynamical phase.

184
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:03.710
Let me,
you note it as theta with the subscript d,

185
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:10.270
and this is called dynamical phase.

186
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.070
If we plug in now back,
basically, this expression for

187
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.660
the phase back into
the Schrodinger equation,

188
00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.830
we're going to get in the left hand side,
we're going to get the following terms.

189
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:25.830
So, there is going to be
derivative 0f either the power i,

190
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.800
theta, e to the power i, gamma.

191
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.300
And there will be
the instantaneous ground state, 0t.

192
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:41.950
And the right hand side
will remain the same.

193
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.040
So in here, we have the time [INAUDIBLE]
which is going to add on three terms, so

194
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.690
they're going to be three
contributions in the left hand side.

195
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.340
So, the first contribution
essentially by construction

196
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.280
is going to cancel out
the right hand side.

197
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.220
So, if we differentiate this exponential,
so we can just write it down,

198
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:03.759
is going to be i h bar times i theta

199
00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:09.770
d dot times psi and this theta

200
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:15.260
d dot is this the derivative for

201
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.460
this integral, which will just
pull out the value of the energy.

202
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:26.160
So, this whole thing is going to be equal
to the energy as a function of time.

203
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.841
Which will be cancelled by the same
term in the right hand side.

204
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:32.920
So, there's going to be
also another term here, so

205
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.080
it's going to be i h bar,
i gamma dot times psi.

206
00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:43.768
And finally there's going to be
a derivative of the wave function itself.

207
00:15:43.768 --> 00:15:49.332
So the eigen states are changing,
so the Hamiltonian is changing,

208
00:15:49.332 --> 00:15:55.676
and so do the eigen states, so therefore
there's going to be another theorem,

209
00:15:55.676 --> 00:16:00.943
so let me write it, plus i h bar,
into the power i theta + gamma,

210
00:16:00.943 --> 00:16:05.166
here we're going to have
the derivative of this guy.

211
00:16:05.166 --> 00:16:10.672
And the right hand side is e naught Times
psi, which as I already mentioned is

212
00:16:10.672 --> 00:16:15.940
going to be cancelled precisely by
the first term in the left-hand side.

213
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.960
That's why we introduced this
dynamical phase in the first place.

214
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.360
And now what remains is simply
to balance out these two terms.

215
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.590
And as you can see,
a lot of things cancel out.

216
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.780
So the Planck constant cancels out.

217
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.742
So the phase factors in this room
are going to be cancelled by

218
00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:36.320
the corresponding phase
factors in this wave function.

219
00:16:37.976 --> 00:16:41.990
So this goes away, and
I times I is equals to -1, and so

220
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.860
what we can write is the foil.

221
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.565
So, let's say in the left hand side
we're going to have a gamma dot.

222
00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:54.410
The wave function, the ground state wave
function is equal, basically to this guy,

223
00:16:54.410 --> 00:17:00.020
I G over GT 0T.

224
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.208
So, finally what we can do here,

225
00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:06.518
we can take advantage of the fact
that we have normalized states.

226
00:17:06.518 --> 00:17:09.636
So, the number of
particles is conserved and

227
00:17:09.636 --> 00:17:12.514
our particle exist In this ground state.

228
00:17:12.514 --> 00:17:17.310
Therefore, this bracket product of
this instantaneous ground state with

229
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:18.841
itself is equal to one.

230
00:17:18.841 --> 00:17:23.098
And so if we multiply this equation
from the left by Brah vector 0t,

231
00:17:23.098 --> 00:17:27.080
so we're going to have simply
one in the left-hand side.

232
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.559
And we're going to have 0t,
d over dt, 0t on the right-hand side.

233
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.050
So therefore, what we can do,
we can write the Berry phase,

234
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:40.330
well this Berry phase gamma at a time t

235
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:47.460
as an integral from 0 to capital T.

236
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.270
So this is the time that
it takes the particle,

237
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.200
well the system to return to
the original Hamiltonian.

238
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:03.860
And under this integral we are going
to have 0t, d over dt, 0t.

239
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.180
It is an integral over time.

240
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.920
So, we get this interesting term.

241
00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:13.760
Which is the Berry phase.

242
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.740
And as we shall discuss in the last slide.

243
00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.540
So this term has a very interesting
geometric interpretation.

244
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.360
That's why it's called a geometric phase.

245
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.830
To see this, let us recall the definition
of these eigen states, 0t.

246
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.360
So, those are the instantaneous
Eigen states of the Hamiltonian,

247
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.740
but per our assumption, so
the Hamiltonian depends on time

248
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.920
only through the parameter lambda,
this is the actual parameter lambda.

249
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.430
So, instead of writing this guy as
being parameterized by t, we can as

250
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:51.430
well parameterize them by this parameter
lambda, this parameter space here.

251
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.930
And If we do so,
we can transform these integral over

252
00:18:55.930 --> 00:19:01.030
time into an integral over
a lambda in this parameter space.

253
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:06.980
And this would acquire a very curious,
as I said, geometric interpretation.

254
00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.540
So, almost the last step here is to
perform a change of variables and

255
00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:15.250
to go from an integral over time
to an integral over lambda.

256
00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.260
And this can be done by simply writing.

257
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.170
So here, this d over dt can be written.

258
00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:24.010
So, this is the identity.

259
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:31.750
It can written as D lambda over dt,
d over d lambda.

260
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:32.940
Okay?

261
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:38.480
And on the other hand when this guy is
going to multiply this differential.

262
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.810
So, we can simply replace this product.

263
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.560
By, d lambda.

264
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:51.430
And so,
another way to write this Berry phase.

265
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.030
So, let me present it here.

266
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:56.960
So, gamma can be written as an integral.

267
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:03.340
And now this integral will go actually
around this loop in this parameter space.

268
00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.800
So, it's going to be a closed integral.

269
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.110
So, let's say this contour we call it c.

270
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:12.490
So, it' going to be
basically encircling the c.

271
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.735
And here we're going to have 0 lambda,

272
00:20:16.735 --> 00:20:21.410
d over d lambda, 0 lambda, d lambda.

273
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.480
Okay.

274
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.170
So, this is just another way to
write essentially the same quantity.

275
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.220
But the time is completely
gone from our description,

276
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.650
even though we started with
a time-dependent problem.

277
00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:34.418
So here, time is not essential anymore.

278
00:20:34.418 --> 00:20:38.086
So another thing we can do,
we can introduce a new notation.

279
00:20:38.086 --> 00:20:42.302
Let me call it a [INAUDIBLE],
a is the function of lambda,

280
00:20:42.302 --> 00:20:45.460
which is by definition
going to be this guy.

281
00:20:50.244 --> 00:20:57.930
And so in these notations we can see
that the at Berry phase is nothing but

282
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.940
a circulation of this
potential if you want.

283
00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.090
A of lambda around this too okay.

284
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.930
So, another thing that we can do here,

285
00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:14.140
we can take advantage of certain
identities from the vector analysis.

286
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:21.050
Hopefully familiar to some of you who have
studied the theory of vector magnetism.

287
00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.630
Namely, we can define
the curl of this vector a.

288
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:31.050
So, let's define the curl of a,
curl with this respect to this lambda.

289
00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.203
And let me call it b of lambda.

290
00:21:34.203 --> 00:21:41.991
And if we do so, this Berry phase gamma
can be rewritten as a flux of this,

291
00:21:41.991 --> 00:21:47.228
I will call it fictitious
magnetic field through

292
00:21:47.228 --> 00:21:55.425
the area enclosed by this loop that
corresponds to this quantum evolution.

293
00:21:57.582 --> 00:22:02.190
Okay so, essentially, well it's very
complicated but, so those of you who,

294
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.502
again, are familiar with the theory of
electromagnetism may remember that to

295
00:22:05.502 --> 00:22:10.372
describe magnetic fields in real
space is often times convenient

296
00:22:10.372 --> 00:22:14.552
to introduce a vector potential such
that the curl of this vector potential

297
00:22:14.552 --> 00:22:18.860
is the magnetic field.

298
00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.105
And so here, instead of the real space,
we have this sort of fictitious parameter

299
00:22:23.105 --> 00:22:26.796
space, which does not have to be real
space, it can be something else,

300
00:22:26.796 --> 00:22:29.630
can be just a set of
parameters in our problem.

301
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.330
And what we found is that the quantal

302
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:36.670
phase that will be acquired by the wave
function as a result of this evolution

303
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:41.630
Is essentially a flat of some fictitious
magnetic field that exists in this model.

304
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.390
Okay?
So by the way,

305
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:49.500
even though we started with a time
dependent problem, this b of lambda and

306
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:55.810
the corresponding deterpotential e
can be calculated by themselves.

307
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:59.210
So, if we just have a Hamiltonian,
which depends on lambda, whether or

308
00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.020
not it depends on time
is a separate matter.

309
00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:06.240
We can just go ahead and
calculate these properties.

310
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.430
And so what we may think about is that

311
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.900
when we have a quantum system which is
parameterized by some parameter lambda.

312
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.460
So there exists an internal,

313
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.350
in some sense fictitious magnetic
field in this parameter space.

314
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:24.150
And so it exists whether or
not we perform quantum evolution, but

315
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.000
if we do perform quantum evolution, and

316
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.610
if we have this sort of pejorative
time dependent perturbation.

317
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:35.380
So the quantum phases,
it will be acquired by the particle

318
00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.980
is going to be basically
the flux of this magnetic field,

319
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:44.090
if you want through this
area enclosed by this loop.

320
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.470
And that's why it's called
the geometric phase,

321
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.030
sometimes it's also
called topological phase.

322
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:52.840
It's a very nontrivial concept,
so I mean, first of all,

323
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.720
it was not discovered in the early
days of quantum mechanics.

324
00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.100
It was discovered only in the ages,
and furthermore, only now, and

325
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.550
this is basically the subject
of current research,

326
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:07.140
we are starting to understand the true
importance of this Berry phase.

327
00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.450
And one of the recent discoveries
that you might have heard about is so

328
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.000
called topological insulators.

329
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.880
So suddenly, I didn't have time to talk
about these quite amazing discoveries.

330
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:22.800
But I just wanted to mention them in
passing to sort of emphasize that this is

331
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.440
not just a pure mathematical construct,
which is sort of elegant by itself, but

332
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.360
also does have important
physical applications, and

333
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.040
this is the subject of current research.

334
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.900
So, the final thing I'm going to mention
here, sort of concluding this technical

335
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.540
discussion, is that unlike
the magnetic field, in real space

336
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.220
which does not sources or sinks, so
there are no monopoles as we know.

337
00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.130
So, the degradations of
the magnetic pool to zero.

338
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.145
So this fictitious magnetic
field actually can have sources.

339
00:24:54.145 --> 00:24:59.667
And, these sources are, well some sort
of monopoles, in this parameter space,

340
00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:03.920
to respond to the degeneracies
in the spectrum of the problem.

341
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.990
So what it actually means, and
this is one of the results,

342
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:13.170
understood by Barry in his original paper,
is that if we have some value,

343
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.560
some special values of parameter lambda,
let's say lambda star.

344
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:23.850
Such that there exist two wave
functions with the same energy.

345
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:27.740
So basically the energy levels cross so
then these points,

346
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.880
let's say this point serve as sources or

347
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.800
monopoles of this magnetic
field in this parameter space.

348
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.510
This is also a very interesting result.

349
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:42.020
Well, it's a very interesting subject.

350
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.850
I could definitely talk more about it.

351
00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:45.430
It's a very exciting field.

352
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:49.590
But I feel that I probably
should stop here,

353
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.834
because I've been talking for 25 minutes
now in this last part of the last lecture.

354
00:25:55.035 --> 00:25:58.365
And I just would like to thank
you very much for your attention.

355
00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:02.935
I hope that this lecture, and in general
the course, were interesting and useful,

356
00:26:02.935 --> 00:26:06.535
at least some parts of it,
and I wish you all the best.

357
00:26:06.535 --> 00:26:07.285
Thank you very much.
