1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:06,624
In this video I am going to talk about
perhaps the simplest kind of problem in

2
00:00:06,624 --> 00:00:12,882
time-dependent quantum mechanics, that is,
the problem of the sudden perturbations,

3
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:17,757
which happens when a potential in
a quantum problem changes very fast as

4
00:00:17,757 --> 00:00:21,846
compared to all other relevant
time scales in the problem.

5
00:00:21,846 --> 00:00:29,200
So another term for such a sudden change
in the potential is a quantum quench.

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,869
And this may happen, for instance,

7
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:38,566
if we have a potential which changes very
rapidly from one form to a different form.

8
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:43,500
So let's say here, for example,
I'm showing a harmonic oscillator, and

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,433
let's say for a negative time we have
a particle, let's say, just sitting

10
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:53,292
here on a stationary state described
by the usual Gaussian wave function,

11
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:56,455
which is the eigenfunction
of the ground state,

12
00:00:56,455 --> 00:01:00,423
the ground state wave function
of the harmonic oscillator.

13
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,925
And let's imagine at t = 0,

14
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:09,070
the frequency of the harmonic
oscillator potential changes rapidly.

15
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,910
So it increases rapidly such that
it becomes a completely different

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,350
potential now.

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,450
So what kind of questions can we ask?

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,600
Well, before asking questions,
let's see what's going on here.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,781
So the main sort of
insight in this problem is

20
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:30,414
that while the potential
changes very rapidly,

21
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:35,276
the wave function does not
have the time to change.

22
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:40,394
So the wave-function right before
the quench is exactly equal to

23
00:01:40,394 --> 00:01:45,605
the wave-function right after the quench,
in the approximation

24
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:51,204
of an infinitely fast or an infinitely
sudden quench of the potential.

25
00:01:51,204 --> 00:01:52,485
Let's say, in this case,

26
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:57,020
from one harmonic oscillator frequency to
a different harmonic oscillator frequency.

27
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,500
But another important insight is that
the quantum state that used to be a good,

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,350
stable stationary ground state is no
longer an eignestate of our potential.

29
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,490
But what is it?

30
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,259
So this wave-function,
the old wave-function,

31
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:18,690
is just some wave-function from the point
of view of the new Hamiltonian.

32
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,041
So, for instance,
let me call this guy here, psi 0 (1),

33
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:27,730
which refers to the ground state of
the old potential that we had for

34
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,762
a negative, where t is smaller than zero.

35
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:32,823
And now after we quench it, so

36
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:37,614
this psi 0 (1) is no longer
an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

37
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:42,190
Let's say we have the Hamiltonian,
H2, when it acts on psi 0 (1),

38
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:46,541
it's no longer equal to an energy
of anything times psi 0 (1), so

39
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:53,180
it's no longer proportional to psi 0 (1),
so this state is no longer an eigenstate.

40
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:00,000
What it is, though, as always, we can use
the eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,960
So we can use these
eigenstates as a basis.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,800
So what we can do,
we can expand our wave function,

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,480
which was the eigenstate of the old
Hamiltonian, in terms of the coefficient's

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,670
here, let me call it C sub n, and
n in this case goes from 0 to infinity,

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,245
in this particular case of
the harmonic oscillator.

46
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:26,060
And this can be expanded in
terms of the wave functions

47
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,980
of the new harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian.

48
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,520
But, in general,
these coefficients are all non-zero.

49
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,399
So basically what happens after we do
this quench is that the wave-function,

50
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:42,118
which used to be a nice,
pure state with a well defined energy,

51
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:46,306
well defined frequency,
now becomes, essentially,

52
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:51,053
a bunch of incoherent harmonics
with different frequencies.

53
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:55,554
If I were to suggest a possible
classical analog of what happens here,

54
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:59,980
imagine you have a guitar string and
you generated a pure frequency,

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,016
a pure sound, with the natural frequency
of the string, and then you suddenly

56
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:10,087
changed the length of the string, well,
just pinch it at a certain distance.

57
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:13,497
So then you're going to generate all kinds
of new sounds, all kinds of harmonics,

58
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:15,068
it's no longer going to be a pure sound.

59
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:19,281
A similar thing is happening here,
but instead of the sound,

60
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:24,060
instead of the strings, we are having
quantum states which become now

61
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,260
a linear combination of
the new eigenstates.

62
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,910
So an interesting illustration, perhaps,

63
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,660
of physically relevant phenomenon that
can be discussed in this context here.

64
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,240
So let's say, again,
let me go back to this original potential.

65
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,070
Let's say we have many particles
sitting in the ground state.

66
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,477
So this basically means that there is
a Bose-Einstein condensate of sorts which

67
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:55,290
are again are produced in particular in
many experimental laboratories worldwide.

68
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,710
So this is now done very frequently and
routinely.

69
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,030
So, and let me say,

70
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,570
I changed the frequency of
the trap as I just showed you.

71
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:08,450
What happens is that these particles,

72
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,540
which used to be in the ground state of
the old potential, now get redistributed

73
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,790
to, essentially,
all possible states of the new potential.

74
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,720
And after time goes by, so

75
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,700
there is some relaxation going on, and
the system relaxes to a new state, but

76
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,690
now the temperature of the state
is going to be larger.

77
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,700
The temperature is actually
essentially the measure

78
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,590
of the typical energy of
the particle in a many-body system.

79
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,570
So essentially what I"m saying here
is that any change in the potential,

80
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,130
in this case it's a harmonic oscillator,
but it's a completely general statement,

81
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,320
any sudden change of
the potential always heats it up.

82
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,330
So it doesn't matter whether
we increase the frequency or

83
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,960
decrease the frequency,
if we, let's say, had

84
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,730
the lowest energy state in the beginning
with the lowest possible temperature,

85
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,770
let's say even zero, absolute zero in
this model, if we do the quench, so

86
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,370
the particles are going to be
redistributed among all possible energies.

87
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,290
And, eventually, they're going to
relax to a final temperature,

88
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,950
which is always higher
than the original one.

89
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,830
So this is an interesting phenomenon
that we can understand without any

90
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,150
calculations, just by this discussion.

91
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,760
Now, another thing, let me just mention
in the end, so here in the context

92
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,559
of this expansion of the original
wave function in terms of the new

93
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:28,226
eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator,
or any other potential for this matter.

94
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:32,510
So these coefficients determine the
probability of us finding the particle,

95
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,570
in the single particle case, or
the density of particles, let's say,

96
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,910
in the many particle case,
in a specific new eigenstate.

97
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,233
So Cn squared is exactly
the probability of

98
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:51,502
finding our particle in the state,

99
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:56,946
psi sub n (2), which again refers

100
00:06:56,946 --> 00:07:02,215
to the potential after the quench,

101
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:08,200
well, at, oops, at t greater than 0.

102
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,468
Okay, it's not always working,
this writing on a tablet.

103
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:16,208
Now, so now let me move,
actually, to a similar but

104
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:22,160
physically quite different problem,
which also involves sudden perturbation,

105
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,340
but it's a perturbation of
a completely different type.

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:32,300
So the toy problem that we're going
to solve was actually a serious

107
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,590
research problem back 70 years ago or

108
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,750
so in the good old days
of theoretical physics.

109
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:45,671
And it was, actually, considered by a
famous Russian theorist mostly working in

110
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:48,679
nuclear physics, Arkady Migdal, in 1939.

111
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:52,824
So this problem I'm going to
discuss actually appears also

112
00:07:52,824 --> 00:07:57,143
in the Landau-Lifshitz course
on theoretical physics for

113
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,529
those of you who have
access to this material.

114
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:05,750
And well, the problem itself
is quite straightforward.

115
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,569
So to formulate the problem,
so let's say we have an atom.

116
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,363
So for the sake of simplicity,
I'll be talking about the hydrogen atom.

117
00:08:13,363 --> 00:08:18,735
But in principle we can consider any atom,
including heavy atoms for

118
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:25,230
which it's the most interesting due to
various applications in nuclear physics.

119
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,920
And let's imagine that
a nucleus of this atom,

120
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,855
which has its atomic electron or
electrons in its ground

121
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:41,130
state receives a sharp impulse
which gives it a velocity v.

122
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,633
So we kick it with the radiation or with
a hammer, or we drop it from an airplane,

123
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:47,740
or whatever you want to think about.

124
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,251
So and what we want to know is,
what's going to happen with the electron?

125
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:56,416
So basically here the sharp sudden
perturbation is that initially,

126
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,380
we have this atom at rest.

127
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,870
And at certain moment of
time let's say t equals 0,

128
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,090
this atom starts moving
with a certain velocity v.

129
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,718
And as it does so, we want to see,
we want to follow it, and

130
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,723
we want to see if
the electron gets excited.

131
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:15,900
But how do we calculate the probability
for the election to get excited?

132
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,370
That is to say that it would
go to an excited state with

133
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,610
the higher quantum number or
the atom would even get ionized.

134
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,601
That is to say that the electron
just leaves the atom and

135
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,983
goes into the continuum, and
they just go two separate ways,

136
00:09:30,983 --> 00:09:33,273
the atom of the nucleus and the electron.

137
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:37,489
So here, naively, it seems that
the potential doesn't really change,

138
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:39,400
we don't quench the potential.

139
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,575
But, if we look at this problem a little
closer, we see that, well the atom,

140
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:49,991
when it receives this impulse or
this kick, so the atom starts moving.

141
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:54,880
And the atom is the potential, which binds
the electron to it in the first place.

142
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,630
So therefore, the potential in which the
electron is supposed to be bound starts

143
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,670
moving, and so this is sharp change.

144
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,456
But the wave function of the electron
does not have time to change.

145
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:11,082
So if let's say the electron was here
in the vicinity of the lowest orbit, so

146
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:14,336
it was localized in the vicinity
of the lowest orbit,

147
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:16,240
it will just try to stay there.

148
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,706
And the question we're asking is, whether
the atom, when it starts moving with

149
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:24,330
a certain velocity, whether it
will carry the electron with it.

150
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,234
Or whether it will leave it behind or

151
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:30,426
maybe whether the electron will sort
of dissipate into higher energy states.

152
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:33,774
So and for this, to solve this problem,

153
00:10:33,774 --> 00:10:39,388
what turns out to be useful is to
go into another frame of reference,

154
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,800
which is moving together with the atom.

155
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,680
So essentially, we want just to
move together with the atom and

156
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,200
write the wave function of the electron
in this new frame of reference.

157
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,801
So, this is really the key
to solving the problem.

158
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:58,114
Because in the frame of reference
moving together with the atom,

159
00:10:58,114 --> 00:11:01,021
the potential is exactly the same.

160
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,670
The Coulomb potential to begin with
is the Coulomb potential here.

161
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,380
And in this frame of reference the atom,
the nucleus itself, is static, but

162
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,830
the electron now is moving.

163
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,173
And so essentially, what we have to do, we
have to write the electron wave function

164
00:11:15,173 --> 00:11:18,538
after the quench, after well in this case,
it's not a quench.

165
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

166
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:26,100
After this sort of jolt of the atom, and
this wave function will have two pieces.

167
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,000
So, the first piece is
going to be just this standard

168
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,500
ground state wave function of the hydrogen
atom, in the case of a hydrogen atom.

169
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,610
And there will be a piece, a new piece,

170
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,600
which is related to the velocity of
the electron moving with velocity v.

171
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,125
So here, essentially it's a plane wave.

172
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:47,799
So, a way to write the wave
function in the frame of reference

173
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,656
moving with the nucleus is to write
it as a product of a localized

174
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:56,984
wave function in the lowest
orbit times the plane wave.

175
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:57,880
And here again,

176
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,415
this mv is simply the momentum of
the electron in this frame of reference.

177
00:12:02,415 --> 00:12:06,655
And this is just the standard
plane wave expression.

178
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:11,755
So now the final step is to calculate the
excitation probability of the electron,

179
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:16,295
that is, to find the total
probability of the electron going to

180
00:12:16,295 --> 00:12:19,385
some higher energy state,
including the continuum states.

181
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:23,470
And well, the good thing is that
we know the wave function now.

182
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,860
So in this moving frame of reference,
let me just write it again.

183
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,159
So psi0 of r = 1 over
the square root of pi a cubed.

184
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,491
So this is the Bohr's radius,

185
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:40,847
e to the power -r over the Bohr radius and

186
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:46,630
times this plane wave,
e to the -i over h bar mv dot r.

187
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,876
So this is our wave
function we just derived,

188
00:12:50,876 --> 00:12:54,804
sort of, which is by logical reasoning.

189
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:59,451
And if we want to know, let's say,
what the probability of a transition into

190
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:02,827
a higher energy state is,
let's say some other state.

191
00:13:02,827 --> 00:13:09,112
I'm not going to specify what it is but
some, let's say psi sub k, whatever k is.

192
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:13,680
k could be a collection of indices,
involving the radial quantum numbers and

193
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,880
the angular quantum numbers.

194
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,140
Or it can be a label of a continuum state,
whatever this quantum label is.

195
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,395
So the amplitude, the transition amplitude

196
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:32,505
is going to be,
let me write it A of 0 to k will

197
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:38,051
be equal to the overlap
integral of this psi0.

198
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:43,455
Let me write it star,
although it doesn't really matter,

199
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:47,247
psi sub k of r integrated over the volume.

200
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:53,779
And the probability to go from this ground
state to an excited state, w sub k,

201
00:13:53,779 --> 00:14:00,630
is going to be equal to the absolute value
squared of this transition amplitude.

202
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,655
So, this is what it means.

203
00:14:02,655 --> 00:14:08,294
So another way to connect it to what I
talked about previously is to notice that

204
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:14,450
this wave function can be expanded in the
basis of all eigenstates of our problem.

205
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,270
In this case, actually it's both
the discrete states, which describe atoms,

206
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm sorry, electrons localized near
the atom, and also the continuum states.

207
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,767
Okay, and it seems that well,
the problem is very complicated, so

208
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,638
we have to sum over all
these probabilities.

209
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:35,142
Well fortunately we don't have to do so
really, so

210
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,590
this was just a necessary comment.

211
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,280
As a matter of fact, if we're
interested in calculating the total

212
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,636
excitation probability,
we may want to notice that the total

213
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:51,358
probability to find electron in
some quantum state is equal to 1.

214
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:54,800
So the electron will stay somewhere,
right, so it will be in some state.

215
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,130
So therefore, the probability to
remain in the ground state plus

216
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:05,049
the excitation probability,
which is essentially the sum in

217
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:10,140
this ungeneralized sense,
it involves an integral of this w sub k.

218
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,950
So this must be equal to 1, and

219
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,210
this excitation probability is
exactly what we're trying to find.

220
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:20,940
So from this equation, we simply can
write that this excitation probability

221
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,990
is equal to 1 minus the probability not
to get excited, the probability to remain

222
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,440
in the ground state now of the moving
atom, of the moving nucleus.

223
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,630
Well, I just realized actually,

224
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,410
that there is a slight problem
with the notations here.

225
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,150
Because what we're actually looking for
is the transition amplitudes and

226
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,730
the transition probability
from an electron,

227
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,970
that is a moving electron relative
to the stationary nucleus.

228
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,320
But we want to find transition's
amplitude into a stationary states

229
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,274
localized near this nucleus.

230
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:59,870
So therefore, these states for instance,
they do not have this plane wave piece,

231
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,863
so let me just Sort of introduce
a tilde here which would refer to

232
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:09,598
the fact that these guys
are moving together with the atom.

233
00:16:09,598 --> 00:16:14,652
While this state, psi0 that we
derived in the previous slide,

234
00:16:14,652 --> 00:16:19,160
is actually moving with velocity
v relative to the atom.

235
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,260
Now, with this correction to notations and
with this comment about the total

236
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,700
probability of staying in the new
ground state plus the probability of

237
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,930
the excitation being equal to one, we can
write down this excitation probability.

238
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,930
Let me just do that.

239
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,500
Psi-star is going to be equal
to 1 minus the probability

240
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,760
to stay in the ground state, which
means that I have to take this integral

241
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,030
of psi0 with a psi0-tilde.

242
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,005
This is the ground state of the stationary
atom integrated over the volume, and

243
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,090
square the absolute value of it.

244
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,040
And so here,
I know everything there is to know.

245
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,741
So for example,
this part here is exactly this psi0-tilde

246
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:07,500
in my new inconvenient perhaps notations.

247
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,883
So we can just plug in these functions and

248
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:16,256
integrate over volume and
I will leave this calculation to you,

249
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:22,050
so let me just maybe write an intermediate
step and the final result.

250
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,265
So the intermediate step would be simply,

251
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:30,179
would simply involve writing down
explicitly this integral, so

252
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:34,050
it's going to be 1- 1 over pi a,
Bohr radius cube.

253
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,306
So from the normalization
factor in the ground state

254
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:45,160
wave function times the exponential,
well, integral,

255
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,938
of the exponential -2r
over the Bohr radius,

256
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:54,490
minus this plane wave,
i over h-bar p dot r.

257
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,750
And so integrated over the volume,
and everything is squared.

258
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,900
So this is really the integral
that needs to be calculated.

259
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,440
Like I could take another
five minutes to go

260
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,150
over with you through
the calculation of the integral, but

261
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,150
I think it's probably not the best
use of your time and my time too.

262
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,890
So let me just leave it for those who
are interested to do it on your own.

263
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,230
And let me just write the final result.

264
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,060
So the final result will be this.

265
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,732
1-1, divided by this ratio here, 1 over 4,

266
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:28,200
m v-squared, m-squared,
v-squared, a-squared.

267
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,647
And so the Bohr radius
divided by h-bar-squared, and

268
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:33,710
everything to the fourth power.

269
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:40,040
So, I'm not necessarily saying that this
is the most important illuminating result

270
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,560
in physics, but it's result is something
we can actually measure and check.

271
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,250
So what happens if we kick an atom?

272
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,660
So what is the probability of it being
excited, and therefore it would emit

273
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,790
photons and there are all kinds of
different phenomena associated with it?

274
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,883
So and, well, one can round the various
sanity checks on this result, so

275
00:18:58,883 --> 00:19:02,646
let's say if the velocity is 0,
so we don't really kick the atom,

276
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:06,180
so it was stationary and
remains stationary, we have 1- 1.

277
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,770
So the probability to excite
the atom is exactly 0,

278
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,280
as it should be,
because we don't really do anything.

279
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,290
On the other hand, if the velocity here,
well in our non-relativistic case,

280
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,530
goes to infinity.

281
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,542
So the 1 over infinity is 0, so

282
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:23,060
the probability to excite
the atom is exactly 1.

283
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,750
So we just leave the electron behind,
that's what's going to happen,

284
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,366
the nucleus will just go away,
that's what's going to happen.

285
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:34,160
In any case, so this is just
an example that I wanted to show you,

286
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,710
it's actually two examples of this part

287
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,490
of time-dependent quantum
mechanical problems.

288
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,890
And in both these cases,
we dealt with a very sharp,

289
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,870
very sudden perturbations
to our Hamiltonian, and

290
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,440
they resulted in a redistribution
essentially of energy.

291
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,860
So the energy of the original state was,
well,

292
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,720
the original state of the old
Hamiltonian became a linear combination,

293
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,030
a rather complicated linear combination
of eigenstates of the new Hamiltonian.

294
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,155
And this is very typical for
sharp perturbations or

295
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:11,269
non-adiabatic perturbations.

296
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:15,362
Now, in the next video, we're going to
study actually the opposite case of a very

297
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:17,879
slow perturbation or
adiabatic perturbation.

298
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:22,238
Which in some sense is more interesting
in that it involves new mathematical

299
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:26,339
structures, a new phenomena,
so-called topological Berry phase.

300
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:31,027
Which is currently actually the subject
of intense research in condensed

301
00:20:31,027 --> 00:20:32,318
matter of physics.
