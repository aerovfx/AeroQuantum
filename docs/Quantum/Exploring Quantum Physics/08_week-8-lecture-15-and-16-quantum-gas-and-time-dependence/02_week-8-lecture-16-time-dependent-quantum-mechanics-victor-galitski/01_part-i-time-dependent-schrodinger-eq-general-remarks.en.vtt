00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.870
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.470
My name is Victor Gallitski, and

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.110
I gave the first eight lectures in
this course Exploring Quantum Physics.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.330
Today, it is my pleasure to welcome
those of you, who survived this course

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.909
to the last, concluding lecture
of exploring quantum physics.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.653
So this lecture is going to be on the very
interesting subject of time-dependent

7
00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:27.750
quantum mechanics, and we're going to
talk about it a little later but, first I

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.400
would like to take a couple of minutes,
to talk about the final exam coming up.

9
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.670
So, the format for the final exam,

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.269
is going to be slightly different
than that of a regular homeworks.

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.090
So, there going to be 16 problems
roughly one problem for every lecture.

12
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.479
And these problems intend to
cover all the material sort of

13
00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.950
cover that we have studied in this
course including this lecture, and

14
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.350
starting from the very first lecture.

15
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.490
So the final exam will be
due two weeks from now,

16
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.170
now being the time when we
posted these last lectures.

17
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.900
And the deadline for
the finals is going to be the same,

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.870
as the hard deadline for the last posted
homework, so we'll notice that there is no

19
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.840
homework for this last week, no regular
homework, but there is a final exam.

20
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.700
Also you will have just one attempt, to
take the final, and unlike the homeworks,

21
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.840
where we have multiple attempts.

22
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.430
And once you start,
there will be time limit of 6 hours for

23
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.700
you to complete the final.

24
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.490
But you shouldn't worry too much about it,
because the final exam should be a little

25
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.120
bit on the easier side, as compared to the
last homeworks you've seen in this course.

26
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.050
So if you've got this far,
you certainly should take the final, and

27
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.020
get your certificate, or
probably certificate with distinction,

28
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.600
I'm sure many of you will get those.

29
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.154
So in other words, if you have, so
far completed most homeworks, or

30
00:01:54.154 --> 00:01:58.471
all the homeworks, you definitely should
take the final, don't think about it.

31
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:01.513
It's going to be pretty straightforward,
and you will do well.

32
00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:07.010
Now, going to the scientific part, well to
the lecture, so I've been sort of thinking

33
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.990
a lot about a possible subject for the
last lecture, and of course there are many

34
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.230
possibilities because there is a lot of
material we haven't had the time to study.

35
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.120
Unfortunately due to the time constraints,

36
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.590
and some constraints on
the format of these lectures.

37
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.885
But I decided to talk about this subject,

38
00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:29.470
time-dependent quantum mechanics for
two reasons.

39
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.260
So the first reason is that, this topic
of time-dependent quantum mechanics is

40
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.130
among the very few topics in theoretical
physics that is still being develop.

41
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.340
So still a very active subject research
topic in a theoretical physics.

42
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.350
So this is different, by the way, from
most other things we have seen in this

43
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.350
course, where pretty much everything
we want to know, we do know.

44
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.940
So, of course people are still arguing
about foundations of quantum physics,

45
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.330
some philosophical interpretations
of quantum theory, etc.

46
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.750
So these discussions will
probably continue forever.

47
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.870
But once you accept the axioms of
quantum mechanics, and look at it from

48
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.870
the practical point of view, so we can
pretty much explain, or predict the result

49
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.790
of any considerable experiment that
can be performed with quantum systems.

50
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.450
So the problem we'll see not with
the mysteries of quantum physics,

51
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.110
but with lack of mysteries at this stage,

52
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.520
we actually understand
pretty well what we see.

53
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.350
But, this subject of
time-dependent quantum mechanics

54
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.260
is a bit different in that there
are still some open questions.

55
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.020
I wouldn't call it necessarily,
these questions are very mysterious,

56
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.760
but they're definitely open problems, and

57
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.430
frontiers which where still explore,
so this is one reason.

58
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.610
The second reason,
I have chosen this subject is because I,

59
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.210
myself have been working on it,
quite extensively for the last few years,

60
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.859
and this is among my
chief research interest.

61
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.890
So of course, what I just told you
a sort of implies that, well I hardly

62
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.660
can tell you all this interesting
things about time-dependent

63
00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.850
quantum mechanics in one lecture, so
it's a very active research topic.

64
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.730
It could be a subject of a separate
course, but at least I can sort of give

65
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.180
you a flavor, what time dependant
quantum mechanics is about, and

66
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.790
also maybe,
one message of this lecture will be for

67
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.220
you to understand why this
subject is difficult.

68
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.000
Why, unlike in most other sub
fields of quantum physics here,

69
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.720
we still sort of struggling to.

70
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.580
Understand at the technical
level what's going on,

71
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.690
so this would be another sort
of message of this lecture.

72
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.008
So what we're actually going to be
studying in today's lecture is truly,

73
00:04:50.008 --> 00:04:53.230
Time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

74
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.630
So we actually derived, well in quotes,

75
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.240
this equation in the very
first lecture of the course.

76
00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.650
But we never truly used
the time dependent part.

77
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.010
So in some sense we got rid of it the
first moment we got the opportunity to do

78
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:12.360
so, because in most cases we have
looked at sort of the potential,

79
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.970
or actually no cases, we have looked at
the potential was not time dependent,

80
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.100
the potential was a constant.

81
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.254
So what we're going to be studying today,

82
00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:28.400
is this deviation where the Hamiltonian,
H is a function explicit of time.

83
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.270
So it's not a constant,
it's a function of time.

84
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.290
So of course even, if it were not
to be a function of time, even if,

85
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.380
the Hamiltonian were a constant.

86
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.760
So the wave function would still
have been time dependent, and

87
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.080
the wave function would be.

88
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.470
We have talked a little bit
about this when we were driving

89
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.650
the feynman path integral.

90
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.810
So the wave function, as a function
of time in this case would have been

91
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.378
the evolution operator,
either the power -i over h bar.

92
00:06:00.378 --> 00:06:07.360
Ht acting on an initial condition,
the question is no.

93
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.350
Now if the Hamiltonian is
a function of time, so

94
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:18.180
this of course doesn't work,
this in this case doesn't work,

95
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.526
and basically we don't know,

96
00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:26.790
what the wave function is now, but
this is exactly what we want to know.

97
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.990
So basically, to solve
the time-dependent Schrodinger equation,

98
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.200
means either to find the wave-function,
Psi of t, explicitly.

99
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.760
Or even better,
to find the evolution operation, U of t,

100
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.312
that will relate the initial condition
to the, to the final wave-function.

101
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:52.330
So again, in the case of time independent
Hamiltonian, this evolution operator is

102
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.520
written here, so this is this exponential
[INAUDIBLE] minus I over H bar, H T,

103
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.330
but if the Hamiltonian
implicitly a function of time,

104
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.780
well there is no simple
lowest equation for this.

105
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.670
One thing I should reiterate about this
evolution operator, which is true both in

106
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.440
the case of time independent Hamiltonian,
and the case of time dependence,

107
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.230
is that actually evolution operator is
independent of the initial conditions.

108
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:29.830
So, it essentially describes a rotation of
the wave function in the Hilbert space.

109
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:31.603
So let us recall that, well,

110
00:07:31.603 --> 00:07:36.410
wave-function describes, well,
has probabilistic interpretation.

111
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.380
Okay, and so, if we take,
let's say if we just create spectrum.

112
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.890
If we have let's say one
particle in the system so,

113
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.870
the wave function must
be normalized to one.

114
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:52.457
So, and it's true both for
the initial condition, and

115
00:07:52.457 --> 00:07:54.377
for the time dependent part.

116
00:07:54.377 --> 00:07:58.647
And it should remain one, just because
if we have a single particle in our non

117
00:07:58.647 --> 00:08:03.470
relativistic quantum mechanics, it's just
going to stay there, it's not going to be.

118
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.840
It's not going to disappear and

119
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.207
new particles are not going to
appear out of the blue.

120
00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:09.996
Well actually in quantum electrodynamics,
it is possible, but

121
00:08:09.996 --> 00:08:13.000
we are doing non-relativistic
single particle quantum mechanics.

122
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.540
So this normalization
condition should be preserved.

123
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.417
And so if you think about Hilbert space,
again, as a vector space,

124
00:08:22.417 --> 00:08:24.181
let me just erase this arrow here.

125
00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:30.130
So if you think about the Hilbert space
as a vector space in which our wave

126
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.586
functions leave, so
what this condition implies in some sense,

127
00:08:35.586 --> 00:08:39.874
is that the wave function
exists on a hypersphere.

128
00:08:39.874 --> 00:08:43.147
Well again I'll draw it and
highlight it in three dimensions, but

129
00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:46.370
of course we should sort of take
this picture with a grain of salt.

130
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.820
So it's a multidimensional Hilbert space,
and

131
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.620
there is some sphere,
didn't work out very well.

132
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.250
Let me just redraw it a little better.

133
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.230
So if we have a sphere, well,
that's not much better.

134
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.940
But anyways,
you understand what I'm saying.

135
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.720
So this sphere is essentially
a manifestation of this condition.

136
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.970
It basically means that
my wave function exists,

137
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.310
the normalization condition is preserved.

138
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.260
So this essentially means
psi squared is equal to 1.

139
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.680
And if I start from some initial
condition on this sphere, so

140
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.300
let's say this is my psi 0, and

141
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.170
the only thing which can happen with this
psi 0 is that it can sort of rotate in

142
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:32.960
this Hilbert space to a new psi
of t somewhere else on this here.

143
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:40.084
And the operator u essentially enforces
this rotation from psi not to psi of t.

144
00:09:40.084 --> 00:09:42.916
So we already discussed
this as a matter of fact,

145
00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:47.132
during the derivation of the Pythagorean
integral, but it was a month,

146
00:09:47.132 --> 00:09:50.672
it was in the middle of this
optional technical innovation.

147
00:09:50.672 --> 00:09:55.055
I'm not sure if all of you have looked
at it but I think it's a very important

148
00:09:55.055 --> 00:10:00.138
message that actually u of t retains
the initial condition essentially by some

149
00:10:00.138 --> 00:10:04.663
in this multidimensional Hilbert space
to a new time dependent wave function

150
00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:08.770
somewhere in this hyper sphere
which is due to this normalization.

151
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:13.690
And the important this is that if we were
to choose let's say a different initial

152
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:20.000
condition somewhere, well, let's say
here on the sphere and we were to

153
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.040
apply the same time dependent Hamiltonian
or time independent Hamiltonian.

154
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.480
So in both cases, so
the rotation would be sorted by the same.

155
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.590
It would be different,

156
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.210
let's say psi naught prime and
the side prime of t, okay?

157
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:38.360
But the evolution operator,
this guy would be exactly the same, okay?

158
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.540
And so that's why I say, even better.

159
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.400
So of course we want to find in
a particular case when we're dealing with

160
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.570
a wave function, so we want to find
the wave function is a function of time,

161
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.430
because it will essentially describe
everything we want to know about

162
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.170
the system, or the probabilities, or

163
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.040
the transitions between various states and
amplitudes.

164
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.050
But if we know the evolution operator,

165
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:06.300
we in some sense can solve all possible
initial conditions in one shot.

166
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.800
Just because the evolution operator is
going to enforce this quantum evolution

167
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.760
just by acting on an initial condition.

168
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.620
But well, the problem with it as I
mentioned is that it's very hard

169
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.800
to find the evolution operator.

170
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.970
Now, why is that?

171
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.870
Why is it so difficult?

172
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:25.700
So let me sort of give you a very
brief explanation why it's difficult.

173
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.737
So if you look at this expression,
this equation, and if for a second, so

174
00:11:30.737 --> 00:11:35.856
let me just write it here in quotes,
in some sense this initial condition,

175
00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:40.733
for a second we assume that the
Hamiltonian is not really an operation,

176
00:11:40.733 --> 00:11:44.016
but just some function h of t,
without the hat.

177
00:11:44.016 --> 00:11:46.812
So then I can simply divide this equation,

178
00:11:46.812 --> 00:11:49.926
let me put it in quotes
because this is not true.

179
00:11:49.926 --> 00:11:55.014
So if we divide by psi of t and
integrate both sides of this equation,

180
00:11:55.014 --> 00:12:00.996
over time, we can write the solution
to this, sort of Schroedinger equation,

181
00:12:00.996 --> 00:12:05.909
dumbed down version of the Schroedinger
equation as e to the power

182
00:12:05.909 --> 00:12:10.729
minus I over h bar, and then go from
zero to t [INAUDIBLE] dt prime,

183
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:17.040
let's say these are prime, and here's
going to be the initial condition sign up.

184
00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:21.435
So this would be solution to
an ordinary differential equation,

185
00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:23.930
times the differential
equation of the first order.

186
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.360
So if you look at it, that's what it is,
it seems to be very simple, so

187
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.110
why don't we just write that and
put a hat here?

188
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.540
So it turns out that we cannot do that.

189
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:36.200
And well those of you who
are interested should take the time and

190
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.930
stare at this expression for

191
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.340
a little while and work with it
a little bit to see why it is the case.

192
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.940
Well why it is not the case actually.

193
00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.680
Why this is not true that

194
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.370
in the case of a true operator Schrodinger
equation so this solution doesn't work.

195
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.720
And the chief reason for
that is because the Hamiltonian, h of t,

196
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.510
does not commute with itself necessarily
at different moments of times.

197
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.870
So if we take two different moments
of time, let's say h of t1 and

198
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.910
h of t2, so the Hamiltonian
is not going to be the nature

199
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:15.100
of itself a different
moments of time is not zero.

200
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.610
And this is a major,
major complication which makes all quantum

201
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:24.100
mechanical time extremely difficult and
this even involves even

202
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.860
the simplest versions of these problem,
let's say with two level systems.

203
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.160
Even there, there is no, generally,

204
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.100
no closed solution to
a time dependent problem.

205
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.900
So let me just leave it here.

206
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.970
So now let me provide
a couple of general examples

207
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.300
of time-dependent quantum problems.

208
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.480
So the first example
will be the following.

209
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:52.880
So let's imagine we have a particle
which is moving in a potential of.

210
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.347
So we just draw a for

211
00:13:54.347 --> 00:13:58.020
the purpose of illustration let me
just assume it's one dimensional.

212
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.180
And let's imagine that this potential
itself is sort of breathing.

213
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.340
So it's moving as a function of time for
example or

214
00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.950
it's changing as a function of time.

215
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:08.940
And as time goes by let's
say it may become different.

216
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.000
And so the question that one may ask
is what happens with the particle,

217
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.110
the quantum particle
moving in this potential?

218
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.460
How does this wave function
change as a function of time?

219
00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:27.270
So even if the potential were constant,
so we know that strictly speaking, rather

220
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:33.480
non trivial problem to figure out the
energy levels in this quantum potential.

221
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.195
And at any moment of time,
we can define sort of an equivalent time,

222
00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:42.750
a dependent problem and
find the corresponding energy levels, but

223
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:47.440
if the Hamiltonian is time dependent,
the energy itself is not construed,

224
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.650
so this would be a wrong
question to ask in some sense.

225
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.530
What are the energy levels in the problem?

226
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:58.180
So we know at any moment of time there
is formally a time independent sort

227
00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:03.180
of eigen value problem, but unless the
potential is changing in time very slowly,

228
00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:05.260
these energy levels do not have a meaning.

229
00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.910
Because we're always sort of pumping
in energy in this system and

230
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:14.150
the energy is not construct, so this is
really one of the major complications.

231
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.090
But the probabilistic interpretation
of the wave function is still valid and

232
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.630
we can still ask the questions about.

233
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.050
Well, the probability of let's say finding
a particle in a certain region in space.

234
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.770
And it's still going to be given.

235
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.990
So this probability is
still going to be given.

236
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.057
So let me just write it here.

237
00:15:32.057 --> 00:15:37.669
This is an example of probability,
let's say to find a particle between

238
00:15:37.669 --> 00:15:43.097
points x1 and x2, is going to be given,
well it's a function of time,

239
00:15:43.097 --> 00:15:48.157
so let me write it down here,
is going to be equal to the integral from

240
00:15:48.157 --> 00:15:53.309
x1 to x2 sin(x,t) everything
squared integrated over dx, so

241
00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:59.013
this is an example of a physical
observable property that we can calculate

242
00:15:59.013 --> 00:16:04.648
using a solution to the Schroedinger
equation if this solution is null.

243
00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:06.651
Now the second kind of problem, well,

244
00:16:06.651 --> 00:16:09.820
essentially the same time-dependent
[INAUDIBLE] equation.

245
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.690
But for a different type of
a system is let's say spin in

246
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.100
a time-dependent magnetic field.

247
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:22.370
So this relates to the lectures of
Professor Epelbaum who introduced spin.

248
00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:27.120
And in particular, he was talking
about nuclear magnetic resonance,

249
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.775
MRI imaging for example.

250
00:16:28.775 --> 00:16:32.075
So where actually what's being done
is that the spin is being rotated by

251
00:16:32.075 --> 00:16:33.290
time-dependent field.

252
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.950
So and in this case the Hamiltonian well,

253
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.970
the way function first of all
is a two component spinner.

254
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.820
And the Hamiltonian here,
so this is our H of t.

255
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.120
So in this case,
the Hamiltonian simply be that sigma,

256
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.840
sigma being the vector of polymatrices.

257
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.220
And this Hamiltonian two by two matrix
acts on these two components spin.

258
00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.740
And essentially this is first
order differential equation and

259
00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:03.780
the problem here would be let's
say to find this side of t again.

260
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.900
And in this case for example,

261
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:11.950
the absolute value squared of this
psi [INAUDIBLE] of t squared.

262
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.941
This would give us
the probability of finding

263
00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:18.648
the spin in the state up at
the moment of time it's used.

264
00:17:18.648 --> 00:17:23.310
So this would be another observable
characteristic we can talk about.

265
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.950
Now an amazing thing actually and
I have to admit,

266
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.750
I didn't know it until
just a few years ago.

267
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.690
Is that this equation is actually well,
it's two by two matrix time-dependent

268
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:35.830
differential equation for
two by two matrix.

269
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.358
So this equation appears not to be
solvable in elementary functions,

270
00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:42.719
you cannot solve this equation in
general analytically at least.

271
00:17:42.719 --> 00:17:46.412
And so when I first looked at the base
equation, I thought well, I was just,

272
00:17:46.412 --> 00:17:47.870
saw it during my lunch break.

273
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.740
I didn't even want to
look into the textbooks,

274
00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:51.750
I just thought it was
a toy model of some sort.

275
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.382
But it turns out that even this equation,

276
00:17:54.382 --> 00:17:58.740
maybe the simplest quantum
mechanical problem we can think of.

277
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:05.290
Two by two matrix or
two dimensional complex Hilbert space,

278
00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.000
even this problem is not exactly
solvable for a general H of t.

279
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.805
So this gives you something well,

280
00:18:10.805 --> 00:18:14.210
some sort of insight into
the complexity of the subject.

281
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.190
But as usual in theoretical physics,
if we can't solve the problem exactly,

282
00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:23.560
it doesn't stop us from solving
it by some approximation methods.

283
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:29.470
I should mention that one major omission
in this course was perturbation theory.

284
00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:32.590
Which is a general theory of

285
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.190
solving approximately various
stationary quantum problems.

286
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.320
We didn't talk about it, but it's a very,
very important piece of quantum mechanics.

287
00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:45.080
Those of you who are interested in
professionally pursuing physics,

288
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.630
you should definitely
look into this subject.

289
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.250
But in this context and

290
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.590
the context of non-equilibrium or
time-dependent quantum mechanics.

291
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:58.350
There exists similar methods and
various approximation schemes and

292
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.240
there are two clear situations.

293
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:06.650
Two clear sort of asymptotically
opposite cases of either very fast

294
00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.210
perturbations or very slow perturbations,
or so-called adiabatic perturbations.

295
00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.020
So let me just write it down.

296
00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:17.001
And so we're going to study
actually in the next lecture,

297
00:19:17.001 --> 00:19:23.639
we're going to study fast or
sudden Perturbations,

298
00:19:23.639 --> 00:19:28.670
which means fast changes in the potential.

299
00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:33.820
And in the third part
of this lecture we're

300
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:39.839
going to discuss slow or
adiabatic perturbations.

301
00:19:43.128 --> 00:19:47.786
Which lead to very interesting
so-called topological quantum

302
00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:52.631
phase that appears in this solution
to the Schrodinger equation.

303
00:19:52.631 --> 00:19:56.652
So just sort of to wrap up
this first introductory part,

304
00:19:56.652 --> 00:20:00.858
let me first define what we
actually mean by fast and slow.

305
00:20:00.858 --> 00:20:05.041
So as we discussed throughout
the course actually, well,

306
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:10.061
if you are talking about physically
a quantity which has a non-trivial

307
00:20:10.061 --> 00:20:14.259
physical dimension,
be it the length or time or whatever.

308
00:20:14.259 --> 00:20:18.165
So you can't really say that it's small or
large unless you compare it with

309
00:20:18.165 --> 00:20:21.431
a quantity which has
the same physical dimension.

310
00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:26.161
So when we have a time scale,
let me call it for instance,

311
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:30.415
a tau of a certain
time-dependent perturbation.

312
00:20:30.415 --> 00:20:34.940
Let's say this is a typical time
at which the potential changes.

313
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:41.730
In order for us to see, to define whether
it's short time scale or long time scale.

314
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.642
We have to get another
quantity to compare with,

315
00:20:44.642 --> 00:20:46.730
which has the same physical dimension.

316
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:51.105
And it turns out that in the case of
quantum problems if you have a spectrum,

317
00:20:51.105 --> 00:20:52.916
so lets say this is our energy.

318
00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:56.090
Okay, so
let's say these are different energies.

319
00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:04.060
And there are some level spacing between
the neighboring, let's see energy levels.

320
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.742
What's in the harmonic oscillator keys,
it would be H omega in the case of

321
00:21:08.742 --> 00:21:14.040
potential wealth will be something else
and they will in general change with time.

322
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.610
So let's see if we have a system which
is quantum particle which is let's say

323
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.310
sitting on a certain quantum level and
neighboring levels.

324
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:27.250
So the appropriate energy scale associated
with it is this delta, this level spacing.

325
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:32.870
And h over delta is another time scale.

326
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:38.120
So this is a time scale to compare
with when we are talking about fast or

327
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.124
slow perturbations.

328
00:21:39.124 --> 00:21:45.080
So if tau, so if tau is much smaller

329
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.510
than h over delta, we will say that
this is a fast or sudden perturbation.

330
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:55.250
If on the other hand, tau is much
longer than h over level spacing,

331
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.990
we're going to be talking about slow or
adiabatic perturbations.

332
00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.830
And these are going to be, the fast and
slow perturbations again are going to be

333
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.840
subjects of the next two
parts of this lecture.

334
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.250
Now just the final thing I'm going to
say here is that those of you who

335
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:15.440
are interested in research on this
sort of quantum dynamical systems.

336
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:22.360
And in sort of exact non perturbative
methods of solving quantum problems.

337
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.340
So I gave a lecture, well,
it's a research level presentation but

338
00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.890
I think it should be
understandable to most of you.

339
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.280
So I gave a lecture on this
subject at the Kavli Institute for

340
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.840
Theoretical Physics a couple of years ago.

341
00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.870
And so if you are interested,
you may want to take a look at it.

342
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.980
Of course, there are a lot of
other people working on this and

343
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.140
they have a number of amazing results.

344
00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:42.590
But I think there is an interesting
development in this field

345
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.680
which allows us to
construct exact solutions.

346
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.896
But unfortunately, it's well beyond
sort of the scope of this course and

347
00:22:48.896 --> 00:22:50.396
the level of this course.

348
00:22:50.396 --> 00:22:52.856
So I'll just put a link here, so
if you're interested, take a look.

349
00:22:52.856 --> 00:22:57.979
Otherwise, we will talk now about the
sudden and slow perturbations and see how

350
00:22:57.979 --> 00:23:03.350
quantum problems can be solved in these
cases and what new phenomena appear there.
