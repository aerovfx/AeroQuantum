00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:05,610
Hello everyone, welcome back to exploring
quantum physics, I'm Charles Clark.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,350
In this part,

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:11,070
we're going to look at the experimental
development of Bose-Einstein condensation.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,180
As you saw in the previous lecture,
the theory of BEC

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,460
was developed in 1924, and it more less
likely dormant for about 70 years and

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,800
then explosive phase of growth
which is still continuing.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,930
70 years after Einstein first proposed
Bose-Einstein condensation on ideal gas,

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,600
it was finally observed quite
decisively in experiments.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,960
And that's led to a real revolution in
atomic and condensed matter physics.

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,600
So the first production of Bose-Einstein
condensate in a laboratory was done

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,510
in 1995 at JILA, the joint institute
of the University of Colorado and

12
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,378
the National Institute of Science and
Technology.

13
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,680
And the key enabling technology for

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,170
this work,
was the development of cooling and

15
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,860
trapping of atoms that first came
on the scene in the early 1980s.

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,320
This has made it possible to get to much
lower temperatures and has been obtained

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,690
in any other material system now down into
the picokelvin machine in some cases.

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,274
And the decisive evidence for

19
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:30,570
Bose-Einstein condensation that
was presented then is a picture of

20
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,550
the clouds of a rubidium
gas after its release

21
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,200
from atomic trap at three
different temperatures.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,460
Now, we'll discuss in a moment how
these temperatures are determined but

23
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,380
what you see are three images
taken at different temperatures.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,720
Going temperatures decreasing
from one frame to the next and

25
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,420
you see a distinctive change in
the density profile of this release cloud.

26
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,170
It's more or less a spherical
cloud at the high temperature and

27
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,760
then a sharp and asymmetric peak
develops as the temperature is lowered.

28
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:15,620
A very good, accessible account of this
work is given in the additional materials,

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,110
written by Eric Cornell, who's, one of
the co-authors of the original experiment.

30
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,680
Let me say something about these
images that you're looking at,

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,200
just to try to make them clearer.

32
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,240
It may take a while to
understand their implications.

33
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,320
These are just simple shadow
grams you might say of

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,040
the atomic density in the expanded clouds.

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,920
So there's a small cloud of atoms here.

36
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,290
Light is incident from the left and
then it's imaged by a microscope which

37
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,960
can scan in the horizontal direction there
and so acquire an image of the density.

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,220
It's just determined by the absorption
of the light by the gas.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,330
So what you're seeing is
the integrated density

40
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,820
of the gas in the line of the light.

41
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,000
And the coloring here is just
artificial which is put in

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,690
to enhance the visual contrast of
the image, it's just proportional.

43
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,854
It's just a look up table that
reflect the density of the atoms.

44
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:25,710
So, this asymmetry is a very
interesting aspect of

45
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,480
the formation of the quantum gas.

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,580
And if you return to thinking
about classical mechanics,

47
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,440
classical statistical mechanics,
there is is this universal

48
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,020
accounting of states for momentum that's
independent of the trapping potential.

49
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,810
And that has the following implication
that if you have a trap of arbitrary shape

50
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,980
with gas held in it and

51
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,660
then you turn off the trap,
the expanding cloud

52
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,050
eventually becomes spherical completely
independent of the shape of the trap.

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,280
Now for a quantum gas on the other hand,
position and momentum don't commute.

54
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,890
And if you have an asymmetric trap,
when you turn it off,

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,690
the cloud changes the aspect
ratio of asymmetry.

56
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:29,230
In other words, the most tightly
bound part of the gas, because of

57
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:35,030
the uncertainty relation, has the higher
momentum so it expands more rapidly.

58
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,175
There is an analogy of this in optics,

59
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:45,960
and that,
I'll just state it briefly as follows.

60
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,724
If you have an aperture of arbitrary
shape, here's a strangely shaped aperture,

61
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:54,193
and it's being illuminated by
light from a thermal source,

62
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:55,908
an incoherent light source.

63
00:04:55,908 --> 00:05:00,171
And then if you view that
light on a distant screen,

64
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:04,931
what you'll see is a circularly
symmetric image which is

65
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:09,310
independent of the shape
of the original aperture.

66
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,090
And you might think about
this in the same way

67
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,670
as the rays coming from
the various part of the aperture.

68
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,430
Just travel at a common speed, and so

69
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,860
they scatter onto the screen at far
distances without retaining any memory

70
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,250
of the particular part of
the aperture from which they came.

71
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,270
For radiation from a coherent source,
on the other hand,

72
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,770
like a laser where all the photons
have the same frequency on

73
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,001
the same directionality,
the common mode structure,

74
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:49,242
then you get a result similar to what
we just mentioned for the gases.

75
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:54,987
So if you have coherent radiation
incident on a circular aperture,

76
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:59,080
well then the far field image is circular.

77
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,130
But, if you have the coherent light
going through an asymmetric aperture

78
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,210
then the far field image reverses the
aspect ratio just as in the case of a gas,

79
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,690
that's for very similar reasons.

80
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,867
So, the inversion of the aspect ratio
as well as a very distinctive density

81
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:21,211
profile is a very strong sign that
you're producing coherent matter waves,

82
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:26,082
that is all atoms are in the same
quantum state and with a common phase.

83
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:33,629
This is illustrated even more
dramatically when one looks at

84
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,340
atoms in optical lattices.

85
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,550
And we'll say something about,

86
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,120
more about optical lattices in
the later part of this lecture.

87
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,060
But you can think of it, for the moment,

88
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,960
it's a just a set of standing light waves
and they form a periodic structure,

89
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,990
not that well represented by my scribbling
here which forms an array of sites.

90
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,680
Just like the sites of a crystal,
atoms in a crystal, and

91
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,170
that can be use as a trap to
form sort of a synthetic lattice

92
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,450
of atoms that are held in
a regular array by light forces.

93
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:19,180
So when you have a non-condensed gas in
such a trap and you turn the trap off.

94
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,797
Then what you see is spherical
expansion with a little bit of memory

95
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:27,270
retention of the underlying
lattice structure.

96
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,205
But here is an actual observation
such as system consisting about

97
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:36,162
150,000 rubidium atoms in a cubic lattice.

98
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:41,022
So you're seeing a line of sight
image showing a spherical expansion

99
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:42,040
of the cloud.

100
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,228
Well, if you go into Bose-Einstein

101
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:54,810
condensate phase where all
the atoms in the lattice

102
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,870
have a common phase, then the expansion
image is radically different.

103
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,570
You can see that the gas
expands really indiscrete

104
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,530
directions that carry the underlying
symmetry of the lattice.

105
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,960
This is really an analog of brag
defraction of x-rays or flight.

106
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,100
And this is not just a fluke,

107
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,680
the last of these images is
the one that's most amazing to me.

108
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,920
And it actually shows that
when you turn off the trap

109
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,830
the cloud falls under
the influence of gravity,

110
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,930
as you would expect, and
that this cubic expansion,

111
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:39,210
this highly ordered expansion phase is
not just a fluke, it continues forever.

112
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,930
So that's a powerful demonstration,

113
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,820
of the production of coherence
in the matter waves.

114
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,870
How do we understand in detail the
dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensate?

115
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:56,650
Well it turns out there's a very useful
framework, originally developed for

116
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,680
the study of liquid helium.

117
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,990
Where it wasn't really that successful
because liquid helium is a strongly

118
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:03,680
interacting system.

119
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,960
But it has proven to be of incredibly
valuable use in understanding

120
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,620
the dilute Bose-Einstein condensates
that are produced in the lab today.

121
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,510
And let me emphasize,

122
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,680
these gases that show this remarkable
quantum behavior are very dilute.

123
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,070
They have a density about
100,000th that of air, yet

124
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,120
they showed that remarkable
collective phenomenon.

125
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,210
So this equation describes a framework
in which all the atoms in the gas

126
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,300
are said to be characterized to be
of the same wave function psi or

127
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,860
orbital psi you may call it.

128
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,980
The interaction between the atoms is
the two body interaction between a given

129
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,470
pair of atoms is represented by
a direct delta pseudo potential.

130
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,130
The type was discussed in
a previous lecture characterized by

131
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:58,260
the scattering length which is a proxy for

132
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:05,039
the full two body interaction potential in
a limited energy range near zero energy.

133
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:12,680
So called scattered length,
on that is a parameter which is determined

134
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,295
by independent experimental measurements
of the atomic collision physics.

135
00:10:16,295 --> 00:10:20,370
And I emphasize that, in modern work,

136
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,280
there are no adjustable parameters in the
description of a Bose-Einstein condensate.

137
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,550
Everything is determined,
some cases by great accuracy,

138
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,000
by independent types of measurements.

139
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,700
So the time evolution of
the wave function is given by

140
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,180
a variation on the Schrodinger equation.

141
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,840
The first part of which
you should recognize as

142
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,630
the usual single particle
Schroedinger equation that we've

143
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,330
discussed at length in
previous parts of this course.

144
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,150
And then the new element
is this nonlinear term

145
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,740
which reflects the influence of
the interaction between atoms so

146
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,200
it's proportional to the number of
atoms to the scattering length and

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,200
then it has a cubic nonlinearity and
the wave function and this gives rise to

148
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,627
typo dynamic that just not seen at all
in the ordinary Schrodinger equation.

149
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,174
Here's an example of
the generation of soliton in

150
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:27,290
a Bose-Einstein condensate by
the use of optical phase imprinting.

151
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,030
And the way the experiment is done
is that there's a cloud of gas in

152
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:39,370
the Bose-Einstein condensate, then it's
illuminated by near resonant light,

153
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:46,550
and there's a mask that shadows half
the condensate from the light and

154
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,660
the part that's illuminated
acquires a phase shift

155
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,920
which is just due to the ac-Stark effect
of the light, the light shift potential.

156
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,662
And then one looks at the evolution
of the condensate after that.

157
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:09,720
Which is shown here,
an experiment done the year 2000.

158
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,080
This shows the cloud of
the gas at a sequence of

159
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,620
time intervals after this imprinting
of the optical phase and what

160
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,770
you see is the development of a density
notch which propagates along the cloud.

161
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,968
This is actually a matter-wave soliton.

162
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:33,134
The top row of the images
are experimental measurements and

163
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:37,885
the bottom are calculations using
the Gross–Pitaevskii equation

164
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:40,478
with the experimental parameters.

165
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:49,215
Here's some more recent
work that just shows how

166
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:57,440
we can generate arbitrary angular
momentum states in the ring-shaped traps.

167
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,340
Prefers experimental

168
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,090
work done by my colleagues at the National
Institute Science and Technology.

169
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,980
And so it uses an optical trap which is

170
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:14,110
schematized in this frame,
it consist of a supporting light sheet and

171
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,070
then a ring that's created from
symmetric being with a core in it.

172
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,630
And this creates a confining potential
that's of a toroidal shape indicated here.

173
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,530
And then another beam is introduced
that is sort of like a paddle.

174
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,370
It's a light sheet that
cuts through the Taurus

175
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,630
just like you might cut through
a donut with a knife and

176
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:41,750
then that paddle can be rotated
around to stir the condensate up.

177
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,340
And so you see images here
in this lower frame of how

178
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,170
the cloud of atoms is moved
by the action of this paddle.

179
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,910
So the general characteristics of these
experiments is about half a million sodium

180
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:08,090
atoms in this ring trap, toroidal trap the
radius of this trap is about 20 microns.

181
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,800
So one starts with a nice
quiet ground state

182
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,740
of the condensate stirs it up and
then releases and measures, the density.

183
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,460
And what is seen there,
here's the experimental data.

184
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,510
These again are these absorption images.

185
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,510
It's a sort of the most common way of
viewing Bose-Einstein condensates.

186
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:37,440
These are labeled after the fact by
the values of the angular momentum.

187
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,625
We have a donut here and
there is a conserve angular momentum

188
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:47,220
LZ along the axis perpendicular
to the plane of the donut.

189
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,550
And depending on the stirring conditions
one can generate the successive

190
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,530
values of the quantized angular momentum.

191
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,720
There will be a problem in the final
exam that deals with this and

192
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,910
just to give a hint ahead of time,
you could think about how these angular

193
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,530
momentum could be generated by thinking
along the lines of the bohr model.

194
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,060
In other words, we're going to
stir the atoms with a paddle and

195
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,860
promote them to states of
higher angular momentum.

196
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,240
So you can think about,

197
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,270
well, if the angular momentum is
quantized as proposed by Bohr.

198
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:33,220
That is the integer multiple
of Planck's constant,

199
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:38,220
what does that imply about the rotation
frequency of the paddle that

200
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,670
you need to tune to in order
to get that quantized result?

201
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,280
And here is a you might say
the smoking gun for quantization.

202
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,820
These two frames look
at the distribution of

203
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,000
whole sizes that are seen
in various experiments.

204
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,430
The upper frame and the lower,
they represent two modes of release of

205
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,470
the condensate, one of which turns out
to give a more regular set of images.

206
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,620
But what can see is that the whole
sizes come in these quantized groups

207
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,600
which are attributed to the generation of
different values in the angle momentum.

208
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,150
And the use of the Gross–Pitaevskii
equation with the parameters

209
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,590
appropriate to the experiment shows
that there's a relatively good agreement

210
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,520
with some deviation for the various
angle momentum states that observe.

211
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,120
So this frames show images of
the experimental data which is

212
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,980
indicated by the red lines with the
results of theoretical calculations for

213
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,120
different values of the angular momentum.

214
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,610
And they show that the whole size
Increases with angular momentum.

215
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,394
This is a reflection of the sort of
repulsive centrifugal potential that we

216
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:52,828
found in the discussion of angular
momentum in an earlier lecture.

217
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:01,725
So finally, I'll mention some more
recent work with this stirring

218
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:06,068
procedure in which the phenomena
of hysteresis is found.

219
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:11,134
So this experiment reported
in nature early 2014,

220
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:14,799
involves stirring and condensate up and

221
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,520
then stirring it back to
return to the original state.

222
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,545
And it has found that there is
an asymmetry in the stirring and

223
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,860
de-stirring procedure.

224
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,336
Much of is seen In classical magnetism,

225
00:17:29,336 --> 00:17:34,270
the magnetic induced is
a function of applied field.

226
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,117
And this is a theme that's pursued
in this work is often referred to

227
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:48,258
as atomtronics which has a goal
of using coherent matter waves to

228
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:53,848
implement functionality such
as one has in electronics.

229
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:58,842
That is to make circuits which use
atoms rather than electrons as

230
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:03,281
a carrier of information, and
of mass, and of spin, and

231
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:09,664
to explore the possibilities that are
available there that would perhaps someday

232
00:18:09,664 --> 00:18:15,140
complement conventional electronics for
new functional purposes.

233
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:21,250
So I'll just conclude by
mention of some accessible

234
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,840
reviews that will show you examples
of things that can be done.

235
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:31,600
Open source of these articles
is all found on the archives.

236
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,010
And these are also good references

237
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:39,740
to search against them on Google Scholar
to find examples of more recent work.

238
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,240
I think you'll see it's
a very vibrant field.
