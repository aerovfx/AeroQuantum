00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.800
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.030
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.850
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.880
In this part, we're going to look at
the properties of Fermi-Dirac particles.

5
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.143
This is a subject that is the foundation
of chemistry and materials physics,

6
00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:18.250
has been known as such for a long time.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.860
But only in the past decade or so has it
become possible to explore it directly

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.450
with great controllability and
observability in gaseous systems, and

9
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.590
that's led to a number of
exciting new developments.

10
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.690
Now we're going to look at the other part
of the world, the fermion sector, and

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.520
what happens as Fermi gases get cold.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.520
This investigation was started by Fermi
just a year or so after Einstein thought

13
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.242
of his theory of the ideal gas, and
Fermi took a very similar approach.

14
00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:57.680
Start with an ideal gas, then construct
the quantum states of motion.

15
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.470
But now, the big difference from
Einstein's theory is that Fermi suggested

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.100
that one look at an alternative quantum
hypothesis from many particle systems,

17
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.970
which is that no more than one
atom can occupy any given state.

18
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.910
This is now the prescription for
what we call Fermi-Dirac statistics,

19
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.230
and the particles that obey
the statistics are fermions, the electron,

20
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.860
the proton, the neutron.

21
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.523
In fact, ordinary matter is made up of
fermions if you have pairs of fermions

22
00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:37.653
that are boson, but nevertheless,
the fundamental particles that

23
00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:42.969
are most important for our lives
with massive particles are fermions.

24
00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:50.329
And then he calculated the properties
of gas in thermal equilibrium.

25
00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:55.012
In particular,
Fermi used the construction,

26
00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:59.490
which is rather different to what
you find in modern textbooks.

27
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.430
He takes the atoms and

28
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.740
puts them in a three dimensional
harmonic oscillator potential.

29
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.500
His original paper in English translation
to be found in additional materials,

30
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.940
it's very short, very beautifully written,
and anyone can benefit from looking at it.

31
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.280
Anyway, this hypothesis that no more than
one atom can occupy a given quantum state

32
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.780
thereby results in a very different low
temperature limit than we have for bosons.

33
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.930
So for bosons, we have Bose–Einstein
condensation, and all atoms go

34
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.730
into the ground state of the system when
the quantum degeneracy regime is attained.

35
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.520
That is when the phase based
density is greater than 1.

36
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.790
For fermions on the other hand, so now,

37
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.060
this diagram taken from
Marcus Griner is a cartoon

38
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.730
of what happens for the system of fermions
with two spin states, one up and one down.

39
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.770
The way Fermi treated it,

40
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.990
you just consider one of
these families as a fermion.

41
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.350
Let's say the spin one, spin up.

42
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.540
So if you take the spin up, if you have
spin up particles, then you have to

43
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.480
load up all the levels of the trap until
you exhaust the number of particles.

44
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.270
And that means that the zero temperature
state has a very high total energy.

45
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.980
So, as you approach zero
temperature from above,

46
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.550
what happens is you form
this hard wall of fermions.

47
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.722
And you can't make the system any
colder by removing the energetic atoms

48
00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:46.576
because the zero temperature state
has all these levels occupied.

49
00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:54.110
There are so many important
implications of Fermi's idea.

50
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.405
I mean, basically all of chemistry depends
upon what's called the Pauli exclusion

51
00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:04.500
principle, which is that you
can only have one electron per

52
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.560
quantum state or two per quantum
state if you have both spins.

53
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.090
One of the most astonishing things for me
is this limit named after Chandrasekhar.

54
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.085
It is a stunningly beautiful equation.

55
00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:27.018
You can read more about it
in Chandrasekhar's paper,

56
00:04:27.018 --> 00:04:29.460
which is included in additional materials.

57
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.180
The paper's not about this limit, but
our narrative has something about it.

58
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.890
This is a wonderful equation because
it incorporates the Planck constant

59
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.830
with the stance for quantum mechanics,
the speed of light,

60
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.560
which is relativity, and the gravitational
constant, which is gravity.

61
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.360
This is, if you remember, Victor's diagram

62
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.980
of the different dimensions of physical
theory covered in this first lecture.

63
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.620
This has got something
from each one of them.

64
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.440
And what it is,
it expresses the maximum mass

65
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.760
that a star can have and still be stable.

66
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.550
And when this was first published
in the scientific literature, and

67
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.210
I think Chandrasekhar was 19 years old
when he wrote this expression out,

68
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.090
it shocked the astronomy
community because it implied that

69
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.650
there would be run away collapse,
an existence of black holes.

70
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.223
Because you can always add more matter
to the star just by stellar collision or

71
00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:38.305
something, gravitational
attraction will enable you to

72
00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:42.250
load as much matter onto
a star as you possibly can.

73
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.710
But Chandrasekhar showed that with
the Fermi statistics that provide

74
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.675
the support against gravity,

75
00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:53.676
there's a critical mass beyond which
one would get gravitational collapse.

76
00:05:58.575 --> 00:06:03.173
The actual construction,
and this is by Fermi,

77
00:06:03.173 --> 00:06:09.903
of an ideal gas of fermions in
a harmonic trap was realized in 1999,

78
00:06:09.903 --> 00:06:16.330
just a few years after Bose–Einstein
condensation was attained.

79
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.536
And it was done with a system
about a million potassium atoms,

80
00:06:21.536 --> 00:06:28.345
a million atoms the isotope potassium-40
in a 3D harmonic oscillator trap,

81
00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:33.472
which reminds me,
I've been meaning to ask you something.

82
00:06:36.745 --> 00:06:42.930
Right, so I hope you figured out
why potassium-40 is a fermion.

83
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.590
It's a composite particle made up of
an odd number of bosons, 59 in total.

84
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.780
And so
this is a schematic of the experiment,

85
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.580
very similar in approach to
the others that we've described,

86
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.140
additional details of a preparation
chamber in a so-called science chamber.

87
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.590
But again, the system is consist
of a magneto optical trap, and

88
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:12.180
then the imaging is done in the same way,
so the shadow image of light

89
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.670
coming through the atoms and
being resolved by a CCD camera.

90
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:23.750
And the key finding in this experiment was
an evaporative cooling curve, so there's

91
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.020
a process of cooling by evaporating
the potassium atoms from the trap,

92
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.400
that evaporative cooling is discussed
in a very easily accessible way

93
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.560
in Eric Cornell's paper, Bose–Einstein
Condensation, in our additional materials.

94
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.878
And what you find is that it becomes
progressively harder to evaporatively cool

95
00:07:46.878 --> 00:07:49.414
as you approach the Fermi temperature.

96
00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:51.730
In fact,
there's sort of a limit is reached.

97
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.890
And this is, again, because in evaporative
cooling, what you're doing is taking,

98
00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:00.870
you have in the trap, you have lots
of hot atoms as well floating around.

99
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.210
And you cut them away and then there's
a re-thermalization, which means that

100
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.480
the temperature goes down because you've
taken the hot material out of the system.

101
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:14.630
So that leads to cooling, but
when you get down to the Fermi,

102
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:20.790
near the Fermi temperature, you're just
removing atoms away from the Fermi level,

103
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.970
so they are more energetic, but
they're not thermally excited.

104
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.748
They just happen to be
the high line state.

105
00:08:27.748 --> 00:08:33.730
So basically, it becomes very hard to
cool fermion atoms compared to bosons.

106
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:43.130
Well, here is an approach to cooling
fermions that goes below that limit.

107
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.160
This is an absolutely wonderful
experiment from a technical standpoint.

108
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.580
It involves trapping two isotopes
of lithium in the same trap.

109
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.447
This is, by the way, made possible by
the isotope shift in atomic energy

110
00:08:59.447 --> 00:09:04.140
levels that we discussed on several
occasions earlier in the course.

111
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.066
Well, that reminds me, there's
something I've been wanting to ask you.

112
00:09:09.066 --> 00:09:13.744
So here is the answer,
Lithium 7 is the boson

113
00:09:13.744 --> 00:09:19.175
because it's a composite
made out of ten fermions.

114
00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:24.230
Lithium 6 is the fermion that's
a composite made out of nine fermions.

115
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.430
And so you see in this sequence of images,

116
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.450
here is the cooling that's
going on from top to bottom.

117
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.170
The two clouds are very similar
at high temperatures, but

118
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:42.040
as you drop the temperature, you can see
that you get a much colder cloud and

119
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.110
more dense on the bosonic side
than on the fermion side.

120
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:58.250
So, that shows a difference in cooling
properties between fermions and bosons.

121
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.360
And we can also take a look at
the problem from another angle.

122
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.909
For many years, there's been
discussion about the connection between

123
00:10:05.909 --> 00:10:08.870
superconductivity and
Bose–Einstein condensation.

124
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.160
So, one simplistic view is that

125
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.060
the Cooper pairs of electrons
that are responsible for

126
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:22.590
superconductivity are a composite boson
and so superconductivity is sort of like

127
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.840
the condensation of the Bose
condensation of Cooper pairs.

128
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.806
But now, the connection between these
two can be mapped out in detail in

129
00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:34.938
ultra cold atom systems.

130
00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:37.840
In a superconductor, we just have
the electrons and the temperature,

131
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:44.330
we can't really vary the pairing
interaction in a controllable way.

132
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.210
When a system of ultra cold atoms,
in this case, Lithium 6,

133
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.960
as was discussed in the previous slide,
the interaction

134
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.980
energy between atoms can be
modified by a Feshbach resonance.

135
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.480
Effectively, it's a sort
of a resonant process

136
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.970
of increasing the strength of pairing
between the atoms in the example.

137
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.940
So, in this case, one is looking
at a phase diagram, pressure,

138
00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.460
as a function of the interaction
energy that's varied.

139
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:21.270
And one can move between the BCS
regime of superconductivity

140
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:26.945
of pairs of loosely bound pairs of
electrons or pairs of atoms here.

141
00:11:26.945 --> 00:11:33.290
But the Cooper pairs, as discussed in
Victor's lecture, reside in this regime.

142
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.703
And then by increasing
the interaction potential,

143
00:11:37.703 --> 00:11:40.511
one can move into the BEC region,

144
00:11:40.511 --> 00:11:46.441
where now you have basically dimers
formed of these fermionic atoms.

145
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:50.676
And they become like a composite boson,
and so

146
00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:54.930
you see Bose-Einstein condensation there.

147
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.960
So, we'll conclude with
a very brief survey

148
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.940
of the state of the art in quantum gasses
in the final part of this lecture.
