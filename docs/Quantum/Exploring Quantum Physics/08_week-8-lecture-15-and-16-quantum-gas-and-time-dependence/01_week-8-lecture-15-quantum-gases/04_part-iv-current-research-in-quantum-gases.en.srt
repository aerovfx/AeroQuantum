00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,250
Hello everyone,
welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:05,650
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,060
We're going to conclude this lecture by
a look at some of the current research

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,920
topics in the area of quantum gases.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,250
Now we're going to look at a few examples

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,610
of current research in
ultracold quantum gases.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,830
And we just have time for
a few topics, but

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,090
I think you'll see
the richness of the field.

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,890
And by looking at references
to these in the open

10
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,810
literature you can find many
other interesting ideas.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,920
So first of all in situ
imaging of individual atoms.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,848
Now this differs from the mode that we've
been using earlier in this lecture.

13
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:44,093
Where we've been discussing
atomic absorption images,

14
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:46,418
which don't resolve individual sides.

15
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:49,620
And there's some amazing
developments in this area.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,180
Another very striking invention,
the cold-atom scanning probe microscope.

17
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,390
So this is something that
might be very suitable

18
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,300
as an extension of
the atomic force microscope

19
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,940
that's based on the use of an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate as a tip.

20
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,010
It's not just a concept.

21
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,478
It's something that has been implemented.

22
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:17,378
Atomic, atom interferometry
over very long distances.

23
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:22,720
10s of meters with flight
times of several seconds.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,127
That can be used to test the equivalence
principle for example, or

25
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,442
do very precise measurements
of Earth rotation.

26
00:01:30,442 --> 00:01:33,957
And then, the optical lattice clock,

27
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:40,359
whose had an amazing development
reported early in the year 2014.

28
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,020
Making it then,
the world's most accurate clock.

29
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,770
And also as we'll see providing
a sort of laboratory for

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,290
studying basic quantum and ebotic physics.

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,921
So to the issue of in-situ imaging.

32
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:02,009
Here's work done by a group of
David Weiss at Penn State University.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,750
You see three images and the glowing
points within each one of these

34
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:16,840
are individual atoms sitting on
the sites on a cubic optical lattice.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,330
And the different columns here have

36
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,450
the image focused on different
interior planes of the lattice.

37
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,210
So what you see,
if you look at just one of these images.

38
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,760
You see the very bright spots.

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,990
Those are individual atoms.

40
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,705
And then there's some fuzzy areas nearby.

41
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:41,820
Those are atoms in a different plane
that's defocused from the image.

42
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,530
And so you can see that the lattice here
is imperfectly and irregularly filled.

43
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,950
On the other hand, every glowing point

44
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,050
is at an optical lattice site in
sort of a regular crystal array.

45
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:01,030
The lower row here is the same system.

46
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:08,009
With a photograph taken three seconds
after the photograph of the upper image.

47
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,814
And so, with this, you can see
that there is both stability and

48
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:18,084
change in the lattice of many common
sites that are occupied in both.

49
00:03:18,084 --> 00:03:20,350
And then, there are also some changes.

50
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,550
So, this just shows remarkably
how you can get regular

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:30,830
registration of atoms and maintain it
over a significant period of time.

52
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,230
An even more amazing example,

53
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,240
involves the creation of an optical
lattice inside an electron microscope.

54
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,105
And in the lattice sites,
a rubidium atom is held.

55
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:55,340
And it's fluorescing, so that you see
the light from the rubidium atoms.

56
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,170
And then the electron beam can
be swept over the system and

57
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,570
selectively ionize the rubidium
atoms in certain sites.

58
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,800
So that you make vacant holes in
the lattice where there are no atoms.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,900
Remarkable act of
precision engineering here.

60
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,130
And my colleague noted that the font
design is rather elegant as well.

61
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,540
This is of course
the SchrÃ¶dinger equation.

62
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:28,908
Finally, on this imaging frontier,
a tremendous development by

63
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:34,320
Markus Greiner's group at Harvard
called the quantum gas microscope.

64
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,705
And here you're seeing
a image of ultra-cold atoms,

65
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:46,568
Bose-Einstein condensate,
held in an optical lattice.

66
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:50,738
With a field of view of 100
microns tenth of a millimeter.

67
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:55,865
Very large, and on the right
here is another image taken of

68
00:04:55,865 --> 00:05:02,889
a smaller region where you can clearly
see this signals from individual atoms.

69
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,080
If you like this sort of thing.

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,631
I strongly recommend looking
at the videos where you

71
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:12,252
actually see real time motion of atoms and

72
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:17,438
optical lattices on a time
scales of fractions of a second.

73
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:18,936
Just fascinating work.

74
00:05:18,936 --> 00:05:23,715
And so this is making possible
analysis of ultracold

75
00:05:23,715 --> 00:05:27,416
atom systems at a degree of resolution.

76
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,576
Simply was not possible
about five years ago.

77
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:36,738
Next topic,
cold-atom scanning probe microscopes.

78
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:41,390
So here's an artist's conception
of an instrument that has

79
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,596
been built at the University of Tumigan,
in Germany.

80
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:49,231
And it compares, a so
called cold atom tip,

81
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:56,026
which is just a Bose Einstein condensate,
held in a small electromagnetic trap.

82
00:05:56,026 --> 00:06:00,170
Compared to a traditional
atomic force microscope tip.

83
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,410
So the AFM, or atomic force microscope,

84
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:08,160
is now a widely use analytical tool for
measuring microstructure.

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,300
The BEC based concept gives a tip about
the same size, but it is a lot softer.

86
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,006
So it can measure surface tip
interactions over greater

87
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:28,826
range than is possible with the standard
conventional atomic force microscopy.

88
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:32,666
Here's the reality of that schematic
that is shown in the previous figure.

89
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:38,306
Very impressive, reported in
Nature Nanotechnology in the year 2011.

90
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:43,840
And this instrument, see here's
the length scale three millimeters.

91
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,990
Consists of a carrier chip, which is here

92
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,530
that can scan a Bose Einstein condensate
back and forth over the sample.

93
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,500
And the sample in this case consists of

94
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,939
carbon nanotubes that have been
grown on the so called nano chip.

95
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,090
And the BEC is scanned over the tubes to

96
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,510
generate a signal that tells you something
about the topography of the tube.

97
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,970
Here is an image from that paper.

98
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,240
The sensing mechanism that's
used in this instrument

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,510
is the loss of the atoms
from the condensate.

100
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,520
So when the condensate is brought
near another material system,

101
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,370
there are attractive forces that are
imposed on the atoms in the condensate.

102
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,880
And some of them can leave the condensate.

103
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,766
They typically don't get more
atoms back in the condensate.

104
00:07:39,766 --> 00:07:45,117
And so the method of analysis of
the system involves optical absorption

105
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:49,680
imaging to determine the population loss,
or its inverse.

106
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,230
The remaining atom fraction.

107
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:58,330
So this is the spatially resolved signal
that's been obtained from that instrument.

108
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,870
There are many other concepts for this
type of scanning probe microscopy using,

109
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,548
for example, polarized,
in polarized atoms to detect

110
00:08:08,548 --> 00:08:14,120
micro-magnetic structure.

111
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,570
Another really amazing
technical development,

112
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,920
long baseline atom in ofrometry.

113
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,980
This is being implemented in Mark
Kasovich's group at Stanford University.

114
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,380
And, here is a schematic.

115
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,200
It's basically a large atomic
fountain clock where ultracold

116
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,650
atom samples produced down here.

117
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,310
It's subject to some
pulses to mix the states,

118
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,060
a sort of typical atomic clock scheme.

119
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,439
Then it flies up and
back about ten meters.

120
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,060
And this system is being
successfully commissioned and

121
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,730
is designed to test
the Equivalence Principle.

122
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,580
That is, whether the inertial mass and
the gravitational mass

123
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,330
are proportional, or
you might say exactly the same.

124
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:10,080
By looking at the differential
acceleration of two species.

125
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,720
So, Rb85 and Rb87 can be used in this
system with very similar optical

126
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,030
control because the transition
wavelengths are quite close together.

127
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:29,419
So this is another application of the use

128
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:35,926
of isotope shifts in
ultracold atomic physics.

129
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:40,374
So finally to conclude,
amazing work done recently

130
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:44,726
in advancing the fundamental
accuracy of clocks.

131
00:09:44,726 --> 00:09:47,894
And as of Spring of 2014,

132
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:53,089
this accuracy of a few
parts in ten to the 18th,

133
00:09:53,089 --> 00:10:01,220
has gone beyond what was done
previously in a single ion based clock.

134
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,660
The remarkable thing about this instrument

135
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,960
is that it's using many atom system
trapped in an optical lattice.

136
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,300
Though, with minimal multiple
occupancy of lattice sites.

137
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,730
And it has been characterized in
particular by this measurement

138
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,940
of the blackbody radiation
shift on the two clock states.

139
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,178
This is a very subtle effect but
modern clocks have become so

140
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:33,264
accurate that the determination of
the blackbody radiation effects on

141
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:38,366
atomic transition frequencies has
become a major effort in the world.

142
00:10:38,366 --> 00:10:40,526
Both theoretically, and experimentally.

143
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:47,566
Another use for clocks is the sensors.

144
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:51,761
Because if you can measure shifts and
frequency to a very high accuracy,

145
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:55,361
you can determine the effects
of environmental influences.

146
00:10:55,361 --> 00:11:00,879
So, things like magnotomatry,
assilamontometry, gidaroscopy, gravity

147
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:07,080
gradiomantry are all a good applications
area for very high precision clocks.

148
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,860
And also, fundamental scientific study.

149
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,828
So this is an example of one such
use of the optical lattice clock

150
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:16,750
that was just on the previous slide.

151
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:22,458
It's used as a laboratory for
understanding some quantum many-body

152
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:27,980
effects associated with interactions
between atoms in the clock.

153
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,740
So that concludes this very brief survey.

154
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,110
There are many other topics
that could be raised.

155
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,540
But I hope you've captured some of
the excitement and interest in this field.

156
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,710
And seen how it's spawning.

157
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,578
Well, it's not really spawning what
you would call commercial technologies

158
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,640
at the present time.

159
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,597
But it certainly has spawned,

160
00:11:45,597 --> 00:11:49,670
a vast range of improvements in
basic measurement techniques.

161
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:55,065
Fundamental scientific understanding,
and some applications of sensing

162
00:11:55,065 --> 00:11:59,880
that are based on new previously
unexplored physical principles.

163
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,940
It's all made possible by
the ability to cool, or trap atoms.

164
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,858
Prepare them in a deterministic way,
and analyze them.

165
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:13,760
And it's a very exciting field of research
that I hope you'll keep track of.
