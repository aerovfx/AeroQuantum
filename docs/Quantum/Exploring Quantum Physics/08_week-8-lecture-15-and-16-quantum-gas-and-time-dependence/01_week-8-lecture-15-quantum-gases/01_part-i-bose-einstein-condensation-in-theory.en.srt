00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,720
Hello everyone,
welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,620
I'm Charles Clark,
we're now beginning the last week of

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,350
lectures which is going to focus
on current research topics.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:15,396
And we'll begin with the study of
the state of the art in quantum gasses.

5
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:22,821
We're going to begin by looking at the
problem of ultra-cold Bose-Einstein gases,

6
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:27,260
which lead to the famous phenomena
of Bose-Einstein condensation.

7
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,070
So we'll start by seeing how
that concept originated.

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,420
And the basic idea began very simply.

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,620
Albert Einstein decided to understand how
to quantize many particle systems and

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,220
he chose the simplest one,
the ideal gas, to ask the question of

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,980
what's the equation of state of an idea
gas when you apply quantum mechanics?

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:57,550
So, the simplest approach is to construct
quantum states of motion for a single

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,830
gas atom and then ask how do these get
modified when many atoms are present.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,570
So Einstein decided to try
the following assumption that for

15
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:15,420
a given quantum state any
number of atoms can occupy it.

16
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,470
So, there's no restriction on the number
of atoms that can be in the same

17
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,980
quantum state of the system.

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,350
So, if you think of a particle in a box
the ground state has no nodes and

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,570
presumably you can populate that state
with as many atoms as you'd like.

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,310
And then, you use statistical mechanics
to calculate the properties of the gas

21
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,680
in thermal equilibrium.

22
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,890
So now, in modern language,

23
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,230
this assumption that any number of
atoms can occupy given a quantum state

24
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,460
is called Bose Einstein statistics
which will apply to bosons,

25
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:01,040
which have integer spin zero,
one, two, and so on.

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,856
So photon is a boson, and
a pair of fairmions is also a boson,

27
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:10,060
we'll get to that momentarily.

28
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,510
Well, in carrying out this
seemingly simple program,

29
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,970
Einstein discovered something
absolutely amazing.

30
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,920
Here is the original paper
in which he announces it.

31
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,700
And he describes the finding here in blue,
I'll give you my own translation.

32
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,870
He starts by considering the problem
of compressing an ideal gas

33
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,010
at a constant temperature.

34
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:46,550
So you take a gas that has some particular
value, take the air in the room,

35
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,730
and you keep the temperature
constant while condensing it.

36
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,750
And he finds that for a given temperature,

37
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,650
there's a saturation
density of the ideal gas.

38
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,740
So in other words, as you keep compressing
it you reach a critical pressure

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,010
at which suddenly a number
of the molecules of the gas

40
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,210
no longer engage in thermal motion, so

41
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,960
its like you create by increasing
the pressure, a new phase of the gas,

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,430
which has zero temperature,
this is very strange.

43
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,020
And in fact Einstein, in this paper,
wondered whether it was simply

44
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,640
a mathematical artifact of the theory and
had any correspondence in reality.

45
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,660
Well when does this condensation
phenomena occur and what is it?

46
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,490
So we're going to go back and

47
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,970
return to classical statistical
mechanics which is what Einstein used.

48
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,000
Now, you might say it's quasi-classical
because it has a Planck's constant in it,

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,230
but this is the accepted standard form for

50
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,800
calculating the number of thermally
accessible states of a classical system.

51
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,200
And you will recall that
in the previous lecture,

52
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,220
we discussed the calculation of
the partition function in this form.

53
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,190
So I trust you were able to
evaluate that integral again.

54
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,330
And here's the,
let me rewrite the partition function

55
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,970
by taking the contribution
from the volume out front and

56
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,150
then isolating this contribution from
the momentum divided by h bar cubed.

57
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,990
So this first integral just
has the dimensions of volume.

58
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,790
In fact, we might just have
v equals 0 inside a box and

59
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,690
use that as a volume for
the purposes of thinking about this.

60
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,820
And the second integral also has
the dimensions of volume, or

61
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,220
the inverse dimensions of volume.

62
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,120
You see it's, you can think about
the uncertainty principle p over h

63
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,720
is equal to 1 over x.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,560
So in fact this partition function
takes a simple form, easy to remember.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,190
It's the ratio of the volume to the cube
of the de Broglie wavelength, and

66
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,695
the de Broglie wavelength
is defined as the well,

67
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,845
this integral here is an integral
over three spatial dimensions.

68
00:05:24,845 --> 00:05:28,205
The de Broglie wavelength is defined

69
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:31,795
as the inverse of the one dimensional
equivalent of that integral.

70
00:05:33,395 --> 00:05:36,945
That's right here, and so
that's the de Broglie wavelength there,

71
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,795
inversely proportional to
the square root of temperature.

72
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,650
Now the conventional
terminology in this field is to

73
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:50,550
measure quantum gases in terms
of their phase space density.

74
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,260
Which is if you have a gas with a given
number density, say a number of atoms per

75
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,140
cubic centimeter, then the phase
space density is a pure number.

76
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,360
So product of the density and
the cube of the de Broglie wavelength and

77
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,290
it has the interpretation of
being the number of atoms

78
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,530
that exist in the sample per
available quantum state.

79
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,520
So let's see what that implies,
here's a cartoon

80
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,490
from a very nice paper by Eric Cornell,
which you can find additional materials.

81
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,400
It's a good introduction,

82
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,030
an accessible introduction to
Bose-Einstein Condensation.

83
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,250
And it makes note that in an ideal,
classical gas,

84
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,080
there's basically one scale
parameter that describes the gas.

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,270
It's the mean distance per particle or
the inverse cube root

86
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,470
of the number density that represents
the average separation of particles.

87
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,060
In the quantum gas there
is a new length scale

88
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,920
that's introduced by the de
Broglie wavelength, and

89
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,570
this is a wave length that
depends upon the temperatures.

90
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,450
It depends upon the mean thermal
energy of the gas, you might say.

91
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:18,660
So the interesting physics occurs when
these two length scales become comparable,

92
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,770
in other words when the face based
density of the system approaches one.

93
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,020
And what happens then is that
as the phase based density

94
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,230
increases above the critical
value needed for condensation,

95
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:37,340
a value that depends on circumstances
that we'll discuss a little bit later,

96
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,430
then macroscopic number of atoms
occupy the ground state of the system.

97
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,670
So in other words,

98
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,650
a significant fraction of the system
has effectively zero temperature.

99
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,850
And as the phase based density increases,

100
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,060
a larger quantity of the system
goes into the ground state.

101
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,739
Well let's see how close we are to
Bose-Einstein condensation in

102
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:06,873
everyday life.

103
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:14,129
So you see, the air in your room
right now is not very close to

104
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:18,000
being a Bose-Einstein condensate.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,830
And if you just take a simple
consideration of what would be required to

106
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,920
get it to a phase-based density,
of one, you have two choices.

107
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,970
You either increase number density
by a factor of ten to the seventh.

108
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,270
If you did that,
you'd have a very heavy form of matter.

109
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,490
It would be nothing like an ideal gas and

110
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,000
these ideas of Einstein would
simply be inapplicable.

111
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,560
As an alternative you might decrease the
temperature by a factor of 10 to the 5th.

112
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,340
Well that brings you down
to the milli Kelvin regime,

113
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,090
rather hard to access and

114
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,380
also almost everything freezes
out at such a cold temperature.

115
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,295
And so, basically, the prospects for

116
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:13,030
Bose-Einstein condensation for a very
long time seemed to be very improbable.

117
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:18,120
So, here's a very nice book by
Schroedinger, a little essay,

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,490
of probably only 100 pages long or
so on on statistical thermodynamics.

119
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,620
He covers a number of interesting
topics in this book, and

120
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,380
here's a quote which represents
the consensus feeling in the scientific

121
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,230
community, that the conditions
of phase-based density are so

122
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,370
demanding, that they're just never
going to apply to ordinary matter.

123
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,060
Nevertheless, there were signs of the
existence of same like the Bose-Einstein

124
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,720
condensation and most notably
the phenomena of Helium super fluidity.

125
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,190
That was discovered in 1938 and
very quickly,

126
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,552
it was suggested by
Fritz London that the super

127
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:09,420
fluidity of Helium was related in some
way to Bose-Einstein condensation.

128
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,370
However, liquid helium
is a dense system and

129
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,300
very strong interactions
exist between the atoms.

130
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,430
So its not really reasonable to suggest
that it has the dynamics of an ideal gas,

131
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,930
and there are a lot of problems associated
with trying to treat liquid helium

132
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,510
as if it were a Bose-Einstein condensate,
but then about

133
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:40,490
70 years later, the situation changed
which is the topic of the next part.
