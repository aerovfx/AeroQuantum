00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,640
Welcome back, everyone,
to Exploring Quantum Physics.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,400
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,460
And today,
you're going to follow the bouncing ball.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,997
So just to remind you,
we're working with special functions.

5
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:16,859
And today, in this part,

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,490
we're going to especially be
involved with the area function.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:27,320
So I encourage you to make this
reference available to you.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,110
Though, everything I'll show
you is self contained but

9
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,430
this is a good source of
additional information.

10
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,709
It's also appropriate for
me to remind you of the short course.

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,290
Crash course on mathematics.

12
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:47,000
Reference on the solution of
known Schrodinger equations.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,250
And access to simple numerical
integrate that runs on a spreadsheet.

14
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,979
In the previous part, we started out and

15
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,138
we treated the first of these three
simple one dimensional examples.

16
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:07,804
And we're now going to today this part,

17
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:11,640
look at the linear potential.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,148
And I think actually just,

19
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:17,488
we will have a very brief discussion
about the quadratic potential at the end.

20
00:01:17,488 --> 00:01:21,979
I think linear potential does, is the best
thing to focus on because it gives one

21
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,401
a very good framework for comprehensive
understanding of the solution of

22
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:29,061
one-dimensional Schrodinger equation.

23
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:37,328
Now in the previous part, we solved for
this constant potential and

24
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:42,545
we found that we could transform the
Schrodinger equation into a standard form.

25
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:50,271
And the key point about
that standard form,

26
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:55,674
well there were two variants of it,
difference in size,

27
00:01:55,674 --> 00:02:03,118
according to whether E what was greater
than or less than the constant denote.

28
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,500
But in both cases,
we could have identified two solutions.

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,750
Now, I should have brought this
point up in the previous part.

30
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,260
But here's a really good tool for
helping you to

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,780
make decisions about choices
of the alternative pairs

32
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,540
of wave functions that you will always
face in solving the Schrodinger equation.

33
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,330
This is the so-called Wronskian.

34
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:39,225
The Wronskian two
functions is given by fg'.

35
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:44,570
g prime equals dg dx.

36
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:50,208
And this is a very good comparison
tool to your decision making.

37
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,869
So the in line quiz,
I'm going to invite you to discover for

38
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:58,769
yourself the key property the Wronskian
operates on, why it's so useful.

39
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,870
So I guess you can see
that in these two cases,

40
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,530
you can calculate the Wronskian
in these two functions easily.

41
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,920
It's plus or
minus 1 depending upon how you do it.

42
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,503
And here it's plus or minus 2, I guess.

43
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:21,683
Depending on how you do it.

44
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:26,254
But perhaps if you think about it,

45
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:30,203
you'll see that if you have,

46
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:40,528
If you divergent behavior,
in this case of one function,

47
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:47,863
then we should be able to find
another one that converges.

48
00:03:47,863 --> 00:03:52,043
Or, maybe it's easier
to say that if you have

49
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:57,213
oscillatory behavior of one
function in this region and

50
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:02,163
you pick another one,
then that's also a solution,

51
00:04:02,163 --> 00:04:09,316
it's also going to be oscillating in
order to keep the Wronskian a constant.

52
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:13,562
The real importance is that these
alternative pairs of solutions,

53
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,656
the Wronskian must be constant.

54
00:04:18,696 --> 00:04:22,190
Now the solution to the linear potential,

55
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,176
a Schrodinger equation
with linear potential.

56
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:30,863
It's a very nice properties, and
so I suppose that these are,

57
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:36,259
I suppose the airy functions must be
less familiar to everybody than must

58
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:42,638
be less familiar than the exponential or
the trigonometric functions to everybody.

59
00:04:42,638 --> 00:04:49,424
But if this is your first exposure to
them, let me point out that this case,

60
00:04:49,424 --> 00:04:54,492
linear potential gives us
two universal solutions that

61
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:59,990
combine both the oscillatory
behavior of the trigonometric

62
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,979
functions and the exponential diverging or

63
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,748
converging behavior of
the exponential function.

64
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:13,971
So there's basically a universal

65
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:19,013
function of each type that covers

66
00:05:19,013 --> 00:05:25,687
behavior in the allowed versus forbidden,

67
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:34,565
Regions, and that is,
if you have a linear potential,

68
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:40,134
then eventually,
depending on the choice of V1, eventually,

69
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:44,908
the potential eventually
gets larger than the energy.

70
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:48,700
Or, eventually gets smaller than
the energy, either way around.

71
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,860
So in this sense, linear potential,
is a very nice tool for

72
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,210
understanding, the behavior of
quantum mechanical wave functions.

73
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,412
So, again,
in these case there's a demarkation point.

74
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:08,900
Of course these are two particular
choices of function and

75
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,280
you can find their
definitions in this chapter.

76
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,933
And they both oscillate for
when the argument is less than 0,

77
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:25,928
and then the Ai converges for
row greater than 0 and Bi diverges.

78
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:30,329
And these two have implementations
in physical systems and

79
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,170
what we're going to look at in detail
here is the quantum mechanical

80
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:40,099
bouncing ball but the second type
very function becomes important

81
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,698
in modeling things like
the scanning tunneling microscope.

82
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:48,761
Now the bouncing ball problem is,
as you'll see,

83
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:53,677
it's important from a technical
theoretical perspective,

84
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:58,307
in terms of learning how to
solve a shorting equation, but

85
00:06:58,307 --> 00:07:04,640
actually is something that has been
recently realized a remarkable experiment

86
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,430
of the bouncing of a neutron confined
in a trap and bouncing off a mirror.

87
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,400
And there's actually experiments that
measured the quantum mechanical spectrum

88
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,830
of the neutron subject to
the Earth's gravitational field.

89
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,780
There have also been some implementations
in ultra cool atom systems.

90
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,500
So, we're actually going
to solve the problem with

91
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,830
reference to parameters that are germaine
to this recent experimental realization.

92
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,440
So, here we're going to describe
this amazing neutron experiment.

93
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,860
The starting point is something
from freshman physics.

94
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,200
V is equal to Mgh, or
V is equal to Mgx, so

95
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,210
the potential energy of
the neutron is given by this where

96
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,969
x is the distance going vertically
off the surface of the mirror.

97
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,280
G, acceleration due to
the Earth's gravity,

98
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,685
we'll just take a nominal value
9.8 meters per second squared.

99
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:15,010
M, the mass of the neutron about
the same as the mass of a proton.

100
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,260
Here's a nominal value, we're just
going to use a round number value.

101
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,510
And now, here is the boundary
condition for x equal to 0.

102
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,255
So in other words the wave function has
to vanish at the surface of the mirror,

103
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:32,328
that's and
idealization which is largely true.

104
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:36,750
And then it's got wave function oscillate.

105
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,688
And reach a point of,
whatever the energy is, the wave function

106
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:46,808
must die off eventually in order for
the neutron to be localized and

107
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:51,398
continue to bounce back and
forth in the way that we expect.

108
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:56,582
Now, in order to cast this
equation into appropriate

109
00:08:56,582 --> 00:09:02,341
dimensional form, I'm going to use,
we're going to define,

110
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:06,718
I've worked this problem out in advance,
so

111
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:13,974
to define our dimensions coordinate
rho in terms of this transformation,

112
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:19,068
and I'd like you to look at
that in the in video quiz.

113
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:23,508
Right, well I hope that you found
that you could solve the quiz.

114
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:32,948
You saw the quiz question using
dimensional analysis only.

115
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:36,947
Because if you just look at e over mg,
I mean that tells you the,

116
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:41,339
that dimensional analysis of this
expression tells you the answer.

117
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,770
Yeah, so in other words, this parameter
alpha has to have the units of energy.

118
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,518
I mean since rho's dimensions this as
well you can see the past quite clear.

119
00:09:59,058 --> 00:10:04,280
Now, in the next brief inline quiz,
just take it a step further and

120
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,586
this has to do with
the relationship between rho and x.

121
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:16,350
So, if you were to draw a rho axis,
where does it go in this mirror and what?

122
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,828
For example, there's an important issue
regarding, what does rho equal 0 mean?

123
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:27,609
What is the physical interpretation
of the value that particular match

124
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:28,970
thiis coordinate?

125
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:37,026
So, I hope it was obvious,
I hope it was easy, for you to find that

126
00:10:37,026 --> 00:10:42,158
the value of rho equals 0 describes
the classical turning point.

127
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:50,443
That is the place where
the velocity changes sign,

128
00:10:50,443 --> 00:10:56,609
it represents the maximum distance,

129
00:10:56,609 --> 00:11:01,424
maximum value of x for which is

130
00:11:01,424 --> 00:11:06,642
attained in classical motion.

131
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:14,662
So that means that the function
that we want is Ai because what,

132
00:11:14,662 --> 00:11:19,452
it obtains its maximum a little
bit before rho equals 0 but

133
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:24,534
it's the one that dies off as
rho gets large, as rho increases

134
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:29,958
in the pause of region which is
the class of the forbidden region.

135
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:32,078
So we know that we must,

136
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,488
of the two solutions that we
are going to use, we must use Ai.

137
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,088
That is the only acceptable solution

138
00:11:42,448 --> 00:11:47,016
In the region rho greater than 0
because the only other possible

139
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:51,923
solution there would involve
an admixture of Bi because any solution

140
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:56,588
in this region can be written as
a linear combination of Ai and Bi.

141
00:11:56,588 --> 00:12:03,560
The one unique solution, up to some
constant multiple factor, is Ai.

142
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,000
So if we take that, we now say now how,
knowing that that is the solution,

143
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,680
how do we satisfy the boundary condition

144
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,774
that si of x equals 0 = 0?

145
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:24,230
Well, we're going to write a wave function

146
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:29,730
In terms of an airy function so we have
an additional parameter available to us,

147
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:35,540
which is the constant
offset in the solution.

148
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,840
And so that means that we basically,

149
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,160
we take this airy function and
we start pulling it up

150
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,650
until the node lies at the relevant,
at the surface of the mirror.

151
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:58,740
So, I think you can see that what we're
going to get, here's the lowest solution

152
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,230
is going to be like that, and
then the next lowest solution, oops.

153
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,910
The first excited state has one node
on the wave function and so on.

154
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,142
So basically, this curve Ai shows
you a universal set of profiles

155
00:13:17,142 --> 00:13:22,847
of the excited states of the bouncing
ball, and they're just obtained

156
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:29,528
by displacing the surface of the mirror to
each successive node in the solution AI.

157
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:33,252
Now we'll conclude
actually really with just

158
00:13:33,252 --> 00:13:38,130
a brief description of what goes
on in the quadratic system.

159
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,538
We're not going to discuss
that in a lot of detail.

160
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:45,098
The most important case of this is
concerns the harmonic oscillator.

161
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:50,160
Which we've solved elsewhere,
but there's sometimes

162
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,224
things like harmonic oscillator
with impurities in it,

163
00:13:55,224 --> 00:13:59,970
or disruptions, and so
it's nice to have the ability

164
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:04,308
to solve the general
second order equation and.

165
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:08,793
I'll point that once again,
it turns out that

166
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:14,428
the divergent character of
solutions is the generic one.

167
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:19,536
So for example, in this system, because of

168
00:14:19,536 --> 00:14:24,928
the quadratic dependence of x, eventually,

169
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:34,188
V is greater than E.

170
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:37,791
If you go sufficiently far away,
sufficient large values of x,

171
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:41,078
positive or negative,
you're in the forbidden region.

172
00:14:41,078 --> 00:14:44,504
So, because you have propagation,

173
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:49,697
because you have a wave
equation in a forbidden region,

174
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:56,435
you always get a divergent solution,
but then there are special cases,

175
00:14:56,435 --> 00:15:02,732
and these are exactly the Igendouse and
harmonic oscillator here,

176
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:08,880
you can see the harmonic
oscillator look at the equation.

177
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:15,285
That when n is an integer
you get bound Igenstate,

178
00:15:15,285 --> 00:15:21,234
this just shows
the characteristics of this so

179
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:26,278
called parabolic cylinder function.

180
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:36,518
And we're not going to make practical
use of that in this course.

181
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,538
But, I thought you should see it.

182
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:44,067
Again, the quadratic equations
solutions to the shortage equates for

183
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:49,319
a quadratic potential are part of
this systematic family of special

184
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:55,696
functions that's been developed to solve
the Schrodinger equation in general.

185
00:15:55,696 --> 00:15:57,996
>> Okay that concludes this lecture.

186
00:15:57,996 --> 00:15:59,490
I hope to see you in the next one.
