00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,540
Hello everyone.
Welcome back to exploring quantum physics.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,478
I'm Charles Clark.

3
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:11,420
We're now going to continue a simple
variational approach and apply it to

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:17,151
calculating the ground state energy wave
function

5
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:23,690
of hydrogen atom.
So now we're going to evaluate

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,230
a variational technique in three
dimensions of considering the ground-state

7
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,540
energy wave function of the hydrogen atom
and we'll use for that purpose the

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,800
three dimensional generalization of our
simple Gaussian function, which is

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,540
just a product of the same thing in x, y
and z with the normalization coefficient.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,500
And this is the ground state of an
isotropic harmonic oscillator in three

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,940
dimensions when the parameter, d is

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,450
related to the mass and the frequency by
this

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,350
equation d is root h bar over m omega.

14
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:06,276
So we're just going to now do a simple
variational calculation do an

15
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:13,740
expectation value of psi H psi.

16
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,330
Right, so here's, here's the the, the wave
function, the Hamiltonian and here's

17
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,460
the the quantity we're estimating in terms
of the

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,040
contribution of the kinetic and the
potential energy parts.

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,860
>> Well, the kinetic energy is easy, is
easy because we did that once already.

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,410
we know that, that it contains a
contribution of one quarter

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,430
h bar squared over md squared from each of
these three terms.

22
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,690
So in this case, it's it's straightforward

23
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,710
to do the calculation in Cartesian
coordinates, even though the

24
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,000
system has spherical symmetry because the
calculation was already done.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,440
I mean, you can just, you can just recall
it, and easily do it again.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,790
So, this the value of this is just a sort
of the universal expression

27
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,830
for the average kinetic energy of a local
a function localized on

28
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:16,138
a length scale of d.
Now for the the potential energy,

29
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:21,440
it's it, work is made, very much easier

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,360
by going to spherical polar coordinates
because the the potential energy

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,436
is spherically symmetric and so I'm just.

32
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,560
He, here are, here are the prefactors.

33
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,114
Note that we get this 1 over d cubed from
the expr,

34
00:02:40,114 --> 00:02:45,070
from the the square of the wave function
and then here is

35
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,650
the here is the expression for the
integrand in spherical polar coordinates.

36
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,747
This 4 pi comes from integrating, over
angles.

37
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,010
so I'm not going to dwell on that.

38
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,070
you know, you really do need to know how
to do integrals

39
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:09,950
over spherical coordinates versus
Cartesian coordinates

40
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,160
in order to do interesting quantum
mechanics.

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,470
So for those who need a review look at our

42
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,880
crash course in math and, practice a few
simple examples.

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,960
In any event, I think you can

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,120
see that this integral is straightforward
to evaluate.

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,480
In fact,

46
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,340
I would say, whenever you're faced with an
integral of the type x to the n

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,080
e to the minus x squared, you should know
how to do that.

48
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:41,410
Find out the general expression, it's a
gamma function.

49
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,830
So least you should recognize that when
you would, whenever you encounter

50
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,860
an expression like this, the integral is
well-known and you can consult

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,100
the properties of the gamma function to
find out how

52
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,560
to do it yourself or you can just look it
up.

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,790
In any event here's the important result.

54
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,618
And as I mentioned in the previous part,
the contribution of the

55
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:12,740
kine, the kinetic ener the potential
energy, sorry, goes as 1 over d.

56
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,570
So, you see.

57
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,510
Now there are some factors here, right,

58
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,880
there are some numerical factors but this
approach,

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,100
captures the right scaling

60
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,110
of the the, the potential energy
contribution.

61
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,115
That's something very important about the

62
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:35,050
variational approach that when it's
implemented with

63
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,250
an appropriate wave function like the
Gaussian,

64
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,970
you're going to get the scaling right.

65
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,430
The actual numerical answer may not be
that accurate, but you'll, you'll

66
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,510
capture much of the essential physics and
it's, it's simple to implement.

67
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,400
Okay, so now, to, to find the value of d
we

68
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,109
just minimize this, minimize with

69
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:08,210
respect to d, and then, and then you, then
use

70
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,480
the absolute value then use the average
value of the energy that we find there.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,220
And when you do that, you'll find that

72
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,992
this is the expression that you get.
I encourage you to work this out.

73
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:25,544
it's a fairly, if you just use the
ingredients that

74
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:29,410
we developed here within the past several
minutes, it's straightforward.

75
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,440
It'll give you actual experience in in
solving the, you know,

76
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,260
solving an important physical problem with
a, with a simple approach.

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,820
And the answer is that you get here, is
off by,

78
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,930
the exact answer by 15%, which is, I mean,

79
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,010
you know, you need to have better
aspirations than that.

80
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:57,330
But by doing things this way, you have
captured the right scaling.

81
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,460
So in other words, the dependence, this,

82
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,460
the Rydberg constant is the binding
energy, is

83
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,880
proportional to the binding energy of the
I guess this is, this is actually the

84
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,190
R infinity hc to get the appropriate
energies.

85
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,200
In any, in any event you've captured the

86
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,840
right dependence upon the mass which is
non, that's a non-trivial thing.

87
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,340
The energy of the hydrogen atom as
opposed, opposed to the mass,

88
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,020
of the reduced mass that the, the square
of the nuclear charge.

89
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,640
So

90
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,550
again, this is, this is something you use
as a first approach rather than a, to get

91
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,080
an accurate answer but it gives you very
good guidance.

92
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,010
So let me mention a few other things.

93
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,990
you can explore a wide range of problems
with this approach like you can go

94
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,770
to, ask questions about, large spatial
dimensionality, you know?

95
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,280
What's the volume and surface are of an
N-dimensional sphere?

96
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,070
You can actually you can actually find
that answer with the Gaussian estimate.

97
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:23,420
you, you might ask, well, what's the, the
energy of an N-dimensional hydrogen atom?

98
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,150
So let's, let's suppose we have, let's
suppose we have

99
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,920
this potential here, but in, but we have N
spatial dimensions.

100
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,660
What's the, you know, what's, what's the
energy?

101
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,650
this is an, sort of an abstract question,
but it's the sort of

102
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,915
thing that If you're a theoretical
physicist,

103
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:45,000
you like to explore these these issues.

104
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,540
estimating ground states of other power
law

105
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,890
potentials like a quartic or a linear
potential.

106
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:57,030
And so, once again, these are cases where
if you

107
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,835
have to make an estimate you may not have
insight

108
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:05,300
as to how to find the exact eigenvalue in
a convenient

109
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,270
way, but you'll always have the ability to
integrate a Gaussian function.

110
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,720
Even if you do it numerically numerical

111
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,170
implementation of that integral is very
easy.

112
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,389
And you have the kinetic energy part
already available for you for free.

113
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,580
Now there was an interesting discussion
put in the, in

114
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,100
one of the student forums last week and,
and I thought

115
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,820
I'd just address it quickly because it,
it, it indicates

116
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,880
another aspect of the harmonic oscillator
that's very important and interesting.

117
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,054
so the question has to do with the

118
00:08:40,054 --> 00:08:40,787
[COUGH],

119
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:45,785
excuse me, the three dimensional harmonic
oscillator and, what if you place the

120
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:46,180
[COUGH],

121
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,670
the oscillator in a magnetic or electric
field?

122
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,410
how will that affect the energies?

123
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:51,895
So

124
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:52,980
[COUGH],

125
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,540
we'll deal with the magnetic question
later, but this

126
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,410
is a good point to just address this
issue.

127
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,120
What happens if you add an electric, if
you put a harmonic oscillator, a charged

128
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,680
particle, a harmonic oscillator, and apply
an electric field to it?

129
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,858
In fact, this is exactly the same problem
that's encountered in laboratories today.

130
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:18,210
looking at Bose-Einstein condensation in
ultracold atoms typically

131
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,310
these are confined by a, a harmo a trap
that's effectively harmonic, but the atoms

132
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,418
are also present in the Earth, in the

133
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:29,080
Earth's gravitational field, which is a
linear potential.

134
00:09:30,172 --> 00:09:36,500
and so exactly this type of, of correction
has to be applied to those systems.

135
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,990
And so it has some interesting
consequences.

136
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:44,350
In any event, the key point here is that
the electric field is represented

137
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,224
in quantum mechanics.

138
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:48,500
Effect of electric field is represented by
a linear potential.

139
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,840
So this is, this is the form of the
electric field.

140
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,790
So when we add that, to the harmonic
oscillator

141
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,410
potential then we get this.
But do you see,

142
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,765
we can just define a new coordinate.
We just shift, we just displace.

143
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:14,360
I've, I've chosen the field to lie along
the x axis for convenience.

144
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,840
It doesn't matter what direction you use.

145
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,510
Just define the x axis as the axis of the
electric field.

146
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,240
And so if you define a set of new
coordinates where the

147
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,980
x, the, the, the field along the the
coordinate that lies along

148
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,320
the field is just, it's origin has just
shifted and the other

149
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,390
two coordinates are the same, then you get
a harmonic oscillator vac

150
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,840
here and then by completing the square on
this

151
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,050
term, you see you get, you get an overall

152
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:50,980
shift in the energy.
So, in fact the

153
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,780
harmonic potential when you displace it by
a linear potential, the ordering of

154
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,720
levels in the spectrum is the same but
they're all shifted downwards,

155
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,400
by this constant amount.

156
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,776
This constant amount is related to the
polarized ability of,

157
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:10,570
of the harmonic oscillator, another
quality fundamental interest in physics.

158
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,810
So the last topic that we'll treat in this
part

159
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,990
of the lecture is the introduction of
another trial function.

160
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:27,330
So, we had, we had an e to the minus r
squared over 2d squared.

161
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,700
That's a nice localized

162
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,340
function, as a radial function.

163
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,640
And we found this is, this is the, the
ground state of a

164
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,412
harmonic oscillator for an appropriate
choice of

165
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:42,270
frequency mass and the length length
parameter.

166
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,830
So this is another another nicely
localized

167
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,740
function, you know, as a function of r.

168
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:55,096
it, it falls off, it converges, converges
exponentially so it's

169
00:11:55,096 --> 00:12:00,098
something that is very easy to implement
numerically.

170
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:06,594
And uh,for your convenience, I've
normalized it here

171
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:12,278
so you might want to check that
normalization, might want to

172
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:18,790
verify that integral d cubed r psi squared
is equal to 1.

173
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,070
I mean, I hope I've done it right.

174
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,285
and we can ask, using this constructive
procedure, is it the solution of a

175
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:31,030
Schrodinger equation?
So I'm asking you that question, and if

176
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,000
you recall, what you do is you say, okay T
plus v

177
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,346
psi equals E psi.
So we get, from

178
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,920
that, sorry, E is equal

179
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,042
to 1 over psi T psi plus v.

180
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:59,640
You just, compute, you just, this thing
that you, is something you can calculate

181
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,480
and from that, you see if there's a, what
v and E this correspond to.

182
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,130
And so, I'm asking you to do that at the
conclusion.

183
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,486
So we will conclude with in video quiz.

184
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:16,140
I hope that's straightforward and works
out well

185
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,870
for you and we'll see you next time.
