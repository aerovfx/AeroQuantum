00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.470
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.430
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.920
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.291
In this lecture we're going to use the
variational method to make estimates of

5
00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:11.396
the properties of quantum
mechanical systems.

6
00:00:14.853 --> 00:00:19.850
Now there's been a lot of material that
you've been exposed to in this course.

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.080
And I'd just like to
make one recommendation.

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.660
And that is,
if you can remember one thing,

9
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.230
one thing to sort of commit to memory.

10
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.830
Which we're going to give you some
encouragement to do so by the practice in

11
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.868
this part of the lecture,
it's this simple Gaussian function.

12
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:41.360
Its shape is it's

13
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.439
a little lump,
with a width that's proportional to d, and

14
00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:51.252
it's easy to integrate.

15
00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:57.840
Numerically it's a very practical
thing to use, it's easy to calculate,

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.510
and it happens to be,
here where g is just a parameter.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.470
It has the units of length.

18
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.890
It expresses the characteristic
length scale of the function and

19
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.680
it enters the normalization
coefficient here.

20
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:19.183
You see the wave function has the units
of one over the square root of length.

21
00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:26.230
And now although d is just
a parameter in this wave function,

22
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.820
when we interpret this as the ground
state of a harmonic oscillator.

23
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.935
Then d the characteristic length scale,
is the square root of h bar,

24
00:01:40.935 --> 00:01:45.398
Plank's constant, divided by the mass and

25
00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:50.430
the frequency of the oscillator.

26
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.530
So in other words,
you can use this function.

27
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.820
You can remember it as the ground
state of the harmonic oscillator, but

28
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.490
then you can use it in a very arbitrary
way to represent wave functions of

29
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.560
complicated systems.

30
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.280
So now,
we're going to do a calculation and

31
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.230
it's something,
we're just going to do it once.

32
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.200
Because when you do it once,
I'm going to give you a numonic,

33
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.540
I hope you can will be useful for
you to remember the result.

34
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.190
And that is to calculate the expectation
value of the kinetic energy

35
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.200
operator applied to this wave function,
which is in the one-dimensional

36
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.900
kinetic energy, operator mass is
bar square root 2m dx squared.

37
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.670
Now, this is a straightforward integral

38
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.600
if you just differentiate
this function twice.

39
00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:46.080
But I want you to think
about how you can do it

40
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.650
without actually doing
explicit integral and

41
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.150
be able to remember how the procedure
works and to reproduce it when necessary.

42
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.810
And the trick is the Virial Theorem, which
you encountered in a previous homework,

43
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.060
and I think it was mentioned
in an earlier lecture.

44
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.250
And that is for the harmonic oscillator,

45
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.730
here's the Hamiltonian
with the usual form.

46
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.620
Kinetic energy and the potential
energy that's indicated there.

47
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.620
The Virial Theorem states that the
expectation value of the kinetic energy

48
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.510
over the wave function is equal to the
expectation value of the potential energy.

49
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.440
So these two terms make on the average

50
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.960
an equal contribution to the total energy.

51
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.070
So now I'd like you to think about what
that implies for their actual values.

52
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.440
So I hope that you remembered
how to get that result.

53
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.760
The Virial Theorem states that
the two contributions are equal.

54
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.442
Well then the, we must have T.

55
00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:08.270
+<v> =E, the total energy on the average.

56
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.200
So in other words, the expectation
value of the kinetic energy operator

57
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.510
is half that of the total energy,

58
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.450
which is equal to,</v>
One-half times one-half h bar

59
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.510
omega equal in the ground state.

60
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.430
Now, I want to make two comments about
this, the Virial Theorem very powerful.

61
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:42.140
So, first of all it actually applies to
any state E, the most arbitrary state

62
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.190
you can make of the harmonic oscillator,
including a time dependent wave packet.

63
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.620
Now, in that case,
this expectation value has

64
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.477
to be generalized,
meaning it's time averaged.

65
00:05:03.117 --> 00:05:07.920
But that makes it very useful and the next
to the last point to make on this for

66
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.130
the moment.

67
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.150
It's valid in any number
of the dimensions.

68
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.050
So, if you have an n dimensional
harmonic oscillator,

69
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.200
then you can just count
the contributions to the expectation

70
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.810
value of the kinetic energy from
each individual coordinate.

71
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.610
A last comment is that virial
theorems exist for other potentials,

72
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.330
but this case of the harmonic oscillator
is very special when we have this so

73
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.280
called equipartition of energy.

74
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.370
Between the kinetic and potential terms,
as we'll see later, the Virial Theorem for

75
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.170
the cool coolum problem,
or the hydrogen atom.

76
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.890
Also very useful,
is an entirely different form.

77
00:05:54.728 --> 00:05:58.310
So to recapitulate, if we take this
Gaussian as our trial function.

78
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.400
And just compute the expectations
out of the kinetic energy,

79
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.200
is half the total energy.

80
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.450
And it takes this form.

81
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.457
I've written it this way just to emphasize
there's a factor of a half out front,

82
00:06:13.457 --> 00:06:15.650
which is due to the levothym.

83
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.430
And this is the ground state energy
of the harmonic oscillator but

84
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.450
written in terms of
the characteristic length.

85
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.180
So you'll see expressions of this
frequently in quantum mechanics.

86
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.780
H bar squared over the squared
Planck's constant divided by mass and

87
00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.580
the square of a distance.

88
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.562
That's the, this is the energy

89
00:06:40.562 --> 00:06:46.002
of localized function.

90
00:06:46.002 --> 00:06:50.270
In other words, if you have a function
that's localized on link scale D,

91
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.340
then the characteristic motion,

92
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.800
the uncertainty principal based motion,
the average value of the kinetic energy.

93
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.680
Of that wave function is of the order
of h bar squared over 2mdÂ².

94
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.490
So if you remember
the correspondence of the Gaussian

95
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.900
with the harmonic oscillator ground state,
which I've just been emphasizing over and

96
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.870
over again in this part,
you don't have to do this interval again.

97
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.778
Having done it once,
you can use it forever.

98
00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:24.330
And keep in mind that it always has

99
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.830
a contribution that goes in the inverse
square of the characteristic length scale.

100
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:36.510
That means that as you try to compress a
wave packet, you raise its kinetic energy.

101
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.969
It's a manifestation of
the uncertainty principle again.

102
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.000
So, now let's see how this
works in a simple application.

103
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.736
Now, in one of the homework problems for
last week,

104
00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:55.900
there's a variational estimate of the
Attractive Dirac Delta function potential.

105
00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.278
Now, I can see from responses
on the student forums.

106
00:08:00.278 --> 00:08:05.390
That you know some of you have a lack of
familiarity with the direct delta function

107
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.980
which is fine.

108
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.010
Now I think there's a DLMF chapter.

109
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.575
A DLMF chapter.

110
00:08:15.575 --> 00:08:21.645
D-L-M-F Section 1.17 for

111
00:08:21.645 --> 00:08:24.900
the Dirac Delta.

112
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.300
I think that's very clearly and
accessibly written.

113
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.770
And the delta function is
the limit of a sequence.

114
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.719
You can think of a sequence of functions.

115
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:40.560
Let's say localized on the line.

116
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.550
Let's take this square well function on
the line of width a, and depth v naught.

117
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.650
And what you do is take
a sequence of such functions,

118
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.090
where a gets smaller and smaller.

119
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.350
And v naught gets larger and larger.

120
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.890
So that the product is preserved.

121
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.686
So, in fact, you can,

122
00:09:00.686 --> 00:09:05.700
if your having trouble with the concept
of the Dirac Delta function.

123
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.730
Just think of it in terms of a very
specific implementation like this,

124
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.890
and think of this as an approximation
of the delta function.

125
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.800
And if we use this as the approximation
of the delta function then,

126
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:26.410
by its definition, this potential here,
is equal to -V0a delta of x.

127
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:32.480
Because as you can see, when we perform
this integral of the potential,

128
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:38.250
what we get is the only contribution is
the product V0a with the negative sign.

129
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.069
Over that finite interval.

130
00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:47.329
Now we use the delta function, the delta
function is handy for sample applications.

131
00:09:47.329 --> 00:09:52.060
But it's widely used in practice
as sort of a pseudopotential for

132
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.600
representing information about
complex interactions between particle.

133
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.280
In terms of a single parameter.

134
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.450
And this is useful when the de
Broglie wavelength of the system,

135
00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.720
which is the characteristic wave length
of the quantum mechanic wave function.

136
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.818
That's h over p, is much,
much greater than the range,

137
00:10:12.818 --> 00:10:18.220
the range of interactions
that affect the function.

138
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.730
Let me give you just a simple concrete
example of that before proceeding.

139
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.770
Here we see a schematic
representation of a wavefunction for

140
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.950
an ultra cold atom system,
two atoms colliding.

141
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.800
And here is the quantum mechanical
wavefunction for two cases of bound in

142
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.430
a and a free state and
then this is the intermolecular potential.

143
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.690
And you see in this system,
there's a lot going on in the region of

144
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.940
close approach of the two atoms, and many,
many, many wiggles in the wave function.

145
00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.173
But in the application that's relevant,

146
00:10:58.173 --> 00:11:03.740
the application that's important,
in the discussion of this paper,

147
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:09.060
is the behavior of the wavefunction
at large distances from the atom.

148
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.550
And so, really the details of
what happens in this inner region

149
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:18.550
are only important insofar as it
affects the long range functionality

150
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:22.110
behavior of the wave function out here.

151
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:28.050
And so that behavior can be built
in by the use of a Delta function

152
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.190
in an internal region that
just sets the scale for

153
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:40.020
the evolution of the wave
function further out.

154
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.400
So lets go and complete the problem.

155
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:50.656
We're going to calculate the expectation

156
00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:55.179
value of age as a function of d.

157
00:11:58.454 --> 00:12:00.330
Using our trial function.

158
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:05.020
Okay, so we have,
we have this expression for

159
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.050
the kinetic energy,
it's h bar squared over 2m b squared.

160
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:12.631
So and
now let's just recall what it must be for

161
00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:17.590
the contribution for the potential energy.

162
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.470
Well all we need to do there.

163
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:27.645
Is when we integrate over the delta
function we just get minus v0a

164
00:12:31.605 --> 00:12:36.770
Times psi squared evaluated x equals 0.

165
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:37.730
Right?

166
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.427
Because that, the delta function,

167
00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:45.180
this takes a measure of the weight
on top of it at the origin.

168
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.720
And so psi squared x equal to zero,
is just d over the square root of pi.

169
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.480
So this gives us,
at small d a very repulsive,

170
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.000
in fact let's just plot
it out schematically.

171
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:02.050
This would be T.

172
00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.411
Now let me see if I can
change the color here.

173
00:13:11.869 --> 00:13:14.165
Yeah so now what about V?

174
00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:17.510
Well, V is minus one over D.

175
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:23.181
So that is negative here, and

176
00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:30.800
it falls off inversely
proportional to the potential.

177
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.410
So this is v.

178
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.781
So now let's look at the sum of the two.

179
00:13:41.838 --> 00:13:47.240
So the sum of the two,
it's positive at short distances,

180
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:54.800
but then it's got to become negative
at long distances so it turns over.

181
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.270
And so this,
this defines a point of minimum.

182
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:04.980
So you just have to find
the minimum as a function of d,

183
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:11.150
find the minimum value of this,
the sum of these two terms.

184
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:18.420
And that gives you the best
choice of the scale parameter.

185
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.362
To estimate the energy of
the attractive delta function.

186
00:14:22.362 --> 00:14:26.770
I want like to say that this
is the same minimization

187
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.270
that one encounters for
the hydrogen atom in three dimensions.

188
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.080
That is first of all, obviously,

189
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.740
the kinetic energy, the contribution of
the kinetic energy is always the same.

190
00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:40.275
And then if you think of it,

191
00:14:40.275 --> 00:14:45.612
well the hydrogen atom has you
know v of r goes as 1 over r.

192
00:14:45.612 --> 00:14:50.470
So it stands to reason that you'd have
an inverse length in the expectation value

193
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.060
for the potential energy.

194
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.190
And we'll see in the subsequent
part that that's the case.
