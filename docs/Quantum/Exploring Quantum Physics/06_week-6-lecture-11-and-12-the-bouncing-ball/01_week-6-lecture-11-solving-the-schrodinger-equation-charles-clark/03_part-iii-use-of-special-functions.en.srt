00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,420
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,030
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,510
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,156
We're now going to start to apply
some of the greatest tools that

5
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:16,151
mathematicians have ever developed,
the special functions, and

6
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:20,445
apply them to solving problems of
quantum mechanics of simple systems.

7
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:23,375
Now special functions,

8
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:27,305
there are many good sources of information
on special functions available.

9
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:30,225
But it's good to have
a common reference so

10
00:00:30,225 --> 00:00:32,639
that everyone in this course
will be using the same one.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,810
So we're using this, the digital
library of mathematical functions,

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,810
from my employer,
the National Institute of Standards and

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:45,130
Technology, it's a free app,
freely available worldwide, and

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,760
it contains information on all
the functions that we'll be using in

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,890
this course and many more, and well there
are many other things to be said about it.

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,030
But when I make a reference to
something like the Airy function,

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,650
which will be done later this part.

18
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:06,090
Then what I mean are the specific
representations that are provided there.

19
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,910
Which they're very much standard.

20
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,993
The same you'll find in Wikipedia but
I encourage you to look at this anyway.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,180
Two, several other resources for you.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,370
A short crash course on mathematics.

23
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,150
That's something that's certainly worth
looking at because it does provide

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,620
a constructed by Zach Rains and his
collaborators and gives you a pretty good

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,720
idea of the level of mathematical
treatment that's done in this course.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,390
Another one page guide

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,210
to the known solutions of the Schrodinger
equation in terms of special functions.

28
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,240
And what else, a sample.

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,240
A program written in spreadsheet form

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,290
for solving the Schroedinger
equation by numerical integration.

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,610
So that's something.

32
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,500
I won't be using that in this part,
but something worth looking at.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,360
There's a discussion there.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,847
And I'll give you some simple guides
as to how to numerically integrate

35
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:15,915
the Schroedinger equation in cases when
you're dealing with a complex problem for

36
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:17,619
which there is no known solution.

37
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,650
So, who was the first person
to use this approach?

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,200
Solving the Schrodinger equation
using special functions?

39
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,690
No prizes for getting this right,
it was in fact, Schrodinger.

40
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:40,510
And you might say that his first work,

41
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,568
first papers on the wave equation
were influential for several reasons.

42
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:51,390
But one lasting development was that it

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,510
cast the Schrodinger Equation of quantum
mechanics into a form that had been

44
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,690
well understood by in
classical mechanics and

45
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,410
that was to reduce the Schrodinger
equation, differential

46
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,390
equation that had solutions in terms of
functions that were known at the time.

47
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,630
So what Schrodinger,
what Schrodinger did of course,

48
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,960
the importance of his
work stands on its own.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,500
He explained the spectrum
of the hydrogen atom,

50
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,030
calculated the shifts in spectral lines.

51
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,720
He invented perturbation theory,
all the series of four remarkable papers.

52
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:37,090
But certainly it's very important for
the wider implementation of his ideas.

53
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,281
That, he developed a framework,
that mapped onto well

54
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:47,680
developed problems,
of classical mathematical physics.

55
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,497
And so
we're following the same approach here.

56
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,775
So in this part of the lecture,
we're going to look at three,

57
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:03,853
we're going to stick with
one-dimensional examples, and

58
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:09,028
we'll look at constant potential,
a linear potential, and

59
00:04:09,028 --> 00:04:14,400
I guess, it will be in the next part,
quadratic potential.

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,700
But you might say that these are the three
simplest possible potentials

61
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,020
in terms of development as polynomials.

62
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,400
And the solutions of
the Schrodinger Equation for

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,930
these cases are the exponential
function for

64
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,580
the constant potential, the Airy
function for the linear potential.

65
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,400
So this is exponential.

66
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:45,040
Airy and parabolic cylinder,
for the quadratic.

67
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,330
Now the harmonic is
a special case of that.

68
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,335
But we're going to go through,
in this part,

69
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:54,260
we're going to go through
these two cases and

70
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,217
try to infer from them some general
principles that are relevant both for

71
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:05,170
the analytical and numerical solution of
one-dimensional Schrodinger equations.

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,040
Right, so
let's start with the linear potential.

73
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,060
We just take V(x) to be a constant.

74
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,810
And so here's the Schrodinger equation.

75
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:22,030
Now, the point is we want to find
solutions for any value of the energy.

76
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,252
We want to find a general
solution valid for all energies.

77
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:29,597
Because then, with such solutions in hand,

78
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:35,770
we can find the particular solutions that
we need to satisfy boundary conditions.

79
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,235
You'll see why this is
important in a moment.

80
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:42,750
But for example, if we just consider
a case where the potential is

81
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:53,680
constant over different regions, constant
at different values and different regions.

82
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,030
And you want to find a solution
to a wave equation that is valid.

83
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,786
It'll be sufficient to have this
information so that you can piece,

84
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:06,066
you can stitch,
the various pieces together.

85
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:11,263
So, the approach we'd take is to transform

86
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:17,868
the Schrodinger Equation up
here into a standard type.

87
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:23,130
In this case,
the standard form that we see

88
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,430
is here where Rho is a scaled variable.

89
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,310
Dimensionless variable.

90
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:38,027
And then the plus or
minus sign has to do with whether energy

91
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,860
Positive or negative.

92
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,772
We know that energies can be any number on
the real line so we need to account for

93
00:06:50,772 --> 00:06:52,141
both of those cases.

94
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,130
Okay so we just take that system.

95
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,490
We transform,

96
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,860
we find the dimensionless variable
row is kx, k is the wave vector.

97
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,429
Depending on whether
the energy is greater than or

98
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:21,450
less than, the potential energy well this.

99
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,950
The value of k is determined by that.

100
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,520
And so there's two classes of solution.

101
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,820
So when e is greater than Vo,
we have two independent solutions.

102
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,660
So, let me just say again,
as a second order differential equation.

103
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,470
Any second order differential
equation like this one

104
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,990
has at least two independent solutions.

105
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,120
There are many different ways to
choose them but here I've just,

106
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,140
i've given you two independent solutions,
sin(rho) and the cos(rho).

107
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,800
We'll say a little bit more
about the choice momentarily.

108
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,460
And then in the region
where e is less than

109
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,950
V0, two independent solutions
can be chosen of this form,

110
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,880
e to the rho and e to the minus rho.

111
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,800
So any other solution that exists in this

112
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,060
region is going to be a linear
combination of these two functions.

113
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,430
But that means the generic
behavior is divergence.

114
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,670
Because if you just take a random
choice of these two functions,

115
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:45,010
then the resulting solution is going
to diverge as row goes to infinity.

116
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,230
And in the exceptional case where you just
choose this function then it diverges

117
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,710
and row goes to infinity.

118
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,450
Now that can be changed by
another boundary condition.

119
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,160
We have to be aware that in this, for

120
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,850
this particular circumstance,
the generic behavior is divergence.

121
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:12,867
So that means that you have difficult
choices that have to be made.

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,734
So I'll make two points about this, in
some sense trivial Schrodinger equation,

123
00:09:22,734 --> 00:09:27,830
which either has oscillatory,
or exponential solutions.

124
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,710
And that is, if you have a general
understanding of the solutions,

125
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,930
then you could do a piecewise
approximate solution, to a, to a real

126
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,000
potential, he had a real potential
that have some arbitrary shape.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,630
You can approximate it on
a piece-wise basis, and

128
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,240
then by knowing how to solve the equation
regions of constant potential

129
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,140
you can sort of propagate solutions
between different such regions.

130
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,070
This is something that's used in modeling
semiconductor heterostructure so

131
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:04,710
on the photonic band
gap materials are well

132
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,048
understood in terms of
having techniques for

133
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:16,110
it to propagate an away function across
a constant region and then to stitch the,

134
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,900
you know stitch the transition matrix
together to see what the net result is.

135
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,000
So actually,
why don't we just now apply that

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,990
approach to the simplest possible
problem of crossing an interface.

137
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,630
And we're going to look at
an example that you see every day.

138
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,760
If you look through a window,
you see a reflection of yourself.

139
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,300
I mean even if the glass is transparent
there is some reflection and so

140
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,330
it turns out that this
is a phenomenon that's

141
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:00,170
an example of this sort of the potential
step function in quantum mechanics.

142
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,390
So we have V(x) as a function of x.

143
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,130
This is air.

144
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,060
This is glass.

145
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:16,810
So the propagation of the light wave
as it enters a window is the same,

146
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,920
very similar mathematically to the problem
of particle moving in a potential.

147
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,947
So the way that that is framed
is that the we have light

148
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:33,340
incident from a large
distance of negative axis.

149
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,820
That wave function is
a form of e to the ikx.

150
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,970
Then there's a reflected
component which is a type

151
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,620
r with reflections
coefficient times my kx.

152
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,800
And then the transmitted coefficient here.

153
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:58,440
Now how do we, how do we determine
the effect of glass on light?

154
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,450
Let me refer you to an inline quiz.

155
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,670
So when light goes in to glass its

156
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:18,250
the refractive index of glass
is about 1.5 that means that

157
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,680
its wave length decreases and
so that is that means

158
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,440
the wave the wave equation spacial wave
equation in the interior as this form.

159
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,350
And so now it's very easy to
determine the reflexion coefficient.

160
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,990
So what we have, we have a wave
function on two sides of an interface.

161
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,160
The air in the glass.

162
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,590
So we have to match the values of
the wave function to the boundaries.

163
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,078
So for x = 0 it's very easy,
that's 1 + r here,

164
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:54,580
this t here, so
we have to have 1 plus r equals to t.

165
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,810
And then we match the derivatives,

166
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,180
that is the equation of continuity
that's require in quantum mechanics.

167
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,880
So once again it's easy to
differentiate this side and

168
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,629
the answer is Ik1 minus r and
this side is just ik and t.

169
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,825
And so now what do we do?

170
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:21,789
Well we divide,

171
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:28,608
we take this side.

172
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,080
And divide it by the other one.

173
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:43,650
So you see, I'm just taking this divided
by that, equals that divided by that.

174
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:49,230
Get this simple equation for
the reflectance coefficient.

175
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,140
So you see, the k the wave vector
disappears as does the transmission

176
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,945
coefficient, and that's easy to
invert this equation to get this, so

177
00:13:58,945 --> 00:14:06,210
R = -0.5 over 2.5 = one-fifth.

178
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:11,388
So the actual reflected
intensity's r squared

179
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:16,060
coefficient is 0.04, so it's 4%.

180
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,300
This is about right.

181
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,208
When you put light through a window,
normal instance about

182
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:27,070
4% is reflected.

183
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,760
So in the next part of this lecture
we're going to explore the next

184
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:37,830
sequence of, next to the sequence of
complexity, the linear potential.
