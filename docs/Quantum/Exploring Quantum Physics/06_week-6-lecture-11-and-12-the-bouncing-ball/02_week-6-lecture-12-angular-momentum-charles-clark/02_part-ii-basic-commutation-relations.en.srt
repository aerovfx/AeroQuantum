00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:02,790
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,090
Welcome back to Exploring Quantum Physics.

3
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:06,630
I'm Charles Clark, and

4
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,500
we'll now start using some of the tools
that we developed in the previous session

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,140
to get the basic commutation relations for
the angular momentum operators.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:25,360
Now once again I have to emphasize, and
I've been there myself, the only way

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,590
to develop facility with these
techniques is to actually practice them.

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,970
So, in the interest of time,
I'm going to outline a number of the key

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,250
things that have to be done to develop
a working set of angular momentum tools.

10
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,310
But really,

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,310
if you want to understand it it's not
going to do you good just to look at that.

12
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:52,960
You will have to do some
of the computations.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,360
And, for some people, those sorts of
calculations turn out to be enjoyable.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,760
Others can't stand them, so

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,380
you'll get a sense of what it's like and
some of you, I think, will not only

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,360
benefit from this but come to enjoy it and
value it, at least hope so.

17
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,372
Okay so, once again, here's the definition
of the angular momentum operator.

18
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,900
Now I break it down, and

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,650
so here's what we started with at
the beginning of the first part.

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,820
Here's the Einstein summation condition.

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,000
Here's the Einstein summation
condition with the levi-cicita symbol.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,940
By the way, I, here,
is the square root of minus one, and

23
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,800
I try to avoid using

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,910
I as a running index when we have
a square root of minus one present.

25
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,000
So just keep your eyes out for that.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,380
But there's no significance as
to whether the symbol's u, v,

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,470
w, a, b, c, d, e, f,

28
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:02,550
anything that appears here as
a running index, and the particular

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,959
choice of symbol that's used to represent
it is just something arbitrary.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,600
Now, in fact, everything that's going
to be done in this part is based on

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:20,400
the commutation relationship
between position momentum.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,760
But, as you can see,
when you have products, then there's a bit

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,860
of bookkeeping that's required to make
sure that everything turns out right.

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,502
So, just to start with
something very basic,

35
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:43,740
let's try a simple application of this
commutation relationship in Video Quiz.

36
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,708
Okay, so I hope you're able
to derive this expression

37
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:55,290
from the uncertainty principle.

38
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,259
We'll see many examples
like this later on.

39
00:03:02,838 --> 00:03:04,951
Here's our basic definition again,

40
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:08,060
just to keep everything clear
before you on the screen.

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,840
Here is the fundamental
commutation relation,

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,300
that which everything else is based.

43
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,250
Yes, now here is this identity
that you just derived.

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,861
So now, here's a very important
expression, what's the commutation

45
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:34,610
relation of the angular momentum with,
let's say, the position operator?

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,480
Well all right, here's computated LaXb,

47
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,440
that's just very simple
expressing what that means.

48
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,809
We now decompose the angular

49
00:03:51,809 --> 00:03:56,506
momentum operator into its

50
00:03:56,506 --> 00:04:01,421
basic parts, its r cross p.

51
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,671
Then we apply this,

52
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:09,643
from this expression up here,

53
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:16,143
we applied contraction and we get this,

54
00:04:16,143 --> 00:04:22,262
this is a very significant identity,

55
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:27,247
which you will see is generic.

56
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:34,190
In other words, if we have any
vector valued operator in here,

57
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,037
we have the same identity for
the momentum,

58
00:04:39,037 --> 00:04:44,800
we get this congregate LaXb
is h bar epsilon a b cXc.

59
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,780
I rather like expressing
that in this way because

60
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,040
it emphasizes the difference between
classical mechanics and quantum mechanics.

61
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,063
Do you see that, in classical mechanics,

62
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:02,888
this expression would vanish
identically because A cross B,

63
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:11,410
is equal to minus B cross A,
for classical operators.

64
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,810
So, here we have these two,
real observable operators,

65
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,400
the sum of these two cross products,
is an imaginary number times the vector.

66
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,850
So, this really is about
as quantum as it gets.

67
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,360
And indeed, note that the limit,
H bar goes to zero,

68
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,070
this produces the right answer,

69
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,850
in that you get back the same
classical cross product.

70
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,883
So, there are a number of identities
that you'll see that look like this,

71
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,173
in quantum mechanics.

72
00:05:47,318 --> 00:05:48,860
So once again, where are we?

73
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,500
Okay, we have the basic relations,
the one that you derived.

74
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,460
So, we're about to conclude here.

75
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,460
Strongly recommend that you
verify the following things.

76
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:13,630
So, for example, here's the analog, the
identity we proved on the previous slide,

77
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,750
with X we get the same type of thing for
P.

78
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,280
Now here's, sort of,
the most important one, the commutator of

79
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,277
the different components of
angular momentum with themselves,

80
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:31,880
again, is really of the same form,
because L is a vector.

81
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,650
So this allows us to write another,
amusingly, quantum expression.

82
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,020
The cross product of something with itself
is an imaginary number, times that thing.

83
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,188
So this is truly a quantum identity.

84
00:06:45,188 --> 00:06:50,780
And then finally,

85
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,220
so I'd say these two are more or
less the same thing.

86
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,130
But this is of central importance.

87
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,590
So any two components of
the angular momentum operator,

88
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:08,970
in general, they don't commute, but,

89
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,560
any component of the square of the angular
momentum operator, so L squared.

90
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,883
I should have written this as LkLk just so

91
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:25,120
as not to confuse you, or LaLa.

92
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,800
So let me just write this,
La LbLb equals 0,

93
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,860
is the identity that you're
being asked to verify.

94
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,463
In other words, that any component
of the angular momentum operator

95
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:51,710
commutes with the square magnitude
of the angular momentum operator.

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,680
Okay do take some time to work on those,
I think you'll find it rewarding.
