00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:04.530
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.560
Welcome back to exploring quantum physics.

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.200
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.350
And we're now going to look at
the angular momentum operator

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.350
in its role as an effective potential.

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.790
This is going to proceed from applying
some of the commutator identities

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.460
that you derived in the previous part.

8
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.158
So again, what we're doing

9
00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:34.920
here involves a fundamental derivation and

10
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.679
I just have to emphasis, if you really
want to benefit from this course

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.670
and learn something practical,
both about quantum physics and

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.680
with a lot of applications
to other types of analysis.

13
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.140
You have to work it out.

14
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.400
I mean, I can't force you to.

15
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.840
But it's time to decide whether
it's worth your while or not.

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.930
I'll have to say that I think
that when you complete this

17
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.410
derivation you will have done
something foundational and

18
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.390
you should see that it
has implications for

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.320
a lot of other physics problems that you
may have been working with in your career.

20
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.477
Electromagnetism, acoustics,
wave motion and the like.

21
00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:29.643
I'm just going to keep before
you the various identities

22
00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:34.782
of fundamental things
which we started with and

23
00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:40.960
things that we proved together,
or you proved offline.

24
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.334
Just try to keep these visible and
in mind so

25
00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:48.381
that you can get the results
from them that we need.

26
00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:57.961
The most important thing that we're
going to do in this part is to show

27
00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:02.445
the relationship of the angular
momentum operators, the L squared,

28
00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:04.580
to the kinetic energy operator.

29
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.130
Now you might anticipate that

30
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.270
there is such a thing because after
all L squared looks like this and

31
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.720
this is r cross p so there's a p
squared lurking in there somewhere.

32
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.700
Just how does that work out?

33
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.133
Well, once again we have.

34
00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:32.150
Here's the first.

35
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.613
Well here are the two components of the.

36
00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.430
Of the scale or product.

37
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.843
And I have taken the minus sign of
the h bar squared outside just so

38
00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:51.770
that were dealing with something that
just has the x's and the p's in.

39
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.984
Okay, and dq is.

40
00:02:59.607 --> 00:03:03.300
The expression for just in case that.

41
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.820
So unfamiliar to you.

42
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.600
Just helps simplify the notation.

43
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.289
Okay so
now we can pass through the levy chevita.

44
00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:20.064
And we're now back, then now we have

45
00:03:20.064 --> 00:03:24.534
the contraction identity because

46
00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:29.928
we're summing over these common indices

47
00:03:29.928 --> 00:03:34.858
i that came from the scalar product and

48
00:03:34.858 --> 00:03:40.730
now we apply the contraction
identities to.

49
00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:43.558
To these here.

50
00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:50.090
So in other words, this is just a straight
forward compression math symbol.

51
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.980
And then we're going to reduce this
further by using this identity

52
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.470
to move the x out from behind

53
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.426
out from in front of the derivative.

54
00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:13.578
Okay.

55
00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:19.359
So, yeah,
there's very little point in trying

56
00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.300
to follow a fast paced derivation there.

57
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.910
But starting from this, you should
be able to derive this identity.

58
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.000
Which shows that the angular
momentum is linked up

59
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.730
to the kinetic energy in
a rather profound way.

60
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.020
So, just to express that
in a more familiar form,

61
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.710
let's take the Hamiltonian for the motion
of a particle in a fixed potential.

62
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.840
And now we see the kinetic energy

63
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.970
can be written in this form where

64
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.102
R in our notation is like xa xxa.

65
00:05:21.185 --> 00:05:24.440
X a square root of x a.

66
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.570
The usual radius.

67
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:34.460
So, we get, we didn't actually
transform to spherical coordinates, but

68
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.260
there's a very natural development of the
expression of the square of the kinetic

69
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.500
energy the square of the angle momentum
operator brings us to this form where

70
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.310
the kinetic energy is now expressed
naturally in spherical polar

71
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.300
coordinates with L being an operator
of the max of those coordinates.

72
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.020
So that's how angular momentum
enters the Hamiltonian.

73
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.210
Thus if you think about
where this came from,

74
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.380
any time you have an equation with a
LaPlacian, you have something that's very

75
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:15.090
much like an angular momentum though
it may not be described in those terms.

76
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.921
So the various multiple
moments with electromagnetic

77
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:25.067
field correspond to angular momentum,
the same things,

78
00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:30.318
acoustics and fluid mechanics,
and a lot of the analytical

79
00:06:30.318 --> 00:06:35.840
techniques that we'll develop for
understanding.

80
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.950
L squared,
have applications in those areas as well.

81
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.600
The other very important point about this,

82
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.550
I said angular is more
powerful than gravity.

83
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.907
Well, gravity's pretty powerful but,
this basically we get

84
00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:58.480
a V effective which is proportional
to the L square over r squared.

85
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.190
So, this is one of these,
this is this inverse, this is

86
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:10.840
a part of the kinetic energy operator and
in the variational methods

87
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.410
section we saw that short distances
correspond to high kinetic energy.

88
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:23.600
So basically the angular momentum presents
a sort of an effective potential for to

89
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:30.090
particle motion that is
repulsive inverse square law.

90
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.490
And I'll just note that there's
a further generalization of this type of

91
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.730
approach can be made to
an n dimensional system.

92
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.800
And we're not going to do that here, but

93
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.420
it is something that is used in
practice for nuclear physics,

94
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.880
molecular collisions, and
sometimes atomic physics.

95
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.660
It is sometimes advantages
to have a fully symmetrized

96
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.450
system of coordinates
includes all particles.

97
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:09.740
And then one gets some implications

98
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.920
about short range behavior of
those systems from looking at the,

99
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.530
thinking of the Generalized angular
momentum has an effective potential.

100
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.540
Okay, so now we're going to conclude
this lecture with the description of

101
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.630
the relationship between the angular
momentum and the lens vector that was

102
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:34.930
discussed in the earlier
lectures on the hydrogen atom.

103
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.650
Hope to see you then.
