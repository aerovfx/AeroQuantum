00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.460
Hell everyone, welcome back to Exploring
Quantum Physics, I'm Charles Clark.

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.830
And now we're going to wrap up the

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.220
connection between the angular momentum of
the Runge-Lenz

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.170
Vector that we saw in a previous lecture,

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.889
and use that to describe the spectrum of
hydrogen.

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.640
So I hope you remember from lectures in
the past week, we derived

7
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.170
this new con, constant motion for the
hydrogen atom.

8
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.690
Unusual tide to run the lens vector, which
is really

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.090
the cross product, of the momentum and the
angular momentum.

10
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.610
And the radial vector, and this, this lies
in the same plane as

11
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.960
the, the radius.

12
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.630
Same plane as the position and the
momentum, classically.

13
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.840
And def-, defi-, it, it serves to define
the elliptical orbit that

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.559
the electron and the nucleus make about
the center of the mass.

15
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.090
Well, the classical definition is, is
asymmetric in p and L.

16
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.470
And precocious young scientist Wolfgang
Pauli, devised a symmetrised form.

17
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.190
And he's, he, he takes the mass out and,

18
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.770
and puts it in a different area.
So as you an see, this,

19
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.260
this m factor that Pauli that Pauli

20
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.773
derived, is identical up to an overall
constant to the

21
00:01:32.773 --> 00:01:38.640
Runge-Lenz Vector that we derived, but it
has a nice symmetric form.

22
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.060
That is required by quantum mechanics.

23
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.720
Well, I invite you to give your opinion on
that in the, in the video quiz.

24
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.000
Now, the central result found by Pauli,
and

25
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.290
it's, it seems mysterious and miraculous
to me.

26
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.830
It has to do with the commutators of

27
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.330
the angular momentum operator the run the
lens vector.

28
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.824
So you have already derived this, and
since

29
00:02:15.824 --> 00:02:21.050
since M is a vector valued operator it is,

30
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.874
it, it, you, this, this is this is a

31
00:02:25.874 --> 00:02:31.636
consequence, this is the, this is the
common

32
00:02:31.636 --> 00:02:36.326
commutator that applies when the angular

33
00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:41.180
momentum Operators apply to any vector.

34
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.280
But now here's the the new one.
And

35
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.750
I am not going to go through a

36
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.630
step by step derivation because it's a
lengthy one.

37
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.130
But

38
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.730
as you can see from a, from the, from the
mechanical point of view this just

39
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.720
involves it now involves the M.
The M has products of

40
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.300
p x p.
There are triples of momenta and, and

41
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.250
coordinates in his expressions.
so it's lengtly but, when it is done

42
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.810
this, this is the answer.

43
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.430
And as we'll see, these these identities
make it possible to find the bound

44
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.990
state energies of all solutions of the

45
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.550
hydrogen atom, without actually solving
the Schrodinger Equation.

46
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.350
Now, first I'm going to talk about the
spectrum

47
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.120
that's associated with the angular
momentum operator itself.

48
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.880
It's very important, and I'm going to
outline the

49
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.870
derivation here just because for, in the
interest of time.

50
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.470
But it's something that you can do
yourself.

51
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.560
I've done it.

52
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.580
And Zach has written, Zach Raines has
written

53
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.210
up some nice notes, that sort of take you
step

54
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.220
by step through that.

55
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.040
So the first, the first observation is
that since L3 and

56
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.660
L squared commute, and there's nothing
important about L3 here but

57
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.390
it's we know that, that L3, L1 and L2 do
not

58
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.560
mutually commute, though each one of them
commutes with L squared.

59
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.510
So we're going to pick, we just, by
convention

60
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.400
we pick L3 to be we're, we're going to,

61
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.040
we're going to make Eigenfunctions that
are Eigenfunctions, both of

62
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.510
l squared and of L3, because we can choose

63
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.420
to have Eigen functions that have both
those Eigenvalues simultaneously.

64
00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.040
So we'll call these by convention lm and
L3|lm.

65
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.540
Is

66
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.820
is, is just the eigenvalues denoted by
this.

67
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:14.990
Now, it will turn out that l is equal to
0, 1, 2, and so on, integer.

68
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:23.610
And then m is equal to minus l, minus l
plus 1, et cetera, up to

69
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.070
l, but for the moment, we'll just, we'll
just leave it undetermined like that.

70
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.160
Okay, now, in order to prove the spectral
property

71
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.530
this, this is the spectral property of the
eigenvalue operator.

72
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.870
It's relat-, it's straightforward to prove
it if you define these two operators.

73
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.890
L plus and l minus.

74
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.900
These are sort of like, they resemble, to
some

75
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.390
degree, the creation annihilation
operators

76
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.780
of the harmonic oscillator problem.

77
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.900
So, you can readily verify this identity.
Because, you know,

78
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.593
it, we're just saying you've previously
established that, for example, L3

79
00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:15.640
commutator L1 equal i h bar L2.

80
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.600
so it's, it's quite straightforward to
verify

81
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:26.040
that this, this identity, which

82
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.210
says for example when you, when you, when
you

83
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.480
go, when you apply, when you take this,
and you now say alright,

84
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.280
let's apply L plus or L minus to this lm.

85
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.560
Is it an eigenstate of L3?

86
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.320
And indeed it is.
But it has its

87
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.180
eigen, its, its, its eigenvalue of L3 is
increased by plus or minus 1

88
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.470
times h bar.
So, in other words if you, if you,

89
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.520
if you start, whatever this state may be,
Lm, if you start with Lm,

90
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.880
then you get a sequence.
So this is the value of L3 here.

91
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.510
You get a sequence of equally spaced
values of, of L3.

92
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.165
So the, this is an example of a

93
00:07:30.165 --> 00:07:34.816
ladder operator, that's somewhat analogous
to the creation/annihilation operator.

94
00:07:34.816 --> 00:07:38.195
it generates a sequence of Eigenstates
with equally-spaced Eigenvalues.

95
00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:47.969
Well the full analysis requires that this
this sequence terminate at some point.

96
00:07:47.969 --> 00:07:50.444
Because if L squared has a fixed value,

97
00:07:50.444 --> 00:07:53.894
that means there's a maximum value of the
maximum

98
00:07:53.894 --> 00:07:59.210
eigenvalue for any one of it's components.
And that,

99
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:05.170
that yields that analysis yields the
following result,

100
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:10.820
that the spectrum of the angular momentum
operator it's L squared.

101
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:18.840
The eigenvalues of the form l times l plus
1 where l is any nonnegative integer,

102
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:28.530
so zero to six, et cetera.
Now there's a widely used,

103
00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.620
system of eigenfunctions of the angular
momentum operator.

104
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.250
these are called spherical harmonics.

105
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:42.350
Here's a, here's an appropriate reference
for their properties.

106
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.560
And they're expressed in spherical
coordinates so basic, if

107
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.020
you have a func, a function in three
dimensional space

108
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.480
the, the spherical harmonics are used to
paramatize the angular dependance.

109
00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.740
So by convention this is, this is x3, the
z coordinant.

110
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.830
phi is the, is the as it moves the angle
theta, the conventional polar angle.

111
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.070
And here is a, an image that shows the

112
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:17.790
various the various so

113
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:23.630
for l equals 0, there's m equals 0 only.
For l equal 1 there's

114
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.790
m equal plus 1, 0, minus 1, and so on.
Now

115
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.660
I think it's useful to keep in mind that
Ylm

116
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:42.124
is, is basically a polynomial.
Of

117
00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:48.606
degree

118
00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:52.180
l, divided by r to the l.
So all, all

119
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.260
these, these functions, I mean, their,
their expressions

120
00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.740
can get pretty complicated, but you can
always think of them as polynomials.

121
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:06.522
So for example, Y 0 is 1 over root 4 pi.

122
00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:10.279
It's just a constant, it's just a constant
function.

123
00:10:10.279 --> 00:10:15.583
y 1 0 and minus 1 are Well,

124
00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:20.479
y one zero, is proportional

125
00:10:20.479 --> 00:10:25.375
to cosine theta, which is,

126
00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:30.679
so it's proportional to c o for

127
00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:35.779
all r, and y 1 plus or minus 1

128
00:10:35.779 --> 00:10:41.083
are proportional to x plus

129
00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:46.203
or minus iy over r.
So they're they're,

130
00:10:46.203 --> 00:10:50.628
the, the things that, the most problems
you encounter just deal

131
00:10:50.628 --> 00:10:55.053
with fairly small values of l, whereas the
the the spherical

132
00:10:55.053 --> 00:10:59.904
harmonic functions are rather simple, but
they're very powerful sets.

133
00:10:59.904 --> 00:11:05.930
And they're often, they're widely used in,
in many

134
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:12.044
applications in physics and mathematical
analysis.

135
00:11:12.044 --> 00:11:18.366
Now, it turns out, to get back to the the
angle Runge-Lenz

136
00:11:18.366 --> 00:11:23.236
vectors.
These operators, L and M together, let's

137
00:11:23.236 --> 00:11:28.728
just think about the balance states of
either for the motion.

138
00:11:28.728 --> 00:11:32.018
Together, they're the generation, they
provide the

139
00:11:32.018 --> 00:11:35.135
generators of a rotation proof in four
dimensions.

140
00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:37.340
So, the hydrogen

141
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.338
atom, has an internal symmetry, which

142
00:11:42.338 --> 00:11:47.483
is like the symmetry of an object that has
a

143
00:11:47.483 --> 00:11:53.069
particular transformation under rotations

144
00:11:53.069 --> 00:11:58.312
in a space of four spacial divisions.

145
00:11:58.312 --> 00:12:02.344
it's quite extraordinary that such a deep

146
00:12:02.344 --> 00:12:04.626
relationship exists.

147
00:12:04.626 --> 00:12:07.380
Now I don't think it's possible in, to

148
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:11.368
make a interpretation of that fourth
spacial dimension.

149
00:12:11.368 --> 00:12:15.784
That's something that exists like one of
the three spacial dimensions with which

150
00:12:15.784 --> 00:12:20.646
we're familiar.
But it is striking that this, this very

151
00:12:20.646 --> 00:12:27.480
basic dynamical system, the hydrogen atom,
the simplest atom, has this very

152
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:33.051
rich and symmetric structure with a high
degree of degeneracy.

153
00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:38.157
So for for a given, for a given

154
00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:43.019
value of, of principal quantum number.

155
00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:48.227
Let's say N is equal to n, n plus

156
00:12:48.227 --> 00:12:53.375
l plus 1.
There are

157
00:12:53.375 --> 00:12:59.717
N squared states

158
00:12:59.717 --> 00:13:04.700
with the same

159
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.850
energy.
So this degeneracy

160
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.926
receives, I think, spectacular
confirmation in this data for

161
00:13:14.926 --> 00:13:19.737
the molecular cloud that we saw in an
earlier lecture.

162
00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:25.785
So this frame shows absorption by states

163
00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:31.991
in a molecular cloud with an N value of
600.

164
00:13:31.991 --> 00:13:37.841
And the, there are, there are basically,
something like 300 and,

165
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:44.960
for, for, in this region there are 350,000
states with the same energy.

166
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.490
And there, well there are 350,000 states
in

167
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:53.830
this vicinity and you see sharp lines here

168
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.810
and these are, according to our best
understanding

169
00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.690
of the system, those states are all
equally populated.

170
00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.070
So you're seeing the sharp ringing.

171
00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:04.680
All of these hundreds of thousands of
states

172
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:08.020
are making transitions at exactly the same
frequency.

173
00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.370
It is really, it's really quite a
remarkable thing.

174
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:16.370
Indeed, without this high degeneracy of
the these are actually

175
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:22.790
carbon like atoms with a with highly
excited electrons that are hydrogenic.

176
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.560
Without that exact degeneracy, we wouldn't
see these signals at all.

177
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.990
So we're going to conclude for the moment
there, and

178
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:36.210
then proceed in the next lecture with some
discussion

179
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.170
of more applications of angular vectors.
Hope to see you then.
