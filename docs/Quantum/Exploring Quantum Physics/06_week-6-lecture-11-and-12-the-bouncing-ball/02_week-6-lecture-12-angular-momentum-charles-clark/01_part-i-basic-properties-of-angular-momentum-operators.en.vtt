00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:01.700
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.360
Welcome back to exploring quantum physics.

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.430
I'm Charles Clark.

4
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.370
And this lecture is going
to discuss the theory and

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.840
applications of angular momentum.

6
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.361
Very important concept in quantum physics,
and one that in some sense

7
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:21.665
defines a larger framework within
which we look at many problems.

8
00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:29.410
You might say, everything revolves
around angular momentum, joke, get it?

9
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.225
But it is in fact a very
important framework, and

10
00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.260
I'll just draw your attention to random
example from the additional materials

11
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.601
section under the title,
Atomic clocks and quantum computers.

12
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.580
This is a figure from a paper
written by David Wineland,

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.620
who won the Nobel Prize
in Physics last year.

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.200
And it's a visionary paper that describes
the relationship between atomic clocks and

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.980
quantum computers and
actually provided a roadmap for

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.970
the development of the first practical
quantum computing device, as I see it,

17
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.550
which was this optical clock
based on the aluminium ion.

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.240
Now, what you see here is
a schematic of two atomic

19
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.920
energy level structures, and they're given
a number of these very precise labels.

20
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.870
It's only like five halves, it's not
like 2.6, it's exactly five halves.

21
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.400
So there are these various
quantum numbers, and

22
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.440
I don't expect you to necessarily
recognize these right now.

23
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.730
But these all are developed
on the basis understanding of

24
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.240
the conservation of angular momentum in
quantum systems and its quantization.

25
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.430
And this is extremely important,
it underpins everything,

26
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.350
atomic clocks, the operation of magnets
at a fundamental level, and so on.

27
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.492
So in this lecture,
we're going to go through some of

28
00:02:00.492 --> 00:02:06.324
the fundamental techniques that
are required to develop and

29
00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:12.058
use the theory of angular momentum and
quantum mechanics.

30
00:02:13.997 --> 00:02:17.962
So, in particular, we're going to derive
a number of foundational properties of

31
00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:20.350
angular momentum operators.

32
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.400
And I'm going to introduce
something that is pretty standard

33
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.860
set of procedures for tensor calculus.

34
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.753
They're very useful in developing
a practical understanding of how you

35
00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:37.270
deal with angular momentum algebra.

36
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.780
And so,
some of you may be familiar with these.

37
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.640
In that case,

38
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.245
the first few parts of this lecture
might be sort of a review or tutorial.

39
00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:53.100
Using approach was first
developed by Albert Einstein, and

40
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.290
it seems at first like just sort
of a notational innovation, but

41
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.990
it has a lot of important
practical consequences.

42
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.536
And this is useful in
many areas of physics.

43
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:10.776
Now for the sake of simplicity,
we're going to use vector notation, but

44
00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:13.450
all the symbols denote operators.

45
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.450
So in other words, the angular momentum
in classical mechanics is this object.

46
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.470
And we saw its significance in
the context of the classical theory,

47
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.640
the hydrogen atom earlier.

48
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.000
So now we're treating it as, well,

49
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.440
let's say, a vector valued operator,
so it has three components, right?

50
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.808
Lz = xPy- yPx, and

51
00:03:40.808 --> 00:03:46.384
then there's an Ly and

52
00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:49.910
an Lx as well.

53
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.401
But these are now to be interpreted in
terms of the quantum mechanical operators.

54
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.570
So, I'm going to switch notation
because as it turns out,

55
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.020
it's much easier to do calculations
when you don't have different

56
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.076
symbols for coordinates, but
you just have a different subscript.

57
00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:19.950
So hereafter, we're going to use
a convention x1, x2, and x3 for

58
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.210
the coordinates and then for the unit
vectors e1, e2, and e3, but occasionally,

59
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.830
when they lapse and switch back.

60
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.315
Okay, so now, the first thing
that you should take a note of,

61
00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:38.114
this is going to become
important in the derivations,

62
00:04:38.114 --> 00:04:43.062
is to use the Einstein summation
convention for repeated indices.

63
00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:47.720
This is something that was actually
first pointed out by Einstein.

64
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.600
And he said, well, he noticed there
were lots of expressions of this type.

65
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.050
Here's the scalar product of two vectors,
a and b, which in our new notation,

66
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:05.020
we would write these as sum of ai bi.

67
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.364
And what Einstein noted
is that you can just,

68
00:05:08.364 --> 00:05:13.031
in cases like that,
you can just cross out the summation sign.

69
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:25.282
And so,
whenever you encounter an expression

70
00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:29.874
of this type, you implicitly,

71
00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:36.258
Sum over a repeated index.

72
00:05:40.555 --> 00:05:47.462
That saves the presence of having
large numbers of summations signs.

73
00:05:47.462 --> 00:05:52.510
Now you do have to be
careful when you do this, but

74
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.068
that's why we're going to
engage in some practice.

75
00:05:58.068 --> 00:06:06.130
Another tool,
That's the third of these tools.

76
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.890
Really useful is the Levi-Civita symbol.

77
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.645
So this has three subscripts,
and it takes the values,

78
00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:22.299
+1, -1, or 0, according to whether in

79
00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:27.808
the first instance,
if the symbols ijk are a cyclic or

80
00:06:27.808 --> 00:06:32.350
even permutation of the symbols, 123.

81
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.260
So you can see, okay, 123,
if you shift that back

82
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.060
with a revolving
displacement of the index,

83
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:48.750
it goes to 231, shift it back again, it's
312, then again, it returns to itself.

84
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.256
The odd permutations
are those which involve just

85
00:06:55.256 --> 00:06:59.525
a transposition of two elements, so 123,

86
00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:04.238
if you switch 1 and 2,
you get 213, and so on.

87
00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:09.755
So the Levi-Civita symbol is -1 in cases

88
00:07:09.755 --> 00:07:15.118
like that, and then it's 0 otherwise,

89
00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:19.715
meaning when, for example, two or

90
00:07:19.715 --> 00:07:26.923
more of the indices, Are the same.

91
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.597
So in other words,
it vanishes unless every one of these,

92
00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:38.105
every value of the index is present.

93
00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:46.385
So now the end video quiz will ask
you to construct the vector cross

94
00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:51.339
product using some of the tools
that we've just described.

95
00:07:53.846 --> 00:07:59.103
So that example just showed you
how you can use the Einstein

96
00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:04.253
convention Levi-Civita symbols and
the index system to

97
00:08:04.253 --> 00:08:09.509
conveniently do standard
procedures of vector algebra,

98
00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:15.317
which you'll find useful in
electromagnetism and mechanics.

99
00:08:15.317 --> 00:08:21.993
And we'll make use of such examples
in further discussion here.

100
00:08:21.993 --> 00:08:30.061
Now finally, there's a very important
contraction identity of this form, so,

101
00:08:33.068 --> 00:08:36.829
All I can say is look at this carefully.

102
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:41.557
Here's the Einstein summation convention,
and you see there's what we call it

103
00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:46.480
a contraction identity because there's
a duplication of two of the indices.

104
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.646
When that happens, it turns out
that you can reduce this product of

105
00:08:51.646 --> 00:08:56.720
Levi-Civita symbols to the sum
of products of delta functions,

106
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.166
chronic or delta,
which has the following definition.

107
00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.430
I think you're all familiar with that.

108
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:09.526
Delta ij is equal to 1 if i is equal to j,
and 0 otherwise.

109
00:09:09.526 --> 00:09:12.506
And I think it would be,

110
00:09:12.506 --> 00:09:18.020
it's probably a good idea for
you to pause.

111
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.471
And just look at this and

112
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:25.586
run a few examples to convince
yourself that it's true.

113
00:09:28.302 --> 00:09:32.705
So just to put everything together,
with one example,

114
00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:37.740
let's take something from
classical vector calculus.

115
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.161
A cross the quantity B cross C,

116
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:46.831
something that rises very
often in applications.

117
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:51.916
And so,
here we use the summation convention,

118
00:09:55.397 --> 00:09:57.151
And the Levi-Civita.

119
00:10:01.494 --> 00:10:06.654
And then, so here we have a second,
here we see this

120
00:10:06.654 --> 00:10:12.543
pair of Levi-Civita symbols
come in the full expansion.

121
00:10:12.543 --> 00:10:17.868
And basically, what we're doing here,
we're getting down to sort of

122
00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:23.651
the most fundamental reduction of this
quantity in terms of its components.

123
00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:25.694
So that's this.

124
00:10:25.694 --> 00:10:30.705
And now we see that we can apply

125
00:10:30.705 --> 00:10:37.530
the contraction identity thusly.

126
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.382
And we've end up.

127
00:10:39.382 --> 00:10:43.580
I think you want to, good idea for

128
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.711
you to look at this and follow it through

129
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:54.776
offline that we get
the famous BAC-CAB rule,

130
00:10:54.776 --> 00:11:01.650
which is often used for
resolving vector products.

131
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.080
Okay, this is very much a methodological
part of the lecture, so

132
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.980
hope you'll review what you've learned.

133
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.220
And then we're going to,
in the next few parts of the lectures,

134
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.010
start applying this to develop important
information about angular momentum.

135
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.590
Hope to see you again.
