00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,560
Hi everyone. 
Today we'll resolve the paradox posed by 

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,910
the so called anomalous Zeeman effect in 
atomic spectroscopy, by looking at the 

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:10,110
consequences of having both orbital and 
spin angular momentum at play in the 

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,222
atomic electron Hamiltonian. 
But first I want to tell you a little bit 

5
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:19,342
more about spin and its interaction with 
magnetic fields. 

6
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:24,205
First, let's review the elements of our 
theory of electron spin. 

7
00:00:24,205 --> 00:00:27,743
The spin vector components are 
represented as operators by the two by 

8
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:32,511
two Pauli matrices. 
In direct analogy to orbital angular 

9
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:37,339
momentum, the square of the total spin is 
h bar squared times the half integer spin 

10
00:00:37,339 --> 00:00:43,780
quantum number, little s, times s plus 1. 
Eigenvalues of the individual components 

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,390
are simply the spin magnetic quantum 
number, m sub s. 

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,020
Times the quantum of action h bar. 
In a magnetic field along z, we have a 

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,501
trivial 2 by 2 Hamiltonian whose 
eigenvalues are given by the diagonal 

14
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:59,284
elements. 
With corresponding eigenvectors which are 

15
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:03,019
purely one spin component or the other. 
We see that the first moves up in energy 

16
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:06,724
which we expect from a magnetic moment 
pointed anti-parallel to the magnetic 

17
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:10,445
field. 
Because of spin angular momentum and its 

18
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,705
magnetic moment or antiparallel, however, 
this corresponds to spin parallel to the 

19
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:17,500
field. 
And so we call it spin up. 

20
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,430
The other moves down in energy, 
consistent with a magnetic moment 

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,920
parallel to the field, which has angular 
momentum opposite to the field. 

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,110
It can be called spin down. 
Note that we can compactly represent the 

23
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,510
eigen energies by this simple function of 
the spin magnetic quantum number, m sub 

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:43,440
s. 
We can use the stationary states of the 

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,455
simple spin Hamiltonian to calculate the 
state evolution of a spin in a magnetic 

26
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:52,417
field in which it is not in eigenstate. 
For example, let's say we prepare a spin 

27
00:01:52,417 --> 00:01:56,273
as an eigenstate of Sx. 
For example, by placing it in a magnetic 

28
00:01:56,273 --> 00:01:59,384
field long x and waiting for slow 
relaxation processes that we ignored in 

29
00:01:59,384 --> 00:02:03,740
our Hamiltonian, to take the system to 
its lowest energy state. 

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,094
For a magnetic field along the negative x 
direction, that's the state with a 

31
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:14,800
positive eigen value of S X. 
The ket labeled plus. 

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,300
Now, let's suddenly rotate the magnetic 
field along Z. 

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,784
The state is not a eigen state of the new 
Hamiltonian, but we can decompose it into 

34
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:26,490
a super position of eigen states that 
diagonalize the Hamiltonian. 

35
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,703
And which each evolve in time with a 
different complex exponential given by 

36
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:33,672
its energy. 
We can now use this to determine how the 

37
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:37,530
expectation value of spin along x changes 
with time. 

38
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,900
We simply sandwich the operator by the 
state. 

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,995
Remembering to not only transpose but 
also complex conjugate the bra on the 

40
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:48,600
left converting it from a column vector 
to a row vector. 

41
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,050
The result is a quantity which oscillates 
in time. 

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:58,931
But how is spin conserved then? 
If s x is changing, where does the spin 

43
00:02:58,931 --> 00:03:03,694
go? 
By calculating the expectation value of 

44
00:03:03,694 --> 00:03:08,406
spin along the y direction, s y we see 
that it too is oscillating in time, 90Â° 

45
00:03:08,406 --> 00:03:15,540
out of phase with spin along x. 
This is simply the quantum mechanical 

46
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,560
version of a process we are all familiar 
with, the Larmor precession of an object 

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,650
with angular momentum subject to a 
torque, such as a gyroscope. 

48
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,180
In this classical example, it's a 
mechanical torque due to gravity. 

49
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,156
Whereas the spin undergoes procession due 
to a mechanic, magnetic torque, caused by 

50
00:03:34,156 --> 00:03:40,080
a magnetic moment in a magnetic field. 
Note that the procession frequency is 

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,110
controlled by the Zeeman splitting from 
magnetic field magnitude. 

52
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,782
This field control over spin procession 
Larmor frequency is precisely how we can 

53
00:03:48,782 --> 00:03:52,140
spacially image using magnetic resonance 
imaging. 

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,450
Powerful electromagnets are used to 
create strong magnetic fields and field 

55
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,537
gradients. 
So that only a small volume will the 

56
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:03,194
Zeeman splitting that corresponds to a 
resonant exotation from narrow band radio 

57
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:08,009
frequency electromagnetic waves. 
This selective auscultation is then 

58
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,370
sensed by inductive detectors. 
Pickup coils. 

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,416
By scanning the resonance slice around in 
space by changing the electromagnetic 

60
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,250
coil currents. 
Images of deeply buried structures are 

61
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,365
created. 
MRI works by acting on the spin of the 

62
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:25,790
nuclei, not electrons. 
Which is enabled by the much smaller 

63
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,130
nuclear magneton due to much larger mass 
of the nuclei. 

64
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:36,850
And correspondingly small zamon energies 
and radio frequencies for excitation. 

65
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,546
Although impractical for imaging human 
biology, electrons spin resonance at 

66
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:44,520
around 20 gigahertz per tesla for the 
free electron. 

67
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,875
Is, however, very useful for study of 
inanimate samples, such as organic 

68
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:52,514
molecules and solid state materials. 
Now we can get back to the issue of 

69
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:58,430
anomalous Zeeman effect of atomic spectra 
in a magnetic field. 

70
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,236
Both the orbital and spin angular 
momentum of the electron have magnetic 

71
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:04,580
moments which couple to the magnetic 
field. 

72
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,399
But as we saw, the relativistic nature of 
the spin makes inclusion of a non-unity 

73
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,200
Thomas G factor necessary. 
We can of course, diagonalize the 

74
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,880
Hamiltonian, and determine the Zeeman 
splitting for each term separately. 

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,935
But how do we go about diagonalizing this 
expression with vectors l and s, that 

76
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:24,768
are, in general, not parallel? 
The key is to notice that the total 

77
00:05:24,768 --> 00:05:30,754
angular momentum, l plus s, is conserved. 
We expect that the energetic splitting 

78
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:35,040
will be on the same form as before, but 
with an effective g factor. 

79
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,161
Let's see how this works out. 
First we project both vectors onto the 

80
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:43,717
conserved angular momentum axes by taking 
the inner product with the unit vector 

81
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:49,430
along j l plus s. 
For a magnetic field along z, this then 

82
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,720
picks out the z component of j, which has 
eigenvalues h bar times total magnetic 

83
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,666
quantum number, m sub j. 
Carrying out the dot product yields an 

84
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:02,498
expression that is mostly known 
quantities in terms of the individual 

85
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:06,472
quantum numbers. 
But what's the dot product between the 

86
00:06:06,472 --> 00:06:11,237
spin and the orbital angular momentum? 
This can be seen by once again looking at 

87
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:20,799
the conserve quantity, j squared. 
Substituting this quantity into our 

88
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:24,920
Hamiltonian entirely converts it into a 
scalar energy quantity. 

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,214
Which is proportional to the magnaton 
times the magnetic field times the 

90
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:32,570
magnetic quantum number, m sub j. 
With the coefficient out front, it 

91
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,160
depends on little l, s and j. 
This is the so called Lande G-factor. 

92
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:45,150
Here's a few useful examples. 
When the orbital quantum number is zero. 

93
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,810
We just have the magnetic field 
interacting with the spin. 

94
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,410
Which we know has a g factor of two. 
Lande correctly predicts this. 

95
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,354
For l equals one, the total angular 
momentum j can be one plus one half, 

96
00:06:57,354 --> 00:07:01,781
three halves. 
Or minus one half, yielding one half. 

97
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,880
In the first case, the Lande G-factor is 
four thirds. 

98
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,830
And in the second, two thirds. 
So from the six l equals one states, 

99
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,630
that's three orbital projections times 
two spin projections. 

100
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:18,164
Four of the j equal to three halves 
states, where m sub j is minus three 

101
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:22,194
halves minus one half plus one half and 
plus three halves, have one G factor and 

102
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:25,914
the two remaining, j is equal one half 
states with m sub j equal to plus and 

103
00:07:25,914 --> 00:07:32,680
minus one half have another G factor of 
half its value. 

104
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,430
In a magnetic field, the six split like 
this. 

105
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,160
Now, let's look at transitions to the l = 
0 derived states. 

106
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,844
The selection rules with Landau Spin 
Orbit Coupling are analogous to the 

107
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:49,922
orbital selection rules. 
Changes in quantum number j, are plus or 

108
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:54,794
minus 1, and changes in the total 
magnetic quantum number, m sub j are 0 

109
00:07:54,794 --> 00:08:00,540
and plus 1 or minus 1. 
This means that only the four j equal 

110
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,260
three halves states can radiatively 
transition to the j equals one half 

111
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:08,608
states. 
And only the m sub j equal to plus or 

112
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:16,420
minus one half states can transition to 
both l equals zero states. 

113
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,578
This leaves six distinct transitions. 
The energy of the spectroscopic shifts 

114
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:26,274
that we observe by, by dispersing the 
emitted photos through the spectrometer 

115
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:29,970
are proportional to the difference in the 
products of lambda g factor times the 

116
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:36,380
total magnetic quantum number m sub j for 
initial and final states. 

117
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,400
We can now see how multiplates more than 
the Lorenz triplet are created. 

118
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,250
In this example, spectral, spectroscopic 
line splits into six in a magnetic field. 

119
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,598
Each separated by two thirds of the 
[UNKNOWN] splitting, an all line shift 

120
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:53,400
with magnetic field. 
It is this spin orbit coupling, that 

121
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,470
explains the Anomalous Zeeman effect.
