1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.460
So now that we understand some of the 
experimental and theoretical 

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.475
underpinnings of electron spin, we're 
going to be looking at today at effective 

3
00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:12.624
interactions between spins. 
Our goal here is to show how ordered spin 

4
00:00:12.624 --> 00:00:16.046
states, like ferromagnets, or spin 
imbalance, spin polarization and 

5
00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:20.015
equilibrium arise, especially in the 
solid state. 

6
00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:22.895
We'll first review the symmetry 
constraint on the two particle fermion 

7
00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:26.303
wave function and see how spin degrees of 
freedom are coupled through electrostatic 

8
00:00:26.303 --> 00:00:30.156
interactions. 
And then we'll look at a generic 

9
00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:33.376
Hamiltonian where this so called exchange 
interaction is relevant, leading up to a 

10
00:00:33.376 --> 00:00:37.510
quasi infinite system of coupled spins as 
a model for ferromagnets. 

11
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.190
As you've heard in professor Galiski's 
earlier lectures A system of two 

12
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.592
indistinguishable particles must yield 
the same measurement of electron 

13
00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:49.048
probability distribution regardless of 
how the two sets of quantum numbers 

14
00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:53.097
apply. 
To the first, and then second, or 

15
00:00:53.097 --> 00:00:56.350
vice-versa. 
This means that particle exchange implies 

16
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.460
the acquisition of a unit amplitude 
complex phase. 

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.988
And two distinct phases we see most often 
in nature are zero and pi, giving an 

18
00:01:03.988 --> 00:01:08.250
overall coefficient of plus one or minus 
one. 

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.218
These correspond to bosons and fermions 
with integer or half integer spin 

20
00:01:12.218 --> 00:01:17.220
respectively. 
Electrons are spin one half fermions, and 

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.000
so, acquire the negative spin upon 
particle permutation. 

22
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.880
For a two electron system, a convenient 
normalized real space wave function 

23
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.354
satisfying this constraint is given here. 
Switching coordinates r1 and r2 is the 

24
00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:34.469
same as multiplying times minus one. 
However, there is more to the electrons 

25
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.420
degrees of freedom than just it's 
coordinates. 

26
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.304
The total wave function is the product. 
Of this spacial wave length with a spin 

27
00:01:42.304 --> 00:01:46.558
wave function constructed from up and 
down single particle states. 

28
00:01:46.558 --> 00:01:51.250
The spatially antisymmetric function must 
therefore have a spin symmetric wave 

29
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.011
function of which there are 3 possible 
orthogonal states having definite amounts 

30
00:01:56.011 --> 00:02:01.500
of spin projections with the spin amount 
of 0 minus 1. 

31
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.190
These three states are therefore called a 
spin triplet. 

32
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.088
If we have a spatially symmetric wave 
function, then the spin wave function 

33
00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:11.813
must be anti-symmetric. 
There's only one way to do this with 

34
00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:17.520
definite total spin along the z-axis. 
A single state with zero total spin. 

35
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.732
This is called the spin singlet. 
Note that for all these states if one of 

36
00:02:21.732 --> 00:02:25.428
the 2 spends is flipped we necessarily 
change the spin wave function symmetry, 

37
00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:30.400
and in turn must change the spacial 
permutation symmetry as well. 

38
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.487
Now the point we're going to make is that 
these 2 totally antisymmetric states with 

39
00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:39.770
different spin and spacial symmetries 
have different energies. 

40
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.960
Let's take an example like the two 
electron, neutral helium atom. 

41
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.080
There's the usual electron nucleus 
attractive Coulomb interaction for each 

42
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.665
of the two electrons independently. 
But then there's the repulsive Coulomb 

43
00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:55.600
between the electrons themselves which 
involves both coordinates. 

44
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.964
Importantly there are no explicit spin 
spin interactions in the Hamiltonian. 

45
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.160
So let's evaluate the energy associated 
with these wave functions of different 

46
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.128
symmetry. 
Note that the only difference here is the 

47
00:03:09.128 --> 00:03:14.220
sign between the product states. 
Calculating the expectation value of the 

48
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.340
energy, the diagonal matrix elements of 
the hamiltonian gives us many terms. 

49
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.972
For instance, there are 4 terms related 
to intergrals over the part of the 

50
00:03:22.972 --> 00:03:26.597
[UNKNOWN] covering electron nucleus 
[UNKNOWN] interaction of the first 

51
00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:32.610
electrion h1. 
4 for the second electrion h2. 

52
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.820
And then the electron, electron repulsion 
term h12. 

53
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.853
Since H one and H two terms are dependent 
on variables R one and R two exclusively, 

54
00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:46.100
the cross-terms in distributing 
multiplication in the integrals vanish. 

55
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.254
For instance, in this one. 
Since H one depends only on R one, the R 

56
00:03:50.254 --> 00:03:55.324
two integral can be done separatley. 
But the way functions are orthogonal so 

57
00:03:55.324 --> 00:04:01.594
the R two integrals vanish. 
The same happens for the cross terms in 

58
00:04:01.594 --> 00:04:06.687
the h2 integrals. 
However, h12 depends on both coordinates 

59
00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:10.032
r1 and r2. 
So this procedure cannot be carried out, 

60
00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:13.583
in the cross terms remain along with the 
symmetric and anti-symmetric, plus and 

61
00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:18.625
minus sign. 
These are known as exchange integrals, 

62
00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:24.020
and we can write the energy of the wave 
function as the following. 

63
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.862
The plus is for the spacially symmetric 
and minus if for the spacially 

64
00:04:26.862 --> 00:04:30.900
anti-symmetric wave function. 
This exchange integral J splits the 

65
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.116
energies of two particle states that are 
distinct only by the spin configuration 

66
00:04:35.116 --> 00:04:39.332
By an effective interaction, due to the 
spacial and spin wave function total anti 

67
00:04:39.332 --> 00:04:45.260
symmetry constraint. 
Now you might ask why did we neglect 

68
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.950
direct spin spin interaction terms in our 
Hamiltonian. 

69
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.214
The underlying electrostatic route of 
exchange energy between spins is far 

70
00:04:54.214 --> 00:04:57.189
greater than any direct spin spin 
interaction. 

71
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.010
This magnetostatic energy is due to one 
magnetic moment's zamon energy in the 

72
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.258
field of another, which we know from 
classical E&M, falls off as 1 over 

73
00:05:05.258 --> 00:05:10.308
distance cubed. 
Using the characteristic values of Bohr 

74
00:05:10.308 --> 00:05:13.324
magneton and Bohr radius, we find the 
energy precisely the same as the 

75
00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:16.912
interaction scale between the intrinsic 
electron spin, and the orbital moment of 

76
00:05:16.912 --> 00:05:22.437
an atomically bound electron. 
Evaluating, we once again we find the 

77
00:05:22.437 --> 00:05:25.675
fine structure scale. 
And despite a res-mass energy of mc 

78
00:05:25.675 --> 00:05:32.434
squared of 500,000 electron volts. 
Alpha, 1 over 137 to the 4th power is 

79
00:05:32.434 --> 00:05:37.610
extremely small. 
And the net interaction of millielectron 

80
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.250
volts is far smaller than the gross 
electronic energy scale. 

81
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.380
Of electron volts or we can expect our 
exchange cost j to be. 

82
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.530
Even though the underlying mechanism 
relies more on spatial wave function 

83
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.810
symmetry we can capture the net effect of 
spin exchange with a [UNKNOWN]. 

84
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.126
Again, this is because flipping the 
relevant spin orientation of electrons 

85
00:06:00.126 --> 00:06:03.654
coupled electrostatically through their 
spacial charge distribution, changes the 

86
00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:08.270
spacial symmetry and induces enormous 
changes in energy due to exchange. 

87
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.202
This is the quantam mechanical version of 
dipole to dipole interaction, where we 

88
00:06:13.202 --> 00:06:19.418
have replaced the usual vector dipoles. 
With new ones having poly-matrix 

89
00:06:19.418 --> 00:06:23.080
coordinates. 
Clearly, from a classical viewpoint, if j 

90
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.698
is less than zero, this system favors 
ferromagnetism, since it's lowest energy 

91
00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:31.750
ground state occurs when the spins a line 
and the dot product is positive. 

92
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.673
Now how do we evaluate this Hamiltonian? 
There are spinup and spindown for each 

93
00:06:36.673 --> 00:06:39.610
electron. 
So we expect exactly 2 times 2, 4 

94
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.032
eigenstates. 
This means our finite-sized Hilbert space 

95
00:06:43.032 --> 00:06:47.640
much, must grow from the one-electron two 
by two Hamiltonian to a four by four 

96
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.790
Hamiltonian. 
We do this with a matrix direct product. 

97
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.868
Which is carried out simply by 
multiplying the elements of the first 

98
00:06:55.868 --> 00:07:00.560
matrix times the entire second matrix to 
form a block in the final result. 

99
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.493
The dot product between single particle 2 
by 2 spin operators then takes this form, 

100
00:07:04.493 --> 00:07:08.597
and upon substitution, we see the need to 
perform straightforward multiplication of 

101
00:07:08.597 --> 00:07:15.180
each term, then sum. 
This result is non-diagonal. 

102
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.390
But we know how to diagonalize it. 
This can even be done by hand. 

103
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:23.683
Here's the eigen values and associated 
igon vectors obtained by diagonalizing 

104
00:07:23.683 --> 00:07:28.167
the hamiltonion. 
One with eigen value minus 3 j. 

105
00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:32.340
And 3 degenerate vectors with eigen value 
plus j. 

106
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.450
What are these states? 
Let's remember the correspondance between 

107
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.315
our 2 component single particle spin 
vectors and spin up and spin down. 

108
00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:43.284
Assigning the first element to spin up 
and the lower element to spin down, we 

109
00:07:43.284 --> 00:07:47.442
can carry out the direct product and see 
that the components of a 4 element state 

110
00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:54.680
vector define a basis of up up. 
Up down, down up, and down down. 

111
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.772
Then it's clear to see that we have 
simply calculated the familiar singlet 

112
00:07:58.772 --> 00:08:02.770
and triplet spin wave functions all over 
again. 

113
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.560
Now we may ask, what's the net effect of 
exchange in a system with a large number 

114
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.780
spins, on a lattice. 
This may be a model for a crystalline 

115
00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.820
solid, for example. 
In general, our Hamiltonian sums over all 

116
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.060
possible spin, spin interactions. 
Which is incredibly difficult to solve. 

117
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.293
To simplify this task, let's consider 
only short range nearest neighbor 

118
00:08:27.293 --> 00:08:31.111
interactions. 
For a given spin at the i-th lattice 

119
00:08:31.111 --> 00:08:34.276
site. 
We're only going to include interaction 

120
00:08:34.276 --> 00:08:38.210
terms with the spins one lattice constant 
around the crystal axis. 

121
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.802
So the exchange integrals are all equal. 
For a square lattice in two dimensions 

122
00:08:43.802 --> 00:08:48.405
that's just four neighbors. 
And in three dimensions, it's six. 

123
00:08:48.405 --> 00:08:53.209
Now, even this is a hard problem. 
But the form of the Hamiltonian suggest 

124
00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:56.751
we make a further approximation. 
That all the nearest neighbors are 

125
00:08:56.751 --> 00:08:59.456
identical. 
Then this Hamiltonian has the same form 

126
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:05.400
as a magnetic moment interacting with a 
fictitious exchange meal field. 

127
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.520
This mean field is what orients a spins 
parallel in a ferromagnetic insulator 

128
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.304
when the thermal energy is low enough for 
the system To be below a phase 

129
00:09:11.304 --> 00:09:16.818
transition. 
But what about more common ferromagnets 

130
00:09:16.818 --> 00:09:19.580
like iron? 
A metal. 

131
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:24.002
There, the spins are not localized, but 
more like free electrons distributed in 

132
00:09:24.002 --> 00:09:29.544
space. 
Before describing ferromagnetic metals, 

133
00:09:29.544 --> 00:09:32.676
I'd like to review plain old metals This 
can be thought of as a gas of non 

134
00:09:32.676 --> 00:09:37.550
interacting electrons with plane wave, 
wave functions. 

135
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.490
The quantum numbers are just the wave 
vector components kx, ky, and kz. 

136
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.162
By applying energy minimization, we 
account for all electrons in the system 

137
00:09:45.162 --> 00:09:50.820
by filling the lowest energy state at the 
orgin of k space. 

138
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.628
And then remembering poly exclusion, fill 
in states ever farther isotropically 

139
00:09:54.628 --> 00:09:58.350
until every electron has filled the 
state. 

140
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.340
This creates a so called Fermi's sphere 
with the radius given by the Fermi wave 

141
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.178
number ksabeth/g. 
But this picture does not capture the two 

142
00:10:05.178 --> 00:10:11.080
fold spin degenerancy of every state with 
definite kx, ky and kz. 

143
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.135
A better picture, in this regard, is to 
plot states not in three-dimensional K 

144
00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:17.002
space, but simply as a function of 
energy, determined by the square of the 

145
00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:22.340
distance from the origin. 
Then, we can plot states up to the Fermi 

146
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.450
energy, which have the maximum Fermi wave 
vector. 

147
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.622
However, as we move farther away from the 
origin in K space, we construct a 

148
00:10:29.622 --> 00:10:32.846
spherical shell It gets bigger and 
bigger, and accounts for more electron 

149
00:10:32.846 --> 00:10:37.370
states. 
The density of states, then, at a given 

150
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.530
energy, is growing. 
Plotting the density of states as a 

151
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.730
function of energy reveals that for a 
parabolic dispersion relation that we 

152
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.130
have here for mass and particles, gives a 
square root of energy dependence, and it 

153
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:52.299
is of course the same for spin up and 
spin down. 

154
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.521
Now we can easily but only partially spin 
polarize this system by applying a 

155
00:10:58.521 --> 00:11:02.978
magnetic field. 
Zeeman splitting states spin up and down 

156
00:11:02.978 --> 00:11:08.900
moving while relaxation processes keep 
the fermi energy constant in equilibrium. 

157
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.540
But in a system with farromagnetic 
exchange. 

158
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.957
The mean field, which is far stronger 
than any terrestrial magnetic field, does 

159
00:11:14.957 --> 00:11:19.870
this for us even in the absence of a real 
external magnetic field. 

160
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.997
The density of states at the firmia 
energy is then asymmetric and a spin 

161
00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:26.300
polarization in an equilibrium is 
maintained. 

162
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.773
Now, we might ask how we can make full 
use of these spin polarize electrons in 

163
00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:35.132
ferro magnets. 
For example, can we transfer this spin 

164
00:11:35.132 --> 00:11:38.260
asymmetry to otherwise non magnetic 
systems? 

165
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.550
Either other metals or even 
semiconductors? 

166
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.550
And if we can, what are the processes 
that govern relaxation of that spin 

167
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:49.400
polarization back to equilibrium in the 
non magnetic material. 

168
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.374
If those time scales are long enough. 
Can we manipulate spin asymmetry before 

169
00:11:53.374 --> 00:11:58.828
equilibrium is obtained? 
All of these questions are relevant to 

170
00:11:58.828 --> 00:12:02.013
exploiting the spin degree of freedom in 
solid state devices, with the goal of 

171
00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:05.002
addressing unique applications not 
effectively dealt with by ordinary 

172
00:12:05.002 --> 00:12:09.970
electronics. 
This is the field of spin electronics. 

173
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.160
Which has impacted us all through the 
development and use of the giant 

174
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.955
magnetoresistance effect and hard drive 
read sensors, the discovery of which was 

175
00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:23.053
recognized in 2007 with the Nobel Prize. 
In the next lecture, I'll tell you a 

176
00:12:23.053 --> 00:12:26.061
little bit about spin polarized electron 
transport, especially the unique 

177
00:12:26.061 --> 00:12:29.950
difficulties of spin injection. 
And what you can learn once that 

178
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.530
challenge has been resolved.
