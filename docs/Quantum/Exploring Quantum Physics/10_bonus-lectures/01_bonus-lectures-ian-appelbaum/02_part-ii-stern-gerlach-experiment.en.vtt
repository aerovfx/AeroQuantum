Hello everybody, and welcome back to 
Exploring Quantum Physics. 

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.464
I'm guest lecturer Ian Appelbaum, and 
I'll be telling you about Stern-Gerlach 

3
00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:11.736
experiment. 
In the last lecture, we found that 

4
00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:15.026
incorporating the correct relativistic 
and variance into the quantum mechanical 

5
00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:18.183
wave equation. 
Constructing the Dirac equation, not the 

6
00:00:18.183 --> 00:00:21.207
Schrodinger equation, left us with the 
requirement that the electron wave 

7
00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:26.010
function has two components. 
Our hope is that understanding this 

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.960
degree of freedom will lead to an 
explanation of the anomalism effect, 

9
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.360
where gas discharge spectral lines are 
split into more than the three components 

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.012
of a Lorentz triplet. 
The Stern-Gerlach experiment, the subject 

11
00:00:37.012 --> 00:00:40.738
of today's lecture, was instrumental in 
revealing the underlying physics of this 

12
00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:44.883
so-called anomaly. 
The experimental geometry of the 

13
00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:50.130
Stern-Gerlach Experiment was something 
like this figure. 

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.150
Where silver was heated in a vacuum so 
that individual atoms with thermal energy 

15
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.930
kBT of several thousand kelvin were 
emitted from a furnace, and collimated 

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.972
through two sequential slits. 
This beam then passed through a region of 

17
00:01:02.972 --> 00:01:07.140
high magnetic field gradient 
perpendicular to its velocity. 

18
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.763
These were neutral atoms, so the magnetic 
field itself did not affect the 

19
00:01:09.763 --> 00:01:13.511
trajectory. 
However, for atoms carrying a magnetic 

20
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:17.216
moment, the gradient of the magnetic 
field will impart a force and deflect the 

21
00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:22.010
beam. 
We can predict the observed deflection by 

22
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.260
first calculating force. 
This is just the gradient of potential 

23
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.100
energy which we know from the dipole 
interaction energy. 

24
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.404
The displacement is given by the solution 
to the classical equation of motion for a 

25
00:01:32.404 --> 00:01:36.147
constant force. 
Using the time of flight, length over 

26
00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:39.202
thermal velocity, we then have a complete 
expression that we can use to obtain 

27
00:01:39.202 --> 00:01:44.510
quantitative values of deflection. 
For a gradient of about ten Tesla per 

28
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.291
centimeter over a distance of three 
centimeters. 

29
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:53.439
We predicted deflection of 100 microns 
for a moment of one Bohr magnetron 

30
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.404
oriented parallel to the gradient. 
If the moment is oriented anti parallel, 

31
00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:01.810
the deflection is in the opposite 
direction. 

32
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.158
Now if the magnetic moments of the 
neutral atoms are distributed randomly 

33
00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:08.344
upon emission from the furnace, as 
expected from a classical degree of 

34
00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.977
freedom. 
This deflection will vary continuously 

35
00:02:11.977 --> 00:02:15.260
and merely result in a broadened beam of 
width times D. 

36
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.150
So what happened? 
What did Stern and Gerlach actually see? 

37
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.165
Here's what Stern and Gerlach saw on the 
glass slide removed from the apparatus, 

38
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:28.090
after converting the nearly transparent 
deposited silver into black silver 

39
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.066
sulfide. 
On the left is the deposited pattern from 

40
00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:34.126
the silver beam without the perpendicular 
field gradient, and on the right is the 

41
00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:38.197
pattern with the field gradient. 
Overlaying the pole geometry used to 

42
00:02:38.197 --> 00:02:41.577
create the gradient shows that that 
horizontal deflection is greatest in the 

43
00:02:41.577 --> 00:02:45.540
middle, simply because the field gradient 
is higher there. 

44
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.754
The length scale shows that this 
deflection is in the order of our 

45
00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:52.594
calculated 100 microns. 
But the most remarkable thing about the 

46
00:02:52.594 --> 00:02:55.762
pattern with the magnetic gradient is 
that it is not simply smeared as expected 

47
00:02:55.762 --> 00:02:58.930
from randomly oriented magnetic moments, 
but that they're split into two well 

48
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.758
resolved beams. 
This postcard was sent to Bohr and it 

49
00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:05.600
says below something like, 
congratulations on confirmation of your 

50
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.452
atomic theory. 
Stern and Gerlach thought that they were 

51
00:03:09.452 --> 00:03:12.990
measuring the orbital magnetic moment 
predicted by Bohr's model. 

52
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.730
But this was 1922 before the Schrodinger 
equation, and the realization that the L 

53
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.820
equals zero S dates have zero angular 
momentum. 

54
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.670
It doesn't measure the orbital component, 
they were measuring the magnetic moment 

55
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.870
of the intrinsic angular momentum of the 
unpaired 5S electron. 

56
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.235
This is rather unfortunately called spin 
for historical reasons. 

57
00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:35.367
And the twofold splitting of the atomic 
beam is due to the two possible 

58
00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:39.490
Eigenvalues of the Z component, plus or 
minus h bar over two. 

59
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.462
It's then natural to identify an 
additional quantum number, the spin 

60
00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:46.402
magnetic quantum number M sub S, that 
takes the value of plus or minus one 

61
00:03:46.402 --> 00:03:50.564
half. 
A so-called g factor, nominally equal to 

62
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:53.981
two, due to a relativistic effect called 
Thomas procession from Lorentz boost, 

63
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:59.730
must be included in the conversion from 
angular momentum to magnetic moment. 

64
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.492
We therefore identify the two components 
of the electron part of the Dirac wave 

65
00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:07.280
function as the amplitudes of spin up and 
spin down. 

66
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.679
For those interested in the serendipity 
behind this experiment, and the 

67
00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.710
historical development of the correct 
interpretation. 

68
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.155
I rem, recommend this popular account by 
Friedrich and Herschbach in Physics 

69
00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:22.905
Today, very highly. 
Incidentally, long after this extremely 

70
00:04:22.905 --> 00:04:27.530
important experiment, Stern won the Nobel 
Prize during World War II. 

71
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.698
But Gerlach was snubbed, in part because 
he stayed in Germany to work on wartime 

72
00:04:30.698 --> 00:04:34.990
weapons development for the Nazis. 
I said it was unfortunate that the word 

73
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.878
we use for electronic intrinsic magnetic 
moment is spin. 

74
00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:42.358
And this is because, although it's 
natural to try to understand how an 

75
00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:46.498
individual particle can carry intrinsic 
angular momentum, there's no classical 

76
00:04:46.498 --> 00:04:50.354
analog to it. 
Still, one can find figures like this 

77
00:04:50.354 --> 00:04:55.720
propagating a false notion in text books. 
In fact, the idea of spin was at first 

78
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.048
ridiculed for the very reason that the 
geometrical interpretation leads to 

79
00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:03.210
nonsense such as this. 
If an electron is a spinning charged 

80
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.680
sphere, then what's the velocity at the 
electron surface? 

81
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.298
We can calculate the classical electron 
radius, by equating the electrostatic 

82
00:05:11.298 --> 00:05:14.430
potential energy needed to assemble 
charge E into the sphere with the 

83
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.598
electron rest mass. 
And then use it to determine the velocity 

84
00:05:19.598 --> 00:05:24.246
necessary to generate one Bohr magneton. 
The result is the speed of light divided 

85
00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:28.415
by the fine structure constant. 
A dimensionalist quantity equal to about 

86
00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:33.126
one over 137, far less than unity. 
The velocity then would have to be over 

87
00:05:33.126 --> 00:05:36.740
two orders of magnitude higher than the 
speed of light. 

88
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.532
Clearly nonsense. 
This issue played an important role in 

89
00:05:40.532 --> 00:05:43.488
history. 
Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck are credited with 

90
00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:47.392
the correct interpretation of the 
Stern-Gerlach experiment in 1925, as 

91
00:05:47.392 --> 00:05:51.960
being due to the intrinsic electron 
angular momentum. 

92
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.846
But perhaps only because they were lucky 
enough to have an open-minded advisor, 

93
00:05:55.846 --> 00:06:00.730
Ehrenfest, who said, well, that's a nice 
idea, though it may be wrong. 

94
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.480
But you don't yet have a reputation, so 
you have nothing to lose. 

95
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.817
Whereas the same idea had apparently been 
suggested several years before by Kronig, 

96
00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:10.919
who was thoroughly discouraged by his 
mentor Pauli, who said, it's indeed very 

97
00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.785
clever, but of course has nothing to do 
with reality. 

98
00:06:14.785 --> 00:06:19.075
Llewellyn Thomas, who introduced the 
Thomas G factor, wrote a humorous letter 

99
00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:24.080
to Goudsmith after his paper's 
publication saying the following. 

100
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.230
I think you and Uhlenbeck have been very 
lucky to get your spinning electron 

101
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.270
published and talked about before Pauli 
heard of it. 

102
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.260
It appears that more than a year ago 
Kronig, believed in the spinning electron 

103
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.866
and worked out something. 
The first person he showed it to was 

104
00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:41.023
Pauli. 
Pauli ridiculed the whole thing so much 

105
00:06:41.023 --> 00:06:44.677
that the first person became also the 
last, and no one else heard anything of 

106
00:06:44.677 --> 00:06:47.636
it. 
Which all goes to show that the 

107
00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:52.614
infallibility of the Deity does not 
extend to his self-styled vicar on Earth.
