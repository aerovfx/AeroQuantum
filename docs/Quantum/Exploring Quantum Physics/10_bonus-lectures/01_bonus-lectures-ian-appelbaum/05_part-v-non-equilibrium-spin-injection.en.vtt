00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.430
This is the last part of my Guest Lectures
on Electron Spin, in which I'll focus on

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.840
normally non-magnetic systems which are
pushed out of spin degenerate equilibrium

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.690
by spin injection from an external
thermomagnetic source.

4
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.680
I'm going to first tell you why we
want to study these systems, and

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.180
why this is such a hard problem, or

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.310
at least why the most straightforward
approach to solving it is bound to fail.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.510
Then I'll show you one particular
way that I have personally used

8
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.420
to obtain spin injection in silicon and
germanium semi-conductor devices.

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.580
And a little bit about what
can be learned as a result.

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.510
To motivate the kinds of information about
non-equilibrium spin transport we're

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.600
after, I want to appeal to the history
of non-equilibrium charge transport.

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.380
Namely, minority carriers and
semiconductors.

13
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.260
The seminal measurements
were done by Haynes and

14
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.448
Shockley in the mid 20th
century at Bell Labs.

15
00:00:50.448 --> 00:00:55.620
In these time-domain experiments,
a narrow pulse of minority electrons

16
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.240
were injected into p-type semiconductors
filled with equilibrium holes.

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.220
An electric field carried these
electrons to a charge detector,

18
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.610
where the pulse could be analyzed.

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.530
By measuring the time of flight they could
determine the minority carrier mobility or

20
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.950
the proportionality constant
between applied electric field and

21
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.030
electron velocity.

22
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.990
By measuring the spreading
of the pulse in time,

23
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.330
they determine the strength of random
thermal fluctuations from scattering,

24
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.930
the minority carrier
diffusion coefficient.

25
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.390
And by integrating over the pulse and

26
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.090
determining how many electron made it
without annihilating with a positively

27
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.160
charged hole, the minority carrier
lifetime could be determined.

28
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.480
Without these values, none of the solid
state devices be use today can be designed

29
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.660
and successfully made.

30
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.090
So, if we speculate any use for a spin
polarized electrons out of equilibrium

31
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.860
in semi-conductor devices, then we
at least need to be able to measure

32
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.650
the spin analogs of these parameters.

33
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.540
So, let's first look at why it's not so

34
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.190
easy to transfer
the substantial spin imbalance,

35
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.220
spin polarization from a feral magnet
into a non-magnetic electronic material.

36
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.230
Especially when using a semiconductor
in an effort to make, for example,

37
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.810
new kinds of spin transistors.

38
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.800
The most straightforward way one might
naively try is to make an ohmic or

39
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.310
linearly resistive contact between
the feral magnet and the semiconductor.

40
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.520
Let's see how this works for
plain old charge injection.

41
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.130
Ohm's law says that the charge current
density flowing is proportional to

42
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.450
the conductivity and driven by spacial
gradient of an electrochemical potential.

43
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.130
This combines the effects of electric
field gradient of electrostatic potential

44
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.330
with flow from high concentration
to low via random thermal

45
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.779
fluctuations comprising
the random walks of diffusion.

46
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.540
If we incorporate the device geometry,

47
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.636
we can use this expression to recover
the more familiar V=IR form of Ohm's Law.

48
00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:55.340
In metal-semiconductor ohmic contacts,
current is conserved

49
00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.090
across the interface but the conductivity
in metal is large so the potential energy

50
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.700
provided by voltage qV drops mostly across
the lower conductivity semiconductor.

51
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.940
Now, if you want spin injection to
accompany this charge injection

52
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.880
then the currents for spin up and
down must be different.

53
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.620
Since the connectivities for up and
down are the same in the semiconductor,

54
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.890
their respective electrochemical
gradients must be different.

55
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.730
This is what we need to happen
on the semiconductor side.

56
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.920
Spin up and down electrochemical
potentials have different gradients to

57
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.790
drive asymmetrical current densities
comprising of spin current.

58
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.530
The one avoidable consequence of this
asymmetry is electrochemical splitting at

59
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.780
the ohmic inter-phase.

60
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.870
Using Ohm's Law we can obtain a
relationship between current polarization

61
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.140
and this electrochemical
potential splitting.

62
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.750
The first term in parenthesis is due
to the average potential drop over

63
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.010
the transport length scale L.

64
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.310
Note that although J up and
J down are not equal,

65
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.100
their sum does equal the total
charge current as expected.

66
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.010
Now, we have to derive equivalent
expressions on the ferromagnetic

67
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.880
side where we will see the deleterious
effect of the splitting on spin inject.

68
00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:13.070
On the ferromagnetic side,
the electrochemical potential splitting

69
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.840
relaxes to zero in equilibrium due to
spin flips away from the interface.

70
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.110
The spin relaxation length scale is the
so-called spin diffusion length lambda.

71
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.160
By once again applying Ohm's Law we
get the following expressions for

72
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.980
the current densities of spin up and
down on the ferromagnetic side.

73
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.160
Note that there are two important
differences between these expressions for

74
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.950
the ferromagnet and the ones above
describing transport in a semiconductor.

75
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.900
First, the spin dependent connectivities
are not equal in the ferromagnet

76
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.210
due to their dependence on
the asymmetric carrier densities.

77
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.840
Second, and as a result the deviation of
the interface lecture chemical potential

78
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.750
from equilibrium are not symmetric.

79
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.630
In other words, C up is not
equal to C down in this figure.

80
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.930
However, because the ideal
interface preserve spin,

81
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.930
the electrochemical
potentials are continuous.

82
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.240
So, we do have the sum rule giving us
a total splitting, which we need to

83
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.460
determine the spin polarization flowing
across the interface in the semiconductor.

84
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.620
Using the definitions of both
the injected current polarization and

85
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.810
the bulk ferromagnetic polarization,
we can derive a simple expression for

86
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.300
the splitting on the ferromagnetic side.

87
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.140
In intimate omega contact, the
electrochemical potentials are continuous.

88
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.470
So this is the same as a splitting
on the semiconductor side.

89
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.940
We can therefore substitute it into
our previously derived expression

90
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.620
to obtain this result.

91
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.100
Note that this is very different
from our naive expectation,

92
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.020
since it depends strongly on the magnitude
of a dimensionalist parameter Epsilon,

93
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.050
the ratio of connectivities and
transport lengths across the interface.

94
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.350
If Epsilon is much less than 1 then
only when the bulk magnetic polarization

95
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.790
beta is approximately 1,
a half metallic ferromagnet,

96
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.300
do we recover the desired case where
the injected current polarization P

97
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.140
is approximately equal to the bulk
ferromagnetic polarization beta.

98
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.300
Unfortunately, the bulk polarization of
a typical ferromagnets is around 50%.

99
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.510
So as this plot shows,

100
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.270
I'll make an injection is doomed in
the last epsilon is at least .01.

101
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.890
However, the relevant materials properties
are not forgiving in this respect.

102
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.150
The ratio of conductivities between
a semi-conductor and a ferromagnetic

103
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.660
metal is significantly below unity,
even from highly dope semi-conductors and

104
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.670
how we disordered amorphous
ferromagnetic metals.

105
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.700
Like wise the ratio of
length scales is small

106
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.800
due to the fast spin relaxation
in the ferromagnetic

107
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.530
leading to the spin defusion length
lambda of approximately tem nanometers.

108
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.990
Where as in semiconductors with low
spin orbit interaction such as silicon.

109
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.710
Transport lengths can be ten microns or

110
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.290
longer, even at elevated
ambient temperatures.

111
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.450
Therefore, even in the best scenario,
epsilon is approximately 10

112
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.800
to the minus 4, leading to the negligible
polarization showing the figure.

113
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.580
Over the range of expected values for
epsilon, one needs bulk polarization of at

114
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.130
least 95% for injected polarization
of greater than 10% or so.

115
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.100
So elemental ferro magnets iron,
cobalt, and

116
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.260
nickel are useless for
spin injection in the Ohmic region.

117
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.240
In fact,
the problem is evident even graphically.

118
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.540
The splitting delta mu
which is necessary for

119
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.405
a non-zero injected current polarization
also tends to reverse the spin of

120
00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:43.230
electro-chemical potential gradient at
the interface on the ferromagnetic side.

121
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.550
Inhibiting injection,

122
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.580
the very spin species we want to
inject into the semiconductor.

123
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.140
Therefore in order to maintain the
constraint of current conservation across

124
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.290
the interface the study state
inter-facial splitting is small and

125
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.820
the injected current polarization,
P is negligible.

126
00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.705
Modern techniques to over come this
problem include quantum mechanical

127
00:08:02.705 --> 00:08:06.350
tunneling, and in my lab
ballistic hot electron injection,

128
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.643
which circumvents the issues relevant for
ohmic injections here.

129
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.960
I'm not going to describe
the details of spin injection and

130
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.150
detection, that's a whole other course.

131
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.240
In device physics and magnetism, but
rather what we can learn from measurements

132
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.820
of spin transport and
manipulation by any mean.

133
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.230
The key to extracting the most information
from these measurements is exploiting

134
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.155
a topic I mentioned several
seconds ago spin precession.

135
00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:34.228
Again this is the magnetic analog
of a spinning top or gyroscope,

136
00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:38.460
with off axis gravitational force,
causing a mechanical torque.

137
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.570
In spin transit devices,

138
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:45.210
we apply a magnetic field perpendicular
to the injected spin direction but

139
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:48.570
parallel to the transport direction and
caused by electric fields.

140
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.585
And the spin will precess, in a plane.

141
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.860
The final spin precession angle is
determined by the product of spin

142
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.110
procession frequency,
determined by magnetic field strength,

143
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.060
about 28 gigahertz per Tesla.

144
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.580
And a material with weak spin
orbit coupling like silicon, and

145
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.200
the transit time inversely proportional
to electric field strength.

146
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.100
If we apply a perpendicular magnetic
field with the appropriate strength,

147
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.940
then you can cause the spins to
precess an average of 180 degrees,

148
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.690
fully flipping with respect to
their ejected polarization.

149
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.240
Your experimental measurement of sigma,

150
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.340
the spin along the initialization
excess will then vary.

151
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.870
Doubling the magnetic field,
doubles the procession frequency and

152
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.790
therefore results in an average
procession angle of 360 degrees.

153
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:39.280
A coherent full rotation restoring
the expectation value of sigma Z,

154
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.120
as you can see from this
actual experimental data,

155
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.700
it doesn't matter whether the field
polarity is positive or negative.

156
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.900
In other words it doesn't matter
if the spin processes clockwise or

157
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.820
counterclockwise.

158
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:56.210
Now if all the electrons have a same
transit time injector to detector.

159
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.270
We would expect this cosine like
oscillation to continue indefinitely for

160
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.570
higher and higher orders of precession
rotations, but that's not what happens.

161
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.880
In reality,

162
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:11.710
not all electrons have the same transit
time due to random scattering processes.

163
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.400
Therefore an uncertainty in transit time

164
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.779
gives rise to an uncertainty
in precession of angle.

165
00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.810
When the procession frequency grows
in higher and higher magnetic field,

166
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.470
the effects of partial cancellation can
be seen and the oscillations diminish.

167
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.950
We can model this measurement
with a transport simulation,

168
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:34.310
summing up the cosine-like contributions
from electrons where the distribution of

169
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.930
arrival times in order to fit
the non-equilibrium spin mobility and

170
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.410
diffusion coefficient we're after.

171
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.020
However, there's a model independent
method with far greater utility.

172
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.760
The key is to recognize that
this integral summation

173
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.950
is really just a Fourier transform.

174
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.920
Therefore, the oscillations we measure
can be inverted to yield the empirical

175
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.199
transport distribution without
any model dependence whatsoever.

176
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.140
In this example we can see the effects
of increasing the electric field.

177
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:08.460
Oscillation period increases, and the
number of oscillations themselves grows.

178
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.210
But the transforms clearly show that this
is a result of smaller mean transit time

179
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.160
and standard deviation.

180
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.530
This method of obtaining time of
flight is called the Larmor clock.

181
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.370
We don't make an explicit
measurement of transit time.

182
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.640
We measure the angle of rotation
at a known angular velocity.

183
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.690
The same way we measure
time from an analog clock.

184
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.950
We know the rotation speed of the hand for
the clock, 360 degrees per hour for

185
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:37.130
the minute hand, and infer time
from the instantaneous orientation.

186
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.930
We're likewise measuring
the spin orientation and

187
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.220
determining how long it processed
in a known magnetic field.

188
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:48.490
For measurements of spin transport,
we can correlate the transit time

189
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.620
with final spin polarization and
extract the spin lifetime.

190
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:57.280
In silicon, we can see that although the
non-equilibrium lifetimes of hundreds of

191
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.270
nanoseconds are fairly long In comparison
to the momentum relaxation time of

192
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:05.940
pico seconds or
less is strongly dependent on temperature,

193
00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.020
increasing dramatically
as the sample is cooled.

194
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.152
This demonstrates the importance
of relaxation via a nominally

195
00:12:12.152 --> 00:12:16.575
spin-independent process, electron
scattering off of thermal phonons,

196
00:12:16.575 --> 00:12:18.285
distortions in the crystal lattice.

197
00:12:19.735 --> 00:12:23.805
This electron phonons spin relaxation
process results from the fact that,

198
00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:26.685
do to the weak but
non zero spin orbit coupling,

199
00:12:26.685 --> 00:12:31.070
the electron wave functions are not
pure spin eigenstates up and down.

200
00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.940
Rather spin up has a small amount
of spin down and vice versa, but

201
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.200
remain fully orthogonal.

202
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.700
We can calculate the transition rate
between these states constituting a spin

203
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.850
flip due to momentum scattering of
these free electrons from wave vector

204
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.229
k to k prime by using using the so
called Fermi golden rule.

205
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:52.680
This first order expression is
proportional to the square of the matrix

206
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.710
element of the scattering potential,
coupling the two initial and

207
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.410
final states, and
the density of final states row.

208
00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.630
Now, even if the scattering potential only
couples states of different momentacae

209
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.070
due to the spin order mixing
of the wave function,

210
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.890
we see that there's
a non-zero matrix element.

211
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.730
And this is exactly equal to
the quantity determining the spin

212
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.560
preserving momentum relaxation rate.

213
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.320
The spin-relaxation is therefore
proportional to the momentum relaxation

214
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.480
and also proportional to the square but
typically small spin mixing amplitude.

215
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.160
This being the end of my contribution to
this course I'm obliged to acknowledge

216
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.710
support, not only for my experimental
research on spin transport, but

217
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.980
also support for scientific
outreach efforts to students and

218
00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.500
the public outside my institution,
the University of Maryland.

219
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.170
In particular,

220
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.510
the National Science Foundation Career
Award has made this work possible.

221
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.580
It's been my great pleasure to share this
quick story of electron spin with you.

222
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.330
And I invite you to learn about more
about Spin through your own study and

223
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.230
perhaps even original research in physics
and engineering labs around the world.
