00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,270
Hello everybody,
my name is Ian Applebaum and

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,920
I'm an associate professor of physics
at the University of Maryland.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,520
Today I'll be giving a guest lecture in
this exciting online course exploring

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,060
quantum physics.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,840
I'm thrilled to be delivering this topic,

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,680
in part because my own research
deals with experimental aspects

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,520
of spin polarized electron transport
in semiconductor materials.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,230
And I feel strongly that understanding
the historical background

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,710
I'm going to tell you
about today is absolutely

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,540
essential in making future
progress in this modern field.

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,320
I want to start our discussion of the
discovery of electrons spin, by reminding

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,650
you of what was known around the turn of
the 19th century about atomic spectra.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,330
High voltage across a discharge tube
filled with low pressure hydrogen

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,060
causes the emission of
electromagnetic radiation.

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,610
Optical photons and

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,520
a spectrometer can be used to disperse the
different wavelengths across a detector.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,040
The discrete wavelength seen were
known long before quantum theory

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,430
to satisfy Rydberg's formula which
told us that the photon energy Is

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,680
proportional to the difference between the
reciprocals of two squares of integers.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,670
Bohr's theory which included quantization
of angular momentum in classical electron

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,880
orbits captured this famous result but
it was wrong for many reasons we now know

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,360
such as failure to predict the ground
state absence of angular momentum and

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,430
importantly the degeneracy of
each principal electronic level.

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,880
From the solution of Shrodinger's equation
in spherical metrical potentials, we know

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,220
not only that has the ground stayed zero
angular momentum but also that the excited

26
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,790
levels were the principal quantum levels
not one, we're actually degenerate.

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,588
Meaning that several states
have same iogin energy g.

28
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:47,695
This follows from the multiple
spherical harmonics,

29
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:53,148
labeled by the polar quantum number l,
and as quantum number m.

30
00:01:53,148 --> 00:01:57,670
A spectroscopic notation is
to label l equals zero as s,

31
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,576
l equals one, p, l equals two,
d, and so forth each level of

32
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:07,677
principle quantum number n has
a maximum l equal to n minus 1 and

33
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:12,968
states with a given value for l,
have values of m given by minus l,

34
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:18,880
minus l plus 1, in integer steps through
zero and up to l minus one and l.

35
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,990
This gives a total
degeneracy of 2l plus one.

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,100
Therefore each set labeled by a given

37
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,680
principle quantum number n
has degeneracy of n squared.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,360
A natural question to ask then is how can
we observe this degeneracy experimentally?

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,970
We need to break the degeneracy,
split the levels and

40
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,620
alter the photon emission spectrum.

41
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,110
We can do this with a magnetic field.

42
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,610
Here's how.

43
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,130
Let's imagine that we have a classical
electron orbit with total angular momentum

44
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,100
given by this expression.

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,110
Now, this circulating charge
particle comprises a current,

46
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,249
and so, the orbit has,
necessarily, a magnetic moment.

47
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,100
Classically we know that
the magnetic moment that

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,500
absolute value of that magnetic
moment is given by just the current

49
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,230
times the area that it circulates around.

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,800
Now the current in this
case is one electron

51
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,320
circulating around in a given period.

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,850
So this is the charge of the electron
minus e times the frequency of it's orbit.

53
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,330
And the area off course for circular orbit
is just PI times the radius squared.

54
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,210
Now the frequency of the orbit is
just given by the velocity divided by

55
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:43,180
the circumference two PI R.

56
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,860
And that gives rise to a simple
expression for the magnetic moment.

57
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,730
But here, we're going to play a little
bit of a trick and multiply and

58
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,850
divide by the electron mass,
and also Planck's constant.

59
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,618
And the reason why we do this
Is that we can see m, v, r.

60
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:08,825
[NOISE] here, is the absolute value

61
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:13,678
of the total angular momentum.

62
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:18,650
Which has the same units
as the action h bar.

63
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,700
That means that

64
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,170
this fraction of out front carries all
of the units of the magnetic moment.

65
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,510
In fact, it has a special name.

66
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,158
It's called the Bohr magneton.

67
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,639
So with this magnetic moment we
know that in a magnetic field,

68
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,010
each state is going to acquire
an energy due to the interaction.

69
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,640
Now if the magnetic field
is along the z axis,

70
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,490
then we can simply write this
interaction energy as minus the z

71
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,350
component of the magnetic moment
times the magnetic field along z.

72
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,780
So, if different states with the same
principle quantum number n have different

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,320
values for the z component of the magnetic
moment, their energy eigenvalues

74
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,930
will shift differently in a magnetic
field, and the degeneracy will be broken.

75
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,800
So we need to calculate the magnetic
moment associated with each orbital.

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
From the preceding discussion, we know the
relationship between angular momentum and

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,530
magnetic moment.

78
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,990
And if the field is aligned to the z-axis,

79
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,080
we only need to calculate
the vector component along z.

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,400
But this means we need to know
the angular momentum vector along z.

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,660
So we need to calculate is
expectation value, and for

82
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,720
that we need an operator representation.

83
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,740
We know that the linear momentum
operators are h bar over i,

84
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,580
times the derivative with respect to
the conjugate real space variable.

85
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,690
So it's easy to see, that the angular
momentum along z takes this form.

86
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,750
Because phi, the azimuthal angle,
is its conjugate variable.

87
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,420
The expectation value then
is this matrix element,

88
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,670
the operator sandwiched by the state.

89
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,080
The only part of the way
function that matters here

90
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,880
is the phi dependents which we
know from the spherical harmonics.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,190
The derivative brings down
a factor if i x m and

92
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,140
what's left is the original
normalized state.

93
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,250
We see then that our answer
is integer units of h bar

94
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,170
determined by the azimuthal
quantum number m.

95
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,630
This is why m is commonly called
the magnetic quantum number.

96
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,270
Now we can complete our calculation.

97
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,310
The energy added due to the interaction of
the orbit's magnetic moment with magnetic

98
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,240
field along z is simply the Bohr magneton
times the magnetic field strength times

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,570
the magnetic quantum number.

100
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,140
This result is pleasing enough but

101
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,140
some understanding of the scale
of the effect is helpful.

102
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,640
The Bohr magneton is small,
about 60 micro electron volts per Tesla.

103
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,960
And a Tesla is a huge magnetic field,

104
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,340
about 20,000 times the strength
of the Earth's geomagnetic field.

105
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,650
The largest fields in the lab,

106
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,350
created with superconducting coils,
are several tens of Tesla.

107
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:09,110
The energies are then small in comparison
to the electronic transitions.

108
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,510
So any observed shifts
of the spectral lines,

109
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,850
are going to be proportionately small.

110
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,160
So here's what happens.

111
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,190
A non zero magnetic field induces
a splitting between degenerate states,

112
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,630
adding energy to states with
positive magnetic quantum number m,

113
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,020
and subtracting from
states with negative m.

114
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,130
All states with m equal zero
Including this all ground state

115
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,960
level are unaffected.

116
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,760
The splitting energy is
name after Pieter Zeeman

117
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,140
who want to now bill price in 1902 for
observing this Petron line splitting when

118
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,730
gas discharge tubes were
placing in the negative field.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,900
Now we have to remember that this
energy spectrum we calculate

120
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,200
is not the same as the optical
spectrum of emitted photons,

121
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,480
which are only due to
transitions between the levels.

122
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,950
And not all transitions are allowed.

123
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,600
The expressions which determine
when the transitions are allowed

124
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,850
are known as selection rules.

125
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,470
We're going to calculate them next.

126
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,300
During an electronic transition electron
wave function forms a super position

127
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,090
of the initial state and
the final state with lower energy.

128
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,750
Each component evolves
differently in time so

129
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,560
the electron probability distribution
center of mass can move.

130
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,140
This oscillating dipole is what
radiates electromagnetic energy.

131
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,490
A simple calculation of the expectation
value of position yields this expression.

132
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,420
Where we can see the first two direct
terms from the inner product of the wave

133
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:42,810
function are symmetric, whereas r,
the radial variable, is antisymmetric.

134
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:45,310
So integration over them vanishes.

135
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,430
The cross terms, which oscillate at
the frequency determined by the energy

136
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,430
difference of initial and
final states, may survive.

137
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,300
Now, those away functions have previously
been writing in spherical coordinates.

138
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,900
We want to convert interval into
cartesian coordinates so we can see

139
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,550
along which axis we might get a charge
oscillation and electromagnetic radiation.

140
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,770
Here's the transformation we
need in terms of the polar and

141
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,580
azimuthal angles veta and phi.

142
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:17,087
It allows us to split the vector integral
from the previous slide into individual

143
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:20,430
cartesian components.

144
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:25,830
First, let's consider the x and
y components of the integral over angle.

145
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,160
We'll have to evaluate
something like this,

146
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,320
two complex exponents containing phi and
sin of cosine over phi.

147
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,980
Using the Euler formulas,
we see that this will involve integrals

148
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,408
over integer periods of
the oscillating complex exponential.

149
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:47,620
Which is identically equal to 0
except when the exponent is 0.

150
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,020
Since the z component
does not depend on phi,

151
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,100
it's even easier to see that in this
case the integral will be equal to 0.

152
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,070
Only if the magnetic quantum numbers for
initial and final states are the same.

153
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,690
Taking together, we see that there is no
dipole transition and no corresponding

154
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,680
emission of photons unless the change
in magnetic quantum number is plus or

155
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,110
minus one or zero.

156
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,269
This is our selection rule.

157
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,510
By considering these
kinds of arguments about

158
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,220
periodic symmetry of the integrand and
the integral over the polar angle theta,

159
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,650
we can likewise derive another
selection rule for transitions,

160
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,932
such that the change in orbital
quantum number must be + or -1.

161
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:33,540
So which transitions are allowed?

162
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,040
l must change by 1 and
m can change at most by 1.

163
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,340
The 2 piece stage can decay to the 1s
ground stage and in a magnetic field all 3

164
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:49,070
of these transitions from m equals 1 zero
minus 1 have different energies giving

165
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,170
different emitted photon wave lengths that
we can analyze with the spectrometer.

166
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,250
The 3s state.

167
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,758
Decays only to the three 2p states.

168
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:04,000
And 3p decays to 2s, also with
three distinct transition energies.

169
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,410
For higher values of principle quantum
number n, we can have transitions from

170
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,210
the l = 2 d states with
a broken degeneracy of 5,

171
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,090
which can transitions
to the lower p states.

172
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,810
This involves many possible transitions
that satisfy the selection rules.

173
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:29,790
However, there are always only three
different transition energies,

174
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,780
delta m equals minus one,
zero and plus one.

175
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,490
So each spectral line splits into
a triplet in a magnetic field.

176
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,000
Now I want to point out
something extremely important in

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,080
atomic spectroscopy.

178
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,040
Recall the energy time
uncertainty principle.

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,530
It says that there's a reciprocal
relationship between the lifetime of

180
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,890
a state and
the resulting spectral line width,

181
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:57,890
which limits resolution of
high precision measurements.

182
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,850
If a transition is forbidden by selection
rules, other processes maybe allowed, but

183
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,240
typically far less efficient and
result in exceptionally long life times.

184
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,940
Here, we see that the transition to
the bound state from the 2s state,

185
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,210
is forbidden by the selection rule.

186
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:18,650
And other processes yield a lifetime
of over a hundred milliseconds in

187
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:24,110
comparison to the nearly equal transition
from 2p to 1s in about one nano second.

188
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,548
The line went through this transition,
is therefore extremely narrow.

189
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:32,560
Allowing very high-precision measurements
of exquisite quantum effects such as

190
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,950
the Lamb shift.

191
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,730
Due to small corrections of energy levels
from quantum electrodynamical effects

192
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,490
of the electron interacting with short
lived excitations in the vacuum.

193
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,800
In addition to the selection rules, we
can use the different forms of the dipole

194
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,850
vector components to explain another
feature of zamon splits electrical lines.

195
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,180
They're optical polarization and
directional dependants.

196
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,690
For instance, we know that the transition
corresponding to delta m equal to 0,

197
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,470
no change in the magnetic quantum number

198
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,730
during the transition is caused by
a dipole along the magnetic field axis, z.

199
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,750
However, we also know from classical
electrodynamics that an oscillating dipole

200
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,760
does not radiate along its axis.

201
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,500
Therefore, this spectral line is absent
when observed along this orientation.

202
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,020
The other two are present, and
due to dipoles oscillating 90 degrees out

203
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,610
of phase along x and y, yielding right and
left handed circularly polarized light.

204
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,520
If we observe from a direction
perpendicular to the magnetic field

205
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,940
access, then the delta m equal to zero
line in the middle can be seen and

206
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,000
has a linear polarization along c.

207
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,300
The other two are polarized
perpendicular to the field axis.

208
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,590
Because they are again due to dipole x and
y.

209
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,740
Hendrik Lorentz win the Nobel Prize
in 1902 along with [INAUDIBLE].

210
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,660
For explaining this
polarization dependence.

211
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,410
He used only classical physics,
a theory which we now know is wrong.

212
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,440
Despite this perceived success
in explaining the Zeeman effect,

213
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,270
a serious problem remained.

214
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:15,510
Some spectral lines split into
triplets as predicted but

215
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:20,680
others split into multiplets of four,
six, etc.

216
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,710
Here's a few examples.

217
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,940
Now, we haven't made a silly mistake,
we just need to re-examine

218
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,318
the ingredients of our theory,
namely the equation.

219
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:38,489
Converting the classical kinetic
energy into an operator is correct in

220
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:43,423
the absolutely non-relativistic case as
we've done here with the construction of

221
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:48,218
the Schroedinger equation, but we're
clearly leaving out an essential piece of

222
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:52,338
physics by not even using
a relativistically invariant expression.

223
00:14:52,338 --> 00:14:55,316
Now, can we fix the problem
by starting from scratch,

224
00:14:55,316 --> 00:14:59,657
constructing a wave equation by starting
with the relativistic expression for

225
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:01,680
kinetic energy that's given here?

226
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,540
That's what we're going to
see in the next slides.

227
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,660
By the way, those of you who haven't seen
this expression before might want to see

228
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,690
that It's asymptotically equivalent
to the classical expression,

229
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,870
in the limit that the momentum p is small.

230
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,250
Then we can expand the square root and
it's Taylor series, and

231
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,990
see that the dominant terms are the
familiar mc2, rest-mass energy, and

232
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,949
the classical kinetic energy.

233
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,290
Everything else is small,
all though not negligible, as we will see.

234
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,500
If we take a relativistic expression and
try to use it as

235
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,700
an operator on a wave function,
we immediately encounter a problem.

236
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,980
Our momentum operators
are within the square root.

237
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,989
And it's not clear at all whether
this makes any mathematical sense.

238
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,900
The problem disappears if
the expression inside the square root

239
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,500
is itself a perfect square.

240
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,020
If we write the rest mass energy and
kinetic energy components in x, y, and

241
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,950
z here, 1, 2, and
3 with arbitrary coefficients,

242
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,860
then we can make this a perfect square if
these coefficients satisfy what appears,

243
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,039
at first, to be an unusual constraint.

244
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,380
It give unity when squared, but
they anti commute with each other.

245
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,830
These coefficients clearly
are not scaler values.

246
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,680
However, this fact didn't
frighten Paul Dirac

247
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,320
from writing down this relativistically
invariant equation in 1928.

248
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,600
The alpha coefficients
are clearly not scaler values.

249
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,150
But matrices, which satisfy the anti
commutation relations, and form a so

250
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,290
called Clifford algebra.

251
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,360
Now we can write down many matrices which
satisfy the algebra, but it makes sense to

252
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,240
first look at the simplest case,
with the smallest dimension matrices.

253
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,300
It turns out, this can be done with
matrices as small as four by four.

254
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,280
Here's one choice of basis.

255
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:58,010
I two is the two by two identity and
o two is a two by two matrix of all zeros.

256
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,560
The two by two poly matrices,
the sigmas form the off diagonal

257
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,480
blocks of the alpha one two and
three four by four matrices.

258
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,795
Now importantly, this converts
the wave equation into a four-by-four

259
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:17,750
matrix equation and the wave function
into a four-component vector.

260
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,850
Two of these correspond to arrest
mass energy of mc squared,

261
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:29,500
when the momentum p is equal to zero,
as we expect for an electron.

262
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,550
But a natural question to
ask is why two values?

263
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,540
Degeneracies like this are a signature
of symmetry, but which one?

264
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,690
Which degree of freedom do
these two values correspond to?

265
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,060
We're going to look at an experiment for
a clue.
