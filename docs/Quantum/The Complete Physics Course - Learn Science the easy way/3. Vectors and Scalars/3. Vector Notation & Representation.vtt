00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.940
So let's talk about vector notation vectors are represented by arrows, the longer the arrow, the greater

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.660
the magnitude.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.580
So once again, let me ask you this.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.950
What what does magnitude mean?

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.660
Well, it's just referring to the value, the size of it.

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:23.130
So if we actually do have ourselves a short arrow like this in comparison to a long arrow like this,

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.880
well, this is going to be referring to a small magnitude versus this one, which is going to be a large

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.410
magnitude.

9
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.610
And that's then.
