00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.550
So what are Vector's and Scalars?

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.120
Well, Vector's and Scalars actually were referred to quantities that have to deal with magnitude and

3
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.600
direction.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.500
Well, actually Vector's have to do with magnitude and direction, whereas scalars just has to do with

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.230
magnitude.

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.770
By magnitude I mean the value.

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
So I know that this is very vague, but hopefully after an example are to actually be able to explain

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.930
this a little bit better to you.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.920
So let's get into that.

10
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.620
So for example, a block has moved a distance of five meters.

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.160
That's that's the only information that we're being given here, is the magnitude magnitude is the idea

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.210
that the block is being moved a distance of five meters, which is a scalar value.

13
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.890
So if we were to say that the block has been displaced five meters to the right, well, that's a magnitude.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.090
And the direction which is indicating to us that where do you want the vector?

15
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.610
So Provectus and Scalars that we do have Decter quantities and scale or quantities, once again, vectors

16
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.980
are having to deal with a magnitude and a direction where scalars only have a magnitude of value.

17
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.560
So like in the previous example where we were saying that we were displacing a box five meters to the

18
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.700
right, the displacement has a both a magnitude and a direction, whereas for the scale or quantity,

19
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.330
for the distance, we can actually say that we were able to move the box a distance of five meters nurser.

20
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.330
There's no direction there.

21
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.800
So these are all of our vector quantities and our scale or quantities.

22
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.120
If we're to actually be referring to velocity, I would have to say that we're moving at a rate or a

23
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
velocity of five meters per second in a given direction.

24
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.980
Now, that could that direction could be north, south, east, west, up, down, left, right.

25
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.770
It could be at a 45 degree angle.

26
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.880
We have to specify the direction.

27
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.290
Otherwise we could actually just be referring to the speed.

28
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.600
So you might be looking at these terms over here and you might have an idea that velocity and speed

29
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.590
relate to each other.

30
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.530
Speed, on the other hand, just actually has to do with the magnitude and not direction.

31
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.890
So five meters per second, that's a speed.

32
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.960
And a lot of times through physics classes as including this one, we might be actually just interchangeably

33
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.120
using the terms, velocity and speed.

34
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:27.700
But really technically just know the idea that velocities a vector and speed is a scalar and we should

35
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.080
really be saying in which direction it's going.

36
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.150
If we're referring to velocity and not having to specify that if we're dealing with a speed acceleration,

37
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.180
we could say that objects moving at two meters per second squared and that's an acceleration to the

38
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.830
right left, whatever the situation is, forces, I could apply a five new inforce onto an object to

39
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.590
the right and increase and decrease in temperature.

40
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.010
I want to actually decrease the temperature in my room right now.

41
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.060
Time.

42
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.540
Now what?

43
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.250
Is there any direction and time?

44
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.810
I'm reading my clock right now and it's 4:00 p.m. Is there any direction there?

45
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.590
Now, what about volume?

46
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.630
I have a 20 millilitre bottle on my desk right now.

47
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.230
Is there any direction in there?

48
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.010
No, that wouldn't make sense.

49
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.390
What about temperature?

50
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.520
Hey, currently in my room right now it's 74 degrees.

51
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.050
Is there any direction in that?

52
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.960
Now, what about mass?

53
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.880
Five kilogram block?

54
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.190
Well, there's no direction it wouldn't make sense that there would be direction there.

55
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.850
What about density in chemistry?

56
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.390
You actually deal with density a lot, but the density of an object, not how dense is it?

57
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.980
Well, that has nothing to do with direction.

58
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.380
Same thing with the energy.

59
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.660
If I looked up an object, maybe actually will remember this from seventh grader eighth grade science.

60
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.460
If I left it with an object, I'm giving it a certain amount of potential energy.

61
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.370
The object just has energy, it doesn't have energy in any sort of specific direction, it just has

62
00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.550
it.
