00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.570
So let's get into adding vectors now, what I like to do when I'm adding vectors is I'm actually going

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.550
to be thinking this as a displacement.

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.990
So let's actually take this object here and displace a certain amount.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.510
So vector one, let's call this a vector.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.160
And and that's the notation that we're going to be using to identify these factors.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.240
And so, once again, remember that a vector has both a magnitude and a direction.

7
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:36.660
So the direction is going to be to the north of this magnitude and vector to let's call it E, I'm sorry,

8
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.580
vector E for E, and it's going to once again also have a magnitude of this amount and in the direction

9
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.330
to the east.

10
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.630
OK, so these are two vectors and what we're going to do here is perform a vector addition.

11
00:00:50.970 --> 00:01:02.070
So let's take Vector and and add that to Vector E and the result here will be our resultant vector,

12
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.010
what's called the R-1.

13
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.900
So this is our resultant vector.

14
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.660
So I just want to cover a little terminology right now.

15
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.160
Let's look at these two.

16
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.160
So these two vectors are what's referred to as component vectors, and this is our resultant vector.

17
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.630
So if I actually open up my wallet and I'm looking at all all the contents in my wallet, I have some

18
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.210
credit cards, a very little amount of cash in there.

19
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.450
I have my IDs and those are the components of my wallet.

20
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.560
So when I'm when I'm looking at these Spectre's over here, these are the two component factors.

21
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.370
And we'll see that actually the result is a result factor.

22
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.810
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to take so the first instruction once again, I'm going to

23
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.700
be displacing this object.

24
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.250
And the first instruction that's being given is to go to the doctor and.

25
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.850
So let's do that, let's actually have our over here and the very first instruction is to go Vector

26
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.690
and I, my vector end right here.

27
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.420
And the way that I like to think about this is I'm just going to take this object and let's say it's

28
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.000
starting over here and then instruction tells us to move it vector.

29
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.670
And so now it's over here.

30
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.790
OK, so now what's next?

31
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.210
Oh, it says, hey, the next instruction is to go vector E.

32
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.380
So now the dot is over here and let's go vector E.

33
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.990
So if we're displacing our gut, what do we do?

34
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.150
Well, bring it from here to over here.

35
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.370
I like to look at look at this as if they're instructions.

36
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.200
OK, so.

37
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.620
Well, what's the result?

38
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.060
Hey, don't want the dot went from here to here to over here.

39
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.320
And that's the end.

40
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.690
Right.

41
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.310
Well, the result is it went from here and it ended up over here.

42
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.410
This is our result.

43
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.750
This is our result vector.

44
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.450
OK, so let's do another problem, let's do another example.

45
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.980
All right, so let's change this up a little bit.

46
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.270
It's not that much of a change, but never lost.

47
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:40.630
So we're just going to say vector E plus vector NT is equal to resultant vector number two.

48
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.820
OK, so, Wolf, once again, if we're going to be looking at these like are instructions, let's move

49
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.720
our dot around.

50
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:55.590
So the very first instruction tells us, let's move our vector, let's move our object e vector E.

51
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.030
So we're just going to be moving it that much over there and that's vector E.

52
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.570
So we're basically saying that we're going to be moving our dot from here to here.

53
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.800
OK, and then what's our next instruction?

54
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.050
Well, our the very next thing that we do is move it.

55
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.860
And so Vector NT is just going up like this.

56
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.570
So we're just gonna be taking our dot and moving up vector and so it started.

57
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.900
Down here in the ended up over here.

58
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.890
So our dad traveled from here to here and then here to here, and the result, what you could say is

59
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.090
that went from here all the way to over here.

60
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.150
And this is our result in factor number two.

61
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.350
And what we should be basically seeing here is maybe I didn't do this perfectly, but the idea is,

62
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.100
hey, you want.

63
00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:03.280
Isn't moving this north and then is this pretty much going to be resulting in the same thing as east,

64
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.970
then north?

65
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.000
Yeah, ignore it pretty much.

66
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.760
So what we should be able to see here is if I said move this over here like this, we should see that

67
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.950
the answers are pretty much the same, which if I drew this out perfectly, it would be.

68
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.520
But I think that you just have to accept the idea that I didn't draw this out perfectly and that's just

69
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:24.360
kind of the way it is.

70
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.670
So that's simply adding Vector's.
