1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,550
All right, so now we're ready to actually do some unit conversions here, so the very first Palm says,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,970
to convert the following eight feet to a number of meters.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,530
OK, so the very first thing that we do to start these problems is just to rewrite the eight feet.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,060
Now, OK, let's think about this here.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,450
If I'm to take this eight feet and multiply this by one when I change the value of this at all.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,060
Now, in one times, anything is equal to itself.

7
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,090
So this is also equal to eight feet.

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,940
OK, well, let's take this a step further than what if I was to multiply eight times five divided by

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,590
five?

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,050
Well, five divided by five is essentially one, right.

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,710
So this is still eight times one, which is still equal to eight feet.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
Nothing actually changed here.

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,180
The value didn't change itself.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,490
Right.

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, OK, so what if we already do 20 divided by 20 and what our needs are need to be insulting our

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,950
intelligence over here?

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,260
You could see, Celsi, that that's essentially one times a feat, giving us eight feet.

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,720
Right.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,290
So what if we were to do this when I'm actually just going to do is let's take a little side sidestep

20
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:19,760
right now.

21
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,720
We have and meters over here.

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:27,510
What am I to do is actually look over at our nice little fun facts over here, our unit conversions,

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,980
and basically look for, hey, which one of these attacks has to do with feet?

24
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,850
What we have here, we have over here, here, here.

25
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,090
Well, nothing in here.

26
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,450
Right?

27
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,910
And no feet in there.

28
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,750
No feet in here, no feet in here, so on and so forth.

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,340
None of this actually has to do with feet.

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,720
Right.

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,000
But these first four actually did.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,330
Right.

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,830
So what it makes sense for us to actually look at the first fact, which actually has to do with feet

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,000
and inches or feet and yards, feet and miles.

35
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,290
One's going to miss miles or feet and meters.

36
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,230
Well, we want to convert from feet to meters.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,430
So this fact over here actually does make sense that we'd be interested in it.

38
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,270
So we have three point two.

39
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,700
Eight feet is equal to one meter.

40
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,170
See, if I take eight feet and multiply this by three point twenty eight feet.

41
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:28,290
Divided by three point twenty eight feet, hey, that's essentially one, right, giving us once again

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,820
our feet, the value of the eight feet has not changed.

43
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,420
Right.

44
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:43,260
Well, I was actually just briefly look at this over here, so I'm just going to erase everything over

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,980
here and we have this three point twenty eight feet instead of writing three three point twenty eight

46
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,450
feet.

47
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,230
Could I just write one meter here?

48
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:01,180
Yeah, because we know that three point twenty eight feet is equal to one meter, so instead of writing

49
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:09,910
three point twenty eight feet, I'm just going to write one meter so I just can do this right here.

50
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,330
He raised this in itself around three point twenty eight feet.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm just going to write one meter because we know that three point twenty eight feet is equal to one

52
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,170
meter.

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,870
I just did a simple substitution here.

54
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,390
So we have one meter, which is equal to three point twenty eight feet.

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,690
Once again, this essentially is equal to one.

56
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,070
This over here is essentially equal to one not changing the value of eight feet, but what happens here,

57
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,560
this is eight feet.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,080
We could actually just put a division of one over here.

59
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,590
The feet will cancel each other out and leaving us with meters.

60
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,460
And we're trying to that's exactly what we're trying to do.

61
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,180
We're just trying to convert this into meters.

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,160
So if I put this in the calculator, the way that you would actually go about doing this is once again,

63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,630
you're going to be multiplying the numerators, divide that by multiplying by the denominators.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:14,510
So we have eight times one divide that by open princi one times three point twenty eight.

65
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:20,700
And when you plug this in the calculator, what you get is two point four four.

66
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:24,680
And the units that we have here are our meters.

67
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,870
So what we're doing here is we're converting the units were not changing the value.

68
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,310
We are just simply convert the units.

69
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:42,090
So what this basically is telling us is that eight fee is equal to two point four four meters.

70
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,350
And that's simply what we're trying to get across right now.

71
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,400
It's this is a unit conversion, not changing the value.

72
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,130
OK, so for the next one, let's set it up the same way, so the very first thing that we're going to

73
00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:01,890
be writing out is our three meters, once again, keeping in mind that our meters abbreviation is just

74
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:08,070
a little letter lowercase m and we have hey, and we're just going to be using the same fun fact over

75
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,560
here, this fourth one, because that has to do with feet and meters, basically saying that three point

76
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,700
twenty eight feet is equal to one meter.

77
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:24,400
Now, when I'm just going to do is once again right in our three point twenty eight feet over here.

78
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,420
Divide that by three point twenty eight feet.

79
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:37,830
And hey, once again, what we do is we substitute our one meter because three point twenty eight feet

80
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,370
equal is equal to one meter.

81
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,730
And what do we do here?

82
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:41,750
Oh, wait a minute.

83
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,180
It looks like that we messed up somewhere because the whole entire point of actually doing these types

84
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,850
of problems is idea that our units will cancel out if we have meters on top over here and we have feet

85
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,900
on the bottom over here.

86
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,550
Those don't actually cancel out.

87
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,190
They they simply that's not the way it works.

88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,900
We need to have meters on top and meters on bottom.

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:08,090
So what we did here is we substituted the top there, our numerator for one meter when it was the three

90
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:14,570
point twenty eight feet, what we should have done was actually rewritten our three point twenty eight

91
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,690
feet to one meter in the denominator.

92
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,990
Look at that.

93
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,660
OK, so once again, the whole point of this is to actually see that our units can't slot.

94
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,010
We have meters on top over here cancelling out with meter meters on the bottom over here, leaving us

95
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,760
just simply with our feet in the numerator.

96
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,080
So when we type this in the calculator, the way that you want to write this out is having your open

97
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,750
parentheses, multiply the numerators together, divide that by multiply, multiply by the denominators

98
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,160
together.

99
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,530
So we have three times three point twenty eight.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,580
Divide that by one times one.

101
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,680
And I'm sure a lot of you write right now, just now, hey, you want the division of one times.

102
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,230
One is just unnecessary to do in your calculator.

103
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:06,240
But when we do this, what we get here is an answer of nine point eight four and the units here are

104
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,890
fit.

105
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,320
Don't answer these problems without actually including your units.

106
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,470
The entire point of doing this is for the unit conversions include your units in the answer.

107
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:24,480
And once again, this is essentially saying here is that three meters is equal to nine point eight four

108
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,430
feet.

109
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,220
That's what we're saying when we're doing this unit conversions.

110
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:31,860
Once again, we did not change the value of the three meters.

111
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,960
We simply converted the units.
