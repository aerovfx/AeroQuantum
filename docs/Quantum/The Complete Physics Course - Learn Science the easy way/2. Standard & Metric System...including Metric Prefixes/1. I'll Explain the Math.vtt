At the beginning of each unit, I'll be covering the math skills that are necessary to do these physics

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.520
problems, it'll be very unfortunate to understand all the physics behind it.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.050
And when it comes time to solve the problem, you get it incorrect because of a simple mathematics understanding.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.460
So let's get started.
