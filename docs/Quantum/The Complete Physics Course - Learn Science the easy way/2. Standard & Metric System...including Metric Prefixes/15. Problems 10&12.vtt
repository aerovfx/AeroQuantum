00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.610
OK, so hopefully you try these problems on your own, and once again, I can't stress enough the idea

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.900
that if you're not practicing these problems, you're not going to get better at them.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.440
So if you haven't done so, pause this video and try these problems.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.880
But without further delay, we're just going to step into it and get to it.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.690
So we have twenty one point five feet per one second.

6
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.570
And ah, the idea here is we're going to go from feet to meters and then from second to ours.

7
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.900
OK, so from FITA meters, we're looking at our facts over here.

8
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.760
I'm just a recess that's a little bit in my way.

9
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870
So we're going from feet to meters.

10
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.530
Hopefully you're saying the idea that you're going to be using this fact over here and we have we're

11
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.100
going to be canceling on our feet right now.

12
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.930
So how many feet is it?

13
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.200
Oh, it's three point twenty eight feet is equal to what is equal to one meter.

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.920
Our units do cancel out, leaving us with meters.

15
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.760
Look at that.

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.600
We actually have our goal of getting 10 meters and we already have our meters.

17
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.600
The only thing is, though, is that we have meters per second and we want meters per hour.

18
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.910
So now we're going to be converting from seconds to hours.

19
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.310
We have seconds on the bottom, sorry, right off the bat.

20
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.060
We already know that.

21
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.260
We want seconds on the top.

22
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.950
Looking at this over here, hopefully we're saying we want to go from seconds to minutes.

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.740
So we have 60 seconds is equal to what?

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.940
It's equal to one minute and our Irey jumped ahead and cancel out my units.

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.530
Not a good practice, but either way, that's fine.

26
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.770
I saw that.

27
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.720
That's why we're on down.

28
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.880
And so now we to go from four minutes to hours.

29
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.610
Hopefully you're saying to yourself, we know that 60 Minutes is equal to one hour and I know I'm going

30
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.010
through this a little bit faster now, but ideally by now, you should actually be getting the feel

31
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.370
for this.

32
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.290
So we're done with this problem once again.

33
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.330
We actually do have our our on over here.

34
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.860
Our goal was ours.

35
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.270
So we're done with this one.

36
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.160
And when you play this in the calculator, hopefully you do get the answer of twenty three thousand

37
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.560
five hundred ninety meters per hour.

38
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.390
OK, so moving on to the next one, still farther away from earth, travel slower at speeds, blah,

39
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.620
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and we are simply converting objects, orbit orbiting at this altitude

40
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.710
travel at seven thousand seven hundred seventy seven point eight meters per second.

41
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.920
And let's convert this to miles per hour.

42
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.890
Once again, we're going to be converting this two miles per hour.

43
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:57.140
OK, so we do have our seven thousand seven hundred seventy seven point eight meters and we're going

44
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.100
to be converting this sorry.

45
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.740
And on the bottom, we actually do have our second.

46
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.690
So it's meters per second.

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.500
Those are units.

48
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.670
Once again, we're going to be converting from miles, I'm sorry, from meters to miles and then seconds

49
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.360
to hours.

50
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.060
So I'm just going to fly through this one right now.

51
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.740
We're going to be looking at this one to actually get from our meters to feet because our goal is to

52
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.280
actually get to our seconds.

53
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.720
And so we have meters, meters on the bottom.

54
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.380
Over here.

55
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.520
One meter is equal to three point twenty eight feet.

56
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.160
Unit cancellation.

57
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.420
And now we have our feet, hopefully, we're saying by now we have our feet and miles, that would make

58
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.960
sense.

59
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:51.170
So we have five thousand two hundred eighty feet is equal to one mile to our unique cancellation.

60
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.660
And we're left with miles on the top, which is great considering that's our goal.

61
00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.200
Now, we just won't convert our seconds to ours.

62
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.760
Hopefully we're saved by now.

63
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.540
We have 60 seconds is equal to one minute, you know, cancellation

64
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.540
and coming over here and saying that 60 Minutes is equal to one hour.

65
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.390
Cancel these out our goals hours.

66
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.660
We have hours in the bottom over here indicating to us that we're done with this problem and we should

67
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.170
put this into our calculator and get our final answer of seventeen thousand three hundred ninety four

68
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.950
miles per hour.
