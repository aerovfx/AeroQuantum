1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.740
So the two systems of measurement that we're going to be working with here, the U.S. and the metric

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.460
system, the quantities that works are going to be working as the length of mass and time.

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.980
So in the United States here, what is the smallest unit of length that you actually are used to working

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.340
with?

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.870
You might be seeing yourself.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:27.130
Inches or the inch and the abbreviation four inches is I and what's what's a bigger than an inch?

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.850
I'll give you what's 12 times bigger than an inch.

8
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.580
Maybe you're actually saying to yourself, A at the foot or feet, let's use the plural here, saying

9
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.000
that it's feet and the abbreviation feet is what maybe you're saying to yourself, F.T..

10
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.600
And what's bigger than a foot?

11
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.130
I'm going to give you a little clue here.

12
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.360
It's three times bigger than foot.

13
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.500
It's what players use on the football field.

14
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.500
Maybe you're saying to yourself, it's the yard.

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.280
And a lot of my students, they would actually say maybe the abbreviation for yard is widebody or something

16
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.660
like that.

17
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.590
But I believe it's actually just wide and I don't think that's actually very commonly used.

18
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.560
So I wouldn't worry about that one too much.

19
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.470
And what's a lot bigger than a foot in a yard.

20
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.650
So by a lot bigger I mean a significantly a lot bigger.

21
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.430
Like, how would you go about measuring the distance from, let's say, California to Florida?

22
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.850
Oh, OK.

23
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.520
Well, maybe you're saying to yourself it's Miles.

24
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.710
And what's the abbreviation for Miles.

25
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.270
Am I?

26
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:37.010
All right, so now what about over in Europe or so or actually really for the for the most part throughout

27
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.190
the rest of the world?

28
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.060
What are the units of measurement that they use for length?

29
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:50.190
Maybe you're saying to yourself, they use meters and the abbreviation there is AM, so the one thing

30
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.050
that I really do want to point out in that I really want you to actually focus on is the idea that looking

31
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.860
at the abbreviations here, which will be using a lot and I miss Miles and am is meters, do not get

32
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.830
these two confused.

33
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.860
I see this actually happen a lot.

34
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.450
And just keep that in mind that Miles, as am I and Meters is Šamaš.

35
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.960
OK, well, let's think about this year.

36
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.630
How many inches are there in a foot?

37
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.620
You might be saying to yourself that 12 inches is equal to one foot.

38
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:22.390
All right.

39
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.480
And how many feet are there in a yard?

40
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.950
Well, they are three feet in one yard.

41
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.730
Oh, what about this?

42
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.120
How many are there in a mile?

43
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.760
Let me just tell you this.

44
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:45.370
I bet you 99 percent of adults don't even know this as it's really not used in everyday kind of situation.

45
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.070
So it's very acceptable.

46
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.740
I get it.

47
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.940
But there are five thousand two hundred eighty feet in one mile.

48
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.580
How many feet are there in a meter?

49
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.150
Well, there are three point twenty eight feet in one meter when I'm actually just doing right now by

50
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.570
writing these equations out, is we're going to be using these to convert units.

51
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.610
These are going to be used for unit conversions.

52
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.470
All right.

53
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.220
And let's move down to the quantity of mass.

54
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.100
So we're working with mass.

55
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.120
This is going to be a little bit confusing in the United States.

56
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.870
Let's essentially say that the mass that we're going to be using for now, we're going to correct this

57
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.970
and yeah, we're going to correct this later on.

58
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.700
But for now, let's just say that the mass units are measured in pounds.

59
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.020
I know that this is actually a weight which is different than mass, but for for this unit conversions

60
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.190
and everything, I think it's acceptable to actually just say that as of right now, we're going to

61
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.020
be using pounds.

62
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.030
And what's the abbreviation for pounds?

63
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:09.340
I'll be yes, you might actually also see it written as L, b p s, and that's Latin for Labra Pontoise.

64
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.050
So that's that's where that actually comes from.

65
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.250
And now what about the mass four in the entire rest of the world that uses the metric system?

66
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.050
Well, the metric system actually uses what's called the gram.

67
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.070
And if you're thinking to yourself, hey, maybe you thought, oh, kg.

68
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.400
Well, the kilogram actually is just a further description of what the Gramma's it's just a prefix that

69
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.040
you're adding on there.

70
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.570
So the main route where there is actually the gram and the abbreviation for Gram is just a lowercase

71
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.910
G.

72
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.160
We can actually just go back into kilograms and saying that, hey, not just the fact that we're going

73
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:56.710
to be saying here is that one kilogram is equal to two point two pounds.

74
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.440
OK, so this is going to be the fact that we're going to be using in physics being that we're going

75
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.610
to be dealing with physical objects, I feel like that's going to be a lot simpler for us to actually

76
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.460
be measuring things in kilograms, rather, in grams.

77
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.670
OK, so next up, what is the smallest unit of time that you can actually think of?

78
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:24.670
Maybe you're saying to yourself the second or seconds and the abbreviation for this is either S or S

79
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:31.210
e c for the most part in this course, when I'm actually going to do is just use C, C, because it's

80
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.980
just explicitly defines that a lot clearer, a lot better.

81
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.490
What's the next bigger thing than the second.

82
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.510
We'll have our minutes, and that's my end.

83
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.570
And what's bigger than a minute?

84
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:55.510
Hopefully you're saying to yourself, to our which is just each are and what's bigger than our maybe

85
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.870
you're saying to yourself the day, which I believe that our vision for day is just simply day.

86
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.450
I don't think that there is actually abbreviation for that.

87
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.700
And then maybe you're saying to yourself, A, what's bigger than a day is a week and then you actually

88
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.390
have a month.

89
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.680
I'm not going to include those for the units that we're going to be dealing with right now, mainly

90
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.450
because, hey, how many days are there?

91
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.990
A month.

92
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.910
You'll have 28 days in a month.

93
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.380
You have thirty days in a month.

94
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.000
You have 31 days in the month.

95
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.970
So I'm not actually just going to use that.

96
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.110
Let's actually just go up from there.

97
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.760
And we actually have the year abbreviation for years.

98
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.120
Just why are OK, so this is going to be fun and simple for us right now.

99
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.330
How many seconds are there?

100
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.090
In a minute.

101
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.640
We have 60 seconds is equal to one minute and then we have how many minutes are there in an hour.

102
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.900
We have 60 Minutes is equal to one hour.

103
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.060
And how many hours are there in a day and how many days are there in a year?

104
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.430
Who you know this one.

105
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:07.240
All right, so there's three hundred sixty five point two five days in one year.

106
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.230
And you know what?

107
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.990
So there's a lot of my students are like, oh, that sounds made up on owners and why there's three

108
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.170
hundred sixty five point two five days in one year.

109
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.820
And that's actually a very specific and very accurate measurement right there.

110
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.910
And once again, you might be setting this up.

111
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.100
OK, so what does that mean?

112
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.680
And once this is just nestl additional fun fact over here.

113
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:37.250
But keep in mind, hey, if we do have our son over here and we have our planets actually orbit around

114
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.200
the sun, keeping in mind what you have, the planet Earth over here, it takes one year to actually

115
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.370
orbit around and get back to where the original position was.

116
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.110
And that's the definition of a year.
