People have been measuring things for thousands of years, and Egyptians used to use their fingers,

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.800
hands and arms to measure distances because there was no measuring tools like laws back then.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.630
So what's the problem with the system?

4
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.600
Well, there's no standard because everybody says was different, it was up to the Tharaud, the ruler

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.900
of ancient Egypt, to set the standards length's.

6
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.550
After many years, people create in many ways to measure things.

7
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
But scientists had problems replicating experiments because there was not an agreed upon standard of

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.670
measurement.

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.040
Today, the world uses two systems of measurement.
