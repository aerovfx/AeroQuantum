1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,270
So the first three problems over here.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,310
These really don't have anything to do with the physics that we're going to be doing a little while,

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,460
but you should actually just know how to do these proms anyway.

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:17,340
But these other two proms right here, they did what they were going to be using the skill, the mathematical

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,630
skill sets for those two proms to be able to sort out for the physics problems and a little bit.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,360
So the instruction over here says solve for X, so we have 12 is equal to three times X.

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:32,880
Keep in mind that there's a multiplication of three right there.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,880
So it's three multiplied by X.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,950
So how do we get rid of a multiplication of three?

10
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,950
Hopefully you're saying to yourself, well, we have to divide by three.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,730
So if we divide by three on the right hand side the equation, we also have to divide by three on the

12
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,720
left hand side the equation.

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,580
And the reason why we did that was because the two threes over here will cancel out, leaving us with

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,080
X on the right hand side of the equation.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,820
So we have to divide by three.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,040
Four is equal to X..

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,950
We could check to see that this is true simply by looking at the original problem and just substituting

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,970
our four in for our X, and we see that three times four is equal to twelve.

19
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,350
That's a true statement right there.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,080
So we know that we actually did the problem.

21
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,700
Correct.

22
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,270
Next problem over here we have five is equal to divide by three.

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,040
Well, it's a division of three.

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,370
Right.

25
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,320
So what's the opposite of divided by three?

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,020
Well, we have to multiply the branch of the equation by three.

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,580
You know, we multiply the right into the equation by three.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,310
We also have to multiply the left hand side of the equation by three as well.

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,600
These two threes once game was canceled.

30
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,920
That's the entire reason why we did the multiplication of three in the first place and we're just left

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,650
with fifteen is equal to X.

32
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,800
Once again, you can look at the original from over here and realize that if we do substitution of 15

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,810
and for the X right there on the right hand side, we have 15 divide by three, which is equal to five.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,240
The right hand side and left hand side are equal to each other.

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,060
That's the definition of an equation in the first place.

36
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,580
So that should make sense.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,250
All right.

38
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:01,200
So for the next one over here, maybe you haven't really seen this exponent over here.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,440
That's what the two is above the X, so we have X squared, plus three is equal to nineteen.

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:13,530
One thing actually really like to do is just tell my students that hey, was over here on the left hand

41
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,190
side of the equation.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,160
What we have here is what's called terms.

43
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,870
We have two terms here.

44
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:25,800
You're essentially just having to once again isolate the X, so you have X squared over here plus three.

45
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,750
How do we get rid of this plus three over here this second term?

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,890
So to actually get rid of that, what we have to do is subtract three on the left hand side the equation

47
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,140
then that we subtract it, three on the left hand side.

48
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,270
The question, what do we have to do on the right hand side?

49
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,190
Well, once again, we have to subtract the three.

50
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,450
And the whole reason behind this is actually do this cancellation.

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:49,320
So we are left with X squared is equal to 19.

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,240
Minus three is equal to 16.

53
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,680
All right.

54
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,080
Well, we don't care what X squared is equal to.

55
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,640
I want to know X is equal to.

56
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,050
So what's the opposite of square number?

57
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,740
Maybe you're saying to yourself that we have to take our square root.

58
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,300
So being that we took the square root of the left hand side equation, we also have to take the square

59
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,710
root of the right hand side of the equation.

60
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,040
And so we're left with X is equal to, well, what's the square root of sixteen, what two numbers that

61
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,590
are the same as each other multiply together to get you a 16.

62
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,080
Maybe you're saying to yourself that the answer is four, which is correct.

63
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:30,460
But it's not only positive four, it's also negative four, because we know that positive four times

64
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:37,240
positive four is equal to a positive sixteen and a negative four times negative four is also equal to

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,370
a positive sixteen, keeping in mind the idea that a negative times, a negative will give you a positive

66
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:42,850
answer.

67
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,530
All right.

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,720
So hopefully those are those are clear to you.

69
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm not really fully concerned if this over here, the positive plus minus is unclear at this stage.

70
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,460
It's something that you should review and you should actually know at some point, but maybe it's not

71
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,310
as relevant to you right now at this time in this course.

72
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,110
All right.

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,020
So for these next few problems over here, there's two different ways that we can actually simplify

74
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,990
these, I guess, expressions right now.

75
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,020
So we have three times four divide by two.

76
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,150
The one way that we can actually do the simplification is a reduction so we can actually reduce this

77
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,270
fraction over here knowing that four to five by two is equal to two.

78
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,460
So we have three times two is equal to six.

79
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:27,070
Another way that we can actually look at this, though, is looking at three as if as if it's three

80
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,930
divided by one that doesn't change the value of it just makes it into a fraction form, just like the

81
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,220
four to by two is.

82
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:40,600
So another way that we could actually simplify this is we can multiply the two numerators together and

83
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,990
multiply the denominators together and then we do the division from there.

84
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:52,690
So what that looks like is this we'll just have the three times four divided by one times two and that

85
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,880
gives us three times four is equal to twelve, one times to equal the two and twelve divided by two

86
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,720
is equal to six.

87
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,410
Notice here that we have the same answer, just a different method.

88
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,190
So just go and get to this next problem over here.

89
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,190
We have to divide by one which is equal to two words, gumboot reducing the fractions.

90
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,920
And we have four divide by two to see what a two and four divide by four, which is equal to one.

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,670
So two times two is four times one is equal to four.

92
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,430
And the other way that we could go back to you.

93
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,320
And this is multiplying our numerators together.

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,320
And the denominator is and just doing that method two times fours equals eight times four is equal to

95
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:29,770
thirty.

96
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:38,440
To divide that by one times two is two times four is E and 32 divided by is equal to four.

97
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,270
Once again, noticing that we actually get the same answer over here.

98
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,330
So this method over here of multiplying fractions together, that's what we're going to be using in

99
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:46,960
our lesson.
