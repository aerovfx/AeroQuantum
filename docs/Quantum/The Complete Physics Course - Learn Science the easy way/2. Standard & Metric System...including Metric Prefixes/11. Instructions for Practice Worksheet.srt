00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,300
Attached to this video, there is a document and that document is basically just this worksheet over

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,950
here, I cannot stress enough that the person who will practice these problems and actually do these

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,230
problems as opposed to just watching the video, that person will actually see it a lot more than if

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,640
you're just watching these videos.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,270
So I highly encourage you to actually just practice these.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,340
And kind of if you're not able to do this on your own, that's OK.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,040
As a matter of fact, these first four you might be able to do on your own.

8
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,540
But then once you actually scroll down a little bit more, we actually do have these more complex problems,

9
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,490
these multisite problems over here.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,630
And then it comes down and we actually get into a lot more complex problems.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,470
So these first four problems you might be able to do on your own.

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,380
If not, that's OK.

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,090
We're actually just going to go through these.

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,430
But once again, I highly suggest that you download this document, print it out and try it with me,

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:56,810
OK?

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,230
And I will give you time to try out some of these problems on your own.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,350
So don't worry about that.

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,120
I fully consider the idea that you need to practice this on your own, so I will give you enough practice

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:06,870
to do that.
