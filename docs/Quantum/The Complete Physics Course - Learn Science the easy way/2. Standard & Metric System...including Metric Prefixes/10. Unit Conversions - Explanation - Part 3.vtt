00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.710
OK, so we're going to still be converting our units over here, but notice that we're actually not

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.230
going to be converting to the standard system for the first problem over here.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.680
We have three point six, eight kg, and we're going to be converting that to just number of grams.

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.630
So it's going to come from the kilo to the number of grams.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.870
So kilograms.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.720
This is the metric system and same thing with grams.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.560
This is just metric system right here.

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.980
So we're not even getting into the standard system or the U.S. system at all whatsoever.

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.100
So once again, we're actually just going to be looking at our conversion units over here on the right

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130
hand side and we actually see that.

11
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.090
And once again, all of these actually have to do with a length or distance displacement.

12
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.140
We do see that this factor over here does actually have KG.

13
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.660
And then we're looking at these over here.

14
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.560
These are actually having to do with prefixes.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.930
You actually see that we have meters and kilometers, centimeters and meters, millimeters and meters.

16
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.120
And these over here, we actually have to do with time.

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060
So that's not actually going to be right.

18
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.770
Interested in that one either.

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.150
But like I actually said before, and the introduction is that instead of actually just looking at this

20
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.580
as a thousand meters and is equal to one kilometer, we can actually just say, hey, you know what,

21
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:23.660
a thousand grams is equal to one kilogram, just like a thousand milligrams is equal to one gram.

22
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.250
So these prefixes apply to whether it be in meters, grams or liters, wherever the case is.

23
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.340
So for this problem over here, once again, I'm actually just going to do by starting this off is just

24
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.280
writing our three point six, eight kilograms.

25
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.490
Multiply that by our unit conversion fracture faction to about this by one.

26
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.470
We have our kilograms now.

27
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.380
OK, so the two facts over here that we're going to be looking at are, is this one over here being

28
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.690
that has to do with kilograms as well as this one over here, and it has to do with kilograms as well.

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.720
So do we go from kilograms to pounds or from kilograms to grams?

30
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.270
OK, so it makes a lot more sense that we actually do use this one over here and not this one.

31
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.690
So once again, will we actually want to do is make sure that we're going to be canceling our units

32
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.250
so we have kilograms on the top over here and we want kilograms on the bottom over here.

33
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.430
How many kilograms is it?

34
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.750
Oh, it's just one kilogram easy.

35
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.060
Gold is equal to what?

36
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.520
It's equal to a thousand grams.

37
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.080
Once again, our units can.

38
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.760
We went from kilograms over here to number of grams.

39
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.140
That's what we're our end goal is.

40
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.460
And we do have grams up here.

41
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.830
So that's a good indicator that we're done with this problem.

42
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.360
All we have to do is put in the calculator and we are done so in the calculator.

43
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.680
Just write it in like this three point sixty eight times are 1000.

44
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.760
Divide this by one times one or you just plug it in just like as it is and we'll get our answer.

45
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.970
So we have three thousand six hundred eighty grams.

46
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.290
And once again, what this really is saying is that three point sixty eight kilograms is equal to three

47
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.520
thousand six hundred eighty.

48
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.450
Grams, so once again, this over here, we're going from centimeters to number meters, centimeters

49
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.780
is the metric system and meters is also the metric system.

50
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.600
So once again, we're actually not going to be converting into the standard system at all whatsoever.

51
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.550
OK, so let's just start this off.

52
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.120
So we have 563 centimeters.

53
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.660
And I know what I heard now that we're going to be doing cancellation over here, so we want Sandomierz

54
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.010
on bomb, all we have to do is just come over here.

55
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.210
These are all the ones who actually have to do with Submenus.

56
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.210
I see right up here.

57
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.440
We have centimetres over there.

58
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.710
So we have centimeters and meters.

59
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.190
Once again, we're going from centimeters to meters.

60
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.510
So it does make a lot of sense that we're actually going to be using the stack over here.

61
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.060
Notice that none of these other facts actually has to do with centimeters.

62
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.250
So how many centimeters is it?

63
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.290
It's 100 centimeters is equal to, what, one meter?

64
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.620
Once again, our units will cancel out.

65
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.860
We have centimeters on top, centimeters on time.

66
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.590
They can slow and we're going from centimeters to meters on the top.

67
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.910
Over here, we have meters.

68
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.780
So that's a good indicator to us that we're done with this problem over here.

69
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.550
And when we tosteson clear, what does that do?

70
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:25.090
563 times one divided by one times a hundred, and this is equal to five point six three meters, once

71
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:33.040
again, just telling us that 563 centimeters is equal to five point six three meters.
