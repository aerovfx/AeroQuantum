1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,280
OK, so now we're ready for these multistep problems once again, I'm actually going give you the opportunity

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,660
to do these problems on your own.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:11,520
But for right now, ideally, you're actually going to be writing these notes with me and we're just

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,030
going to be doing them together.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,290
So once again, these do we actually get a little bit more complex?

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:22,740
But hopefully they won't be complicated because I'm going to be explaining them to you as efficiently

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,450
and as clearly as possible.

8
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,240
So let's get to the first one.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,290
And I think that the first one over here is actually probably like the nicest being that we are going

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,340
from days to minutes.

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,970
And these are like units that you're probably comfortable with.

12
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,950
OK, so let's get into this.

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,250
So we have three days and once again, we're going to convert converting our units.

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,150
So we already know that, hey, what we are going to be canceling our units.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,480
So we have days on the top and we have days on the bottom over here.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,670
And so we're just going to be even though these problems are multistep, we're just going to be using

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,360
the same exact principles as we were using before.

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,030
So let's keep in mind that we're going from days to minutes.

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,560
Let's look at these over here.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,430
Obviously, we don't want to use any of these because these are dealing with length and not time.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,180
And down here, we actually do have our units of that deal with time.

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,440
So I'm actually just noticing right now I'm missing the idea that there are three hundred sixty five

23
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,930
point two five days.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,420
Is equal to one year, I'm sorry about that, but either way, though, we do see that we have days

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,670
over here and we have days over here.

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,170
So which one of these actually does it make more sense to go to, considering the idea that we're going

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,350
from days to minutes?

28
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:45,000
Does it make sense for us to go from these two years or does it make sense for us to go from days to

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,630
hours?

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,810
And let's think about this.

31
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,570
So obviously this if we go to hours, we're getting smaller and closer to minutes rather than years,

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,390
which is actually getting bigger and farther away from Mezze.

33
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:05,850
So let's just, I guess, trust me on this and we're going get closer to our minutes by going to hours.

34
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,090
So how many days is it?

35
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,330
Oh, it's just the one day and I know I have plural all over here, but whatever that doesn't really

36
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,160
matter is equal to what.

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,870
Oh, that's equal to 24.

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,460
Oh.

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,050
Yes.

40
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:29,690
24 hours, OK, so once again, our units do cancel out, so our days will cancel out, leaving us with

41
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,420
hours, but we don't want ours, we want minutes.

42
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,640
So this is where the multistep actually comes in.

43
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:40,700
What we're going to do here is actually multiply this by another conversion unit so we have ours and

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,900
we won't get to minutes.

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,200
So which one of these actually does have to do with both hours and minutes or election gets closer to

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,790
minutes?

47
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,380
So we have here oh, we have ours right here and we have ours right here.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,120
So these two both have to do with ours.

49
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:58,430
But we are used this one over here.

50
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,750
And it wouldn't really make sense for us to actually use that again, because we would go from hours

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,470
to days.

52
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,950
That really doesn't make much sense.

53
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,320
So we do have hours and minutes over here and our goal is to actually get to a number of minutes.

54
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,980
So it does make sense that we that we would use up once again.

55
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,890
We do want our units to cancel out.

56
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,910
So we have ours up here on the top and our numerator.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,480
So therefore we want ours in the bottom, in our denominator for them to be able to cancel out.

58
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,430
So how many hours is it?

59
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,160
Oh, it's one hour is equal to what?

60
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,590
It's equal to 60 Minutes.

61
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,770
OK, so our hours cancel out, leaving us with minutes, oh, wait a minute, look at this.

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,210
We want minutes over here and we have minutes over here.

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,320
That's once again our indicator to us, the idea that we're actually dealing with this problem.

64
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,580
So we plug this into the calculator and we get our answer.

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,620
So we just multiply our numerators once again.

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,340
That would actually just be our three times 24 times 60.

67
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,470
Those are all the numerators.

68
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,480
Divide that by all of our denominators, which is one times, one times at one.

69
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,390
And once we play this in the calculator, we'll get the answer of four thousand three hundred twenty

70
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:16,920
and the units that we have.

71
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,660
Is minutes.

72
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,550
OK, so just basically saying that three days is equal to four thousand three hundred twenty minutes,

73
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,590
and that's the way that we do that problem.

74
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,940
OK, so let's go on to the next one.

75
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:34,690
You know what?

76
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,970
Let's go into problem number.

77
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,110
Seven.

78
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,240
So we have ten point five miles.

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,820
To number of kilometres or kilometers, however, you can't pronounce it, so we have ten point five

80
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,160
miles.

81
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,650
Once again, Miles is just am I and not am.

82
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,630
So we're not going to be confusing em with my.

83
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,720
All right, so we have our miles on the top, so therefore right off the bat we are in now because we're

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,850
doing the calculation now, we want miles in the bottom.

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,590
And where do we actually have our miles?

86
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,540
Oh, once again, we actually do have it over here.

87
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,240
And that's the only spot where we actually do have our miles.

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,650
So it's one mile is equal to 4000, 280 feet.

89
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,590
And we're basically being out there.

90
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,460
That's the only one that has to do with Miles, where we're we're stuck with actually using this fact

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:33,930
over here.

92
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,050
So that's what we're going to use.

93
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,220
Once again, our units you can't cancel out and we're left with feet.

94
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,430
The only thing is, though, is that we don't want that.

95
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,050
We want our kilometres.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,170
So we're going to have to do another conversion factor and for the time, draw our fashion line.

97
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,610
We're going to have our feet down here.

98
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,910
And what makes the most sense now?

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,480
So we have feet over here.

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,230
We have feet.

101
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,710
We have the this one doesn't make sense the speed that we just use that one.

102
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,450
So we could cross that one out already.

103
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,010
And we have feet over here.

104
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,870
Those are the only ones that have to do with feet.

105
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,590
Let's keep in mind once again, we want to get to kilometres.

106
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:15,850
Does it make sense that for us to go from feet to inches, feet to yards or feet to meters, once again,

107
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,130
we want to get to Kyllo meters?

108
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,500
So hopefully you're saying to yourself, well, maybe it makes sense for us to go from feet two meters

109
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,130
and use this one over here, and that's what we'll do.

110
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,040
So we have how many feet?

111
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,530
Oh, it's three point twenty eight feet is equal to, what, one meter?

112
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,010
Once again, our feet will cancel out.

113
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,610
OK, let's once again our feet will cancel out, leaving us with meters.

114
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,770
The only thing is though is that we don't want meters.

115
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,730
We won't kill meters.

116
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,680
So that's our indicator to us that we are still not done with this problem.

117
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
So what do we do?

118
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,150
We do another conversion factor.

119
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,160
What do we have in the bottom over here meters?

120
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,290
Because we know that the two of them will cancel each other out.

121
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,380
We're going to come back over here and look for meters.

122
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,280
Where do we have meters?

123
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,860
Once again, Emmet's miles.

124
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,150
So that's not what we're dealing with.

125
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,470
We have meters over here, but we just use this conversion factor so it doesn't make sense for us to

126
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,150
be using it.

127
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,410
Let's continue down.

128
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,920
Oh, look at this.

129
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,750
We have meters over here.

130
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,260
We have meters over here and we have meters over here.

131
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,860
So consider that we want to get to kilometers.

132
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,040
Which one of these doesn't make sense that we use.

133
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,720
Hopefully you're saying to yourself, let's use the first one.

134
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,390
We have meters over here, kilometers over here.

135
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,530
That makes sense to me.

136
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,500
So how many meters is it?

137
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,510
Oh, it's a thousand meters is equal to what?

138
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:41,380
It's equal to one kilometre are units cancel out, leaving us with kilometres on the top over here.

139
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,850
And we have kilometres on top of.

140
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,940
That's what we're trying to get to.

141
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,670
That's our goal.

142
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,140
So therefore, we know that we're done with this problem.

143
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,380
OK, this is going to get a little bit more complicated.

144
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,760
Put us in the calculator.

145
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,290
But we've been practicing this.

146
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,300
So I think that you're going to be able to do this.

147
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,400
So we have in our calculator, we type it in just like this are open parentheses and we have our ten

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,360
point five just multiplying our numerators times five thousand two hundred eighty times, one times

149
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,690
one.

150
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,680
And what that's going to change the values that we really don't need to be plugged in the calculator

151
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:18,100
divide that by one times, one times three point twenty eight times a thousand.

152
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:24,340
And when we plug this in, we will get sixteen point nine.

153
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,350
And wait a minute, let's look at this.

154
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,420
What are the units that we have?

155
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,710
Well, on the top, we don't have meters.

156
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,460
And I'm sorry, Miles, anymore.

157
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,720
We don't have feet anymore.

158
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,740
We don't have that.

159
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,000
We don't have this in the bomb.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,050
We only had that in the bomb.

161
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:38,770
We don't have this.

162
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,960
The only units that we do have remaining are the kilometers, which is in the numerator.

163
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,870
So therefore, we know it's sixteen point nine kilometres and that's done with that one.

164
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,660
So I'm going to invite you to try out problems six and eight plus the video right now.

165
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,890
Try those out and hopefully you get the answer.

166
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,390
OK, so now we're going to get back into this.

167
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,950
Let's if you didn't pause the video yet to try this out once again, how to encourage that, that's

168
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,600
only going to be the way that you get that you're not going to get better at this by watching me do

169
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,130
this and actually doing this together.

170
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,370
You're just going to get better at this by doing this on your own.

171
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,150
So once again, if you have impressive video, I highly suggest that you do that.

172
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,870
And assuming that you did, let's get into it.

173
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,490
OK, I said problem number six, we have nineteen yards and we're going to get to number of meters.

174
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,360
So once again, right off the bat, I do know that the yards should be the first thing that we cancel

175
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,690
out.

176
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,660
So looking over here, we do see that we have yards over here and we have that's the only spot where

177
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,530
we do have yards.

178
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,510
So let's just go from there.

179
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,720
So we have one yard is equal to three feet.

180
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,440
Our yards cancel out, but we're not happy with it.

181
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,180
We want to get to meters, so let's actually just do another conversion factor looking through here.

182
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,250
We have feet here.

183
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,000
We have feet here.

184
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh, well, we just use that one.

185
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,450
So that doesn't really count.

186
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,560
We're not going to be concerned about that one.

187
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,420
We have feet over here, feet over here.

188
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,380
Once again, we have feet and miles and feet and meters over here.

189
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,310
Considering the idea that we're going to get to our meters, hopefully you're saying to yourself that

190
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,990
we're going to be using this conversion factor so we have feet in the top.

191
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,750
So therefore, we want the bomb in the denominator.

192
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,980
How many feet is it?

193
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,460
It's three point twenty eight feet is equal to what?

194
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,260
It's equal to one meter.

195
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,070
And hopefully by now you're saying to yourself, hey, we want meters and we have meters over here are

196
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,030
indicated to us that we're done with this problem.

197
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,380
And I'm sorry we're supposed to cancel these out guys.

198
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,800
So we just plug this in.

199
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,570
The calculator we do are nine times three and then divide that by our three point twenty eight.

200
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,360
And we got our answer of seventeen point four.

201
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,550
And the only units that we do have remaining here are our meters.

202
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,920
So that's going to be the answer there.

203
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,480
And once again, this is actually to the idea that nine yards is equal to seventeen point four meters.

204
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,840
I do at this point.

205
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,130
I want to stress again the idea that we are not changing the value of the 19 yards.

206
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,900
We're not changing any of these values.

207
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,090
We're simply converting the units.

208
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:24,960
OK, so and this bottom from over here, let's get our 15 kilometres to number miles.

209
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,260
OK, so we have our 15 kilometres over there.

210
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,940
We're going to put kilometres down over here that we're going to have our cancelation going on.

211
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,550
And which one of these bags has to do with kilometres?

212
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,640
Hopefully by now you're saying to yourself, let's look over here.

213
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,960
We have kilometres over there.

214
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,750
And that's the only one that we have to take us from kilometres to meters, not kilometres to miles.

215
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,560
So we do not know that there's going to be a multiple step in here.

216
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,640
So how many kilometres is it?

217
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,890
It's one kilometre.

218
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,540
And that's equal to what a thousand meters are.

219
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,340
Units will cancel out once again, leaving us with meters when we do want our units to be miles.

220
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,260
So we know that we're not done here and we're just going to have to do another conversion unit leaving

221
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,340
us with meters on the bottom.

222
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,820
Over here.

223
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,360
Now, coming through here, let's look at this.

224
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,860
We have meters over here.

225
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,020
We have meters, meters, meters.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,160
Once again, we're not going to be using this one because we just use that because it makes sense for

227
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,450
us.

228
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:27,930
Now, this is where you really have to think about this if we want to go from meters to miles.

229
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,350
Do we want to go from meters to centimeters, meters to millimeters or meters to feet?

230
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,740
This is a little tricky, but hopefully you're saying to yourself it makes sense to go from meters to

231
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,630
feet because Miles is the standard unit.

232
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,350
It's the United States unit.

233
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:56,380
So if we want to go to the U.S. units, we actually do have here this is metric and this is our U.S.

234
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:56,650
unit.

235
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:02,380
This is like a nice little bridge that actually takes us into the U.S. units.

236
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,110
So hopefully that makes sense if it does.

237
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,850
And I apologize and hopefully well, in the upcoming examples, all clear.

238
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,780
Clarify that a little bit more.

239
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,750
Anyway, let's get into this.

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,970
So we have how many meters it's one meter is equal to, what, three point twenty eight feet?

241
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,760
OK, so our units will cancel out and leaving us with feet, but we don't want we want Miles, so we

242
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,370
know that we're actually not done with this.

243
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,020
I know that this is a long problem.

244
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:35,720
But once again, I don't think that's complicated.

245
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,010
It's more complex.

246
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,140
OK, so we have feet down on bottom over here now.

247
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,750
We want to go from feet to miles.

248
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,580
Anthony, I'm sorry, we're going to be just looking at our facts that have to do with feet, so we

249
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,590
have feet over here, feet or their feet and feet, we just use this one so it doesn't make sense.

250
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,180
And those are the only ones.

251
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,800
And hopefully you're saying to yourself, OK, and we have feet and miles over here.

252
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,660
Our goal is to get to Miles.

253
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,610
So it does make sense.

254
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,850
I would be using this fact over here.

255
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,310
How many feet do we have?

256
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,560
We have 4000, 280 feet is equal to what is equal to one mile.

257
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,280
Our feet cancels out, leaving us with miles.

258
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,090
Oh, wait a minute.

259
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,440
Our goal is to actually get miles and we have miles on the top over here indicating to us that we're

260
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,300
done with this problem.

261
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,780
We just need to plug it in the calculator and we're good.

262
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,690
All right.

263
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,230
So just plug in this calculator.

264
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,440
You have five times a thousand times three point twenty eight.

265
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:38,320
Take that divide by two hundred eighty using the same methods that we used before, and we'll get the

266
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
idea that it's equal to three point one miles.

267
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,630
And essentially, once again, this is just saying that the five kilometres is equal to three point

268
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:55,690
one miles for anyone who is who actually runs track or has ever ran a five K before.

269
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,940
Maybe you're saying to yourself, oh, wait a minute, that's what that's about five K a five K race

270
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,250
is equal to three point one miles.
