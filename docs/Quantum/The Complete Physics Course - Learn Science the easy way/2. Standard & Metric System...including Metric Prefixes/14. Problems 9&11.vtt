00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.120
Hey, I just want to actually apologize for the inconsistency of the size of the font, I just really

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.400
want to squeeze this onto one video over here to be able to display all the problems.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.850
But maybe by now you're actually kind of seeing and what these are actually a little bit more complex.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.910
We don't we have more units that we're going to be dealing with.

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.320
So our method on doing this is going to be the exact same.

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.230
Now, I'm just going to write out the first problem and once again, the first the problem number nine

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200
and problem number 11, we're going to be doing together.

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.940
And then from 10 and 12, I encourage you to actually do that on your own.

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.110
So the first problem up here are actually problem number nine.

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.820
I'm just going to rewrite this.

11
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.660
And so this promo here, it's saying let's go from miles per hour, two kilometres per second, so we

12
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.630
have eight miles per hour.

13
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.140
Or just per one hour, and we're can convert this to kilometers per second.

14
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.890
I'm just going to write this over here, kilometres per second.

15
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.280
OK, so what we're going to do with this problem is we're going to first let's come up with a little

16
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.970
strategy.

17
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.440
Let's first convert the units from miles to kilometres and then we're going to convert our units from

18
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.550
ours to second.

19
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.160
So that's going to be our strategy.

20
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.150
We're just going to do this first and then second, and then we're going to be done with our problem.

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.280
OK.

22
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.070
So have you ever thought about this before?

23
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.900
What is it miles per hour actually mean?

24
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.240
Have you ever thought about that?

25
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.400
OK, well, you have it, Miles, which is a distance over a certain amount of time, which is one hour.

26
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.470
So it's eight miles per hour.

27
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.610
If you were traveling at this rate, at this speed for about one hour, how many miles would you go?

28
00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.710
Oh, eight miles.

29
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.990
OK, so that's what the definition of eight miles per hour actually means.

30
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.860
Hey, what say if you actually have a speed of, let's say, 25 miles per hour in one hour, if you're

31
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.010
going at that speed, how many miles will you travel?

32
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.170
You'll travel 25 miles.

33
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.360
That's by definition what it actually means.

34
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.110
All right.

35
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.490
So if you are going eight miles per hour for let's call.

36
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.180
So the speed of eight miles per hour for two hours, how many miles do you travel?

37
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.160
If you're going at that speed for two hours, you will travel 16 miles.

38
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.110
That's by definition, actually what it means.

39
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.270
So anyway, let's get back to this problem and just focus on that.

40
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.070
So, like I said before, we're going to be converting from miles to kilometres and then killed and

41
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.520
then from hours to seconds, that's where our strategy is.

42
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.060
So we're going to be converting and following the exact same method that we were doing before.

43
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.870
So we have miles on top over here.

44
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.210
We're going to be converting to miles and bottom over here and looking through our facts over here.

45
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.960
Hopefully you're actually saying by now recognizing that that's the fact that we actually do have deal

46
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.680
with Miles.

47
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.850
So we're I'm using that.

48
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.560
And once again, we're really focusing on the idea that we're going to be converting to kilometers per

49
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.170
second.

50
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.660
OK, so we have how many miles?

51
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.580
It's one mile is equal to, what, five thousand hundred eighty feet?

52
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.600
80 feet.

53
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.870
Our units here cancel out, leaving us with.

54
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.970
Feet per hour.

55
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.220
That's what we have, we have our feet and we have our those are the two units that we're left with.

56
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.880
We don't want people per hour.

57
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.880
We want kilometres per second.

58
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.080
So just deal with our kilometres first.

59
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.160
We have feet.

60
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.170
OK, so we know that we're not done yet.

61
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.290
OK, so let's look at this over here.

62
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.030
We have 15 inches in yards, 39 meters.

63
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.340
So if we want to go from feet to kilometres, it makes a lot of sense for us to actually go for two

64
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.890
from feet, 10 meters first.

65
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.170
So we have our feet down here.

66
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.180
And how many feet is it?

67
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.800
It's three point twenty eight feet is equal to one meter.

68
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.570
Once again, we don't want meters.

69
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.900
We want kilometres.

70
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.450
So looking at this once again, what has to do with meters?

71
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.820
We have meters over here, meters, meters, meters.

72
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.230
The one that has to do with kilometres is this one.

73
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.610
So that would actually make sense that we're using that.

74
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.940
And how many meters is it?

75
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.140
It's a thousand meters is equal to one kilometre.

76
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.900
Our units cancel out once again.

77
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.120
The idea that we want our kilometres so we are goal is to actually get to kilometers.

78
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.580
We do have kilometres up here and it came to us that we're done with this part of the problem.

79
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.870
We're not fully done yet because we have kilometers up here and ours down here.

80
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.880
We don't want to kilometres and hours.

81
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.890
We want kilometres and seconds.

82
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.060
So our first step is done.

83
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.950
Now, let's go from hours to seconds.

84
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.180
OK, so we do have our hours on the bottom over here.

85
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.710
So we have to think about this.

86
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.440
How do we actually cancel our hours if they're in the denominator in the bottom?

87
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.920
So if we put ours and the bottom over here.

88
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.580
Well, we have ours on the bottom hours, son does see those actually cancel out now, hopefully that's

89
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.190
what you're saying and you agree with that.

90
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.950
But if we have hours and hours on the top, then they will cancel out.

91
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.000
It's the same strategy.

92
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.600
It's the same method that we're doing.

93
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.260
But we just have to think about how our units will cancel out.

94
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.070
We have hours and bombs, therefore ours will be on the top.

95
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.340
Those two will cancel out.

96
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.090
And keep in mind once again that we're going to go from hours to seconds.

97
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.550
And so we have hours over here.

98
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.490
Once again, we have ours over here.

99
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.170
Does it make sense for us to go from hours to days or hours to minutes, consider an idea that we want

100
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.060
get two seconds?

101
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.370
Hopefully you're saying to yourself by now, it makes sense for us to go from hours to minutes using

102
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.750
this factor over here.

103
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.280
How many hours is it?

104
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.680
It's one hour is equal to, what, 60 minutes or an hour?

105
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.990
Hours will cancel out, leaving us with minutes.

106
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.070
But we don't want minutes.

107
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.030
We want seconds.

108
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.800
So therefore, we're come back over here and looking at which ones have to do with minutes.

109
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.200
These two over here and we see that we have our minutes in seconds over here.

110
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.520
So it would make sense that we're dealing with that.

111
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.900
Once again, we have our minutes on the bomb over here.

112
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.520
So how to be kinzler or minutes?

113
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:48.040
Hopefully you're saying we want the minutes on top so our units will cancel out.

114
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.910
And so once again, we have how many minutes is it?

115
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.420
It's one minute is equal to, what, 60 seconds?

116
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.120
Our minutes on the bottom will coincide with the minutes on top, leaving us with seconds and that's

117
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.690
our goal.

118
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.940
That's what we're trying to actually get.

119
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.530
So we do that's our indicator that we're done with this problem, keeping in mind that once again,

120
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.000
we do have our.

121
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:21.140
Kilometres and seconds, those are the only two units that we do have on this entire problem over here,

122
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.060
if you're looking at all the numerators, all of our units are gone except for the kilometres.

123
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.230
If you're looking at all the denominator's, the only units that actually remains is the seconds.

124
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.100
So that's our indicator that we're done with this problem.

125
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.700
All we have to do is plug the calculator to get our answer.

126
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:48.860
Which is our zero point zero zero three six hour up.

127
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.980
Kilometres per second.

128
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.510
And that's what eight miles per hour is equal to.

129
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.690
OK, so let's jump down to pump number 11.

130
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.480
And this is a war problem.

131
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:08.420
And it's you know what the most confusing part about this is actually just looking at the universe.

132
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:16.730
But OK, so we have a velocity of rocket required to reach space is seven point nine kilometers per

133
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.080
second.

134
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.510
Let's convert this into miles per hour.

135
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.960
That's what MPH actually is.

136
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:27.830
I know that we said before that M is referring to meters, but in this context and that's referring

137
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.590
to miles per hour.

138
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:37.220
So that's the tricky part of this, which is the reason why I included this problem in this worksheet

139
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.770
is basically to stump you up.

140
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:46.100
Hopefully you do know that MPH is miles per hour and a lot of people here in the United States would

141
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:46.920
recognize that.

142
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.930
So hopefully that is something that you're used to seeing.

143
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:59.510
OK, so once again, we just have here are seven point nine kilometers per one second.

144
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:08.760
Our strategy once again is we're going to go from kilometres to miles and then from seconds to hour.

145
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.250
So this is this is just the same thing over here.

146
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.840
We have miles per hour.

147
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.220
We have miles per hour.

148
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.280
OK, so let's.

149
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.280
OK, so let's just do that.

150
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:30.870
Let's go and let's convert our units from kilometers per two miles.

151
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.340
So we know that our kilometres are is going to be the first thing that we want Kinslow.

152
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.350
So we're on here.

153
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:40.580
Do we actually see KmH?

154
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.190
Hopefully by now you're sitting right there.

155
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:48.950
So keeping in mind that we're going to go from kilometres to miles so we could go from kilometres to

156
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:49.640
meters.

157
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:55.910
And then hopefully you're kind of thinking yourself, maybe we could go from meters to feet and then

158
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.860
feet to miles.

159
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.540
That's kind of just that's the path that we're going to be taking here, if that was a little confusing.

160
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:03.800
I apologize.

161
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.270
But that's kind of like that's the path that we're going to be taking now.

162
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.990
So we have kilometres.

163
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.580
We're going to be doing this one.

164
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.810
How many kilometres is it?

165
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.060
It's one kilometre.

166
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:15.290
And that's equal to what?

167
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.870
That's equal to a thousand meters.

168
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.650
Our units cancel out, leaving us with meters.

169
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.120
But once again, we don't want meters.

170
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.170
We want miles.

171
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.470
So indicated to us that we're not done with this problem just yet.

172
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.340
And which which are taxis over here to have to do with meters.

173
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:32.270
This one.

174
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:33.020
This one.

175
00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.610
This one and this one.

176
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.590
Hopefully by now you're actually seeing yourself.

177
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.620
It wouldn't make sense for us to use that one being that we should just use that.

178
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.230
And does it make sense for us to go from meters to seven meters?

179
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.750
Mm mm.

180
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:50.660
Four meters to feat, considering the idea that our goal is to actually get to Miles.

181
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.670
Hopefully you're saying to yourself.

182
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:57.320
And what I do know, the idea that Miles is U.S..

183
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:07.020
SIST, United States system measurement and same thing with feet over here, so that's our initial clue

184
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.070
that we're going to go from my from meters to feet.

185
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.240
OK, so if we have meters on here, how many meters is it?

186
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.170
It's one meter.

187
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.970
And that's equal to, what, three point twenty eight feet?

188
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.870
OK, so once again, we have our cancellation and now we're in FT, but once again, we don't want Ft.

189
00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.580
We want our miles.

190
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.070
So come back over here.

191
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.580
Where do we have feet?

192
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.960
We have 50 feet and feet and we have feet and miles.

193
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.530
So hopefully by now you're actually saying that we have we're going to be dealing with that one.

194
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.860
How many feet is it?

195
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:53.370
5000, 280 feet is equal to what one mile units will cancel out, leaving us with miles.

196
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.880
Oh, look at this.

197
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.130
That's our goal.

198
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.240
So we know that we're actually done with this part of the problem.

199
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:06.110
OK, so looking at this right now on the numerators, the only units that we have right now is Miles.

200
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:09.710
And if you look at the denominator's, the units that we have is seconds.

201
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.660
But we don't want seconds.

202
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:11.540
We want ours.

203
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.820
Let's just go through and continue this.

204
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.790
So once again, we have seconds in the bottom.

205
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.450
How do we get how do we cancel out our units of seconds if they're in the bottom?

206
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.200
We we want the seconds to be on the top in the numerator.

207
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:29.150
So where do we see on here that we have our seconds?

208
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.180
Hopefully we see that right there.

209
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.970
And does it make sense for us to go to seconds to minutes?

210
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.830
Yeah, you know what?

211
00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.390
Because our end goal is to actually get to our hours.

212
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:41.780
So how many seconds is it?

213
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.000
It's 60 seconds is equal to what?

214
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.470
One minute?

215
00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.470
Cancel out our units over here and we're left with minutes.

216
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.590
We're not happy with minutes.

217
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.670
We want our hours.

218
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.960
So once again, we're just going to be looking at this, saying that, hey, we have minutes here,

219
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.680
hours here.

220
00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:00.140
That's going to be clearly the fact that we're going to be using.

221
00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:07.730
And how do we Canterlot, if we have our minutes in the bottom or we want our minutes on the top and

222
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:13.750
we have our 60 Minutes is equal to one hour, so our units will cancel.

223
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.620
We have this canceling of that.

224
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.370
And once again, we had our goal of actually getting to our hours.

225
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.600
We have our hours right there.

226
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.940
And if you look on the top in all the numbers, we have our miles, all the denominator units.

227
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.240
We have our hours indicated to us, hey, and what we can play this problem.

228
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:35.360
Once we plug this into the calculator, we should be able to get this answer right here.

229
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:45.700
OK, so at this point, I want you to pause this video and try this problem on your own.

230
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.230
This video is getting a little long.

231
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.900
So I'm actually just going to cut this short right now and we'll continue in the next video.
