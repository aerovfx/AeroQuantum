1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,210
All right, so for these problems over here, this next one, we have five pounds, two number of kilograms

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,820
once again, that what we're going to be doing here is simply just writing out our five pounds.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,650
And we're going to be multiplying this by a fraction, a unit conversion so far over a step over here

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,810
is trying to look for all the facts to actually have pounds in them.

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,380
You notice that the first four over here are all having to do with distance.

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,740
So that has nothing to do with pounds.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,230
This over here we have having to do with pounds in these ones over here.

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,410
Once again, these don't have anything to do with pounds or these ones over here.

9
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,800
So we're just simply going to be looking at this first fun fact, this unit conversion over here.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,990
So once again, keeping in mind that the entire idea of this is to actually be able to cancel out the

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,150
units, one kilogram is equal to two point two pounds.

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,120
Where do we want to put the pounds?

13
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,950
Well, we have pounds on the top over here and we want to put pounds on the bottom over here in the

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,690
denominator.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,780
So we have our two point two pounds is equal to one kilogram.

16
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,340
Being at the numerator and denominator are equal to each other.

17
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:21,030
We know by now that, hey, it's essentially multiplying to five pounds by one, which once again does

18
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,390
not change the value of the pounds, the five pounds.

19
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,520
It just simply converts the units.

20
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,130
Once again, what we're gonna do here is we cancel at the pounds with the pounds and that leaves us

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,030
with kilograms.

22
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,850
We are converting from pounds to kilograms.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,080
And that being the case, we know that we're done with this problem.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,860
OK, so once again, all we have to do here is plug this in our calculator.

25
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:51,090
We have our five times one, which is essentially just sell the five divide that by our one times two

26
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,900
point two.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,310
And this will give us an answer when we plug it in the calculator.

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:04,500
This way, we, of course, don't actually need the parentheses in this this problem right now for plug

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,440
it into the calculator, because it's just two different numbers.

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,930
But I typically use parentheses just really to explicitly have it defined.

31
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,330
What we're plugging into the calculator and we get two point two seven repeating.

32
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,130
We could just do two point two seven.

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,910
And once again, the entire reason why we're doing this is because we're doing the unit conversions.

34
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,160
So make sure that you include your units.

35
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,030
And what's again, what this is essentially saying is that five pounds is equal to two point to seven

36
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,330
kilograms, and that's the answer for that one.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,870
OK, so let's do this next from.

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,250
We have two point twenty seven kilograms to number of pounds.

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:58,520
All right, so we once again start off with our two point two seven kilograms times a fraction over

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,790
here.

41
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,760
And we could just simply just do the divide by one over here.

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,330
That's fine.

43
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,520
And once again, we're actually just going to be using the same fun factor over here, the same unique

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,700
conversion, because once again, we're dealing with kilograms and pounds.

45
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,720
These don't have anything to do with kilograms or pounds, neither of these.

46
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,870
So we are just going to be using the same fun fact.

47
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,500
So we have one kilogram is equal to two point two pounds.

48
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,230
We have kilograms, two point two kilograms with the kilograms in the numerator.

49
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,570
So therefore we know right away that we want kilograms in the denominator for these two units to cancel

50
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,110
each other out.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,550
How many kilograms is it?

52
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,120
Oh, it's one kilogram is equal to what, two point two pounds?

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,060
Once again, our units will cancel out with each other, just leaving us with pounds and we're converting

54
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,220
from kilograms to pounds.

55
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,020
So being that we do have our pounds over here, that's a good indicator to us that we're done with this

56
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,530
problem.

57
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,170
All we have to do is put this in the calculator and we'll get our answer cell plug in the calculator

58
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:05,690
we have to point to seven times are two point to divide that by one times one.

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,110
And really this step over here isn't necessary.

60
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,050
We just have our multiplication of.

61
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,160
Two point two, seven times to point two and now give us our answer and plug it into the calculator.

62
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,610
We have our answer of five five what, five pounds.

63
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:33,440
So what we're basically saying here is that two point two seven kilograms is equal to five pounds.

64
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,360
And if you actually noticed this here, hey, look at the similarities over here.

65
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:45,040
We just went from five pounds to number of kilograms and we just went from number of kilograms to back

66
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,990
to number of pounds just basically through the same method.
