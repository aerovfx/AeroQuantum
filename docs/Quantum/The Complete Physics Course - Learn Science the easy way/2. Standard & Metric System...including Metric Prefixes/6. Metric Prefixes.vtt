00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.510
All right, so continuing on, working on getting to our metric prefixes, so the first one over here,

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.760
we have Negga and Negga is referring to one million and that's what the metric prefix actually means.

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.430
And then we have Chelo, which is referring to a thousand.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.740
So if I have one kilometre, how many meters is equal to once again we have one kilo meter.

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.250
So it's basically referring to one thousand meters.

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.480
That's all that really means.

7
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:33.890
Then we have another metric prefix called the Santae and where the actually heard use before.

8
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.000
Maybe you might be thinking, hey Noah, I know that 100 cents are in one dollar or there are a hundred

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.070
years in one century.

10
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.190
So a cent is actually just referring to a hundredth.

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.740
So if we have one meter, how many centimeters is that?

12
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.100
Oh, that's a hundred centimeters.

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.290
Now, if you're looking at a meter stick, you actually do have all those tick marks.

14
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:06.260
I bet you if you were to count up all the centimeters, well, how many centimeters do you think that

15
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.370
actually would be on the meter?

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.880
Hopefully you're saying to yourself right now that there's 100 of them.

17
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.050
Same thing with the.

18
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.270
Mm mm.

19
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.370
Is referring to 1000.

20
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.190
And how many millimeters are there in one meter.

21
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.020
One thousand.

22
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.840
And then we have micro as well.

23
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300
We're not really going to be going into micro possibly.

24
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.160
If we start to discuss waves we'll start to discuss the wave length.

25
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.880
But as of right now, these are just the odd metric prefixes that we're going to be referring to.

26
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.110
So I just want to really clarify it just because I'm talking about the meter.

27
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.440
Here, this actually also does apply to the pharmacist referring to, yeah, the kilogramme, so we

28
00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:02.130
have a thousand grams is equal to one kilogram and same thing with the leaders we actually have a thousand

29
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.380
milliliters is equal to one leader.

30
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.990
So just keep in mind that this actually does apply to the gram as well as leaders.

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.470
And just to wrap this up, one more question I have to ask you.

32
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.770
Is this so for the kilometre?

33
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.020
Would you say that there's a difference between the kilometre and a kilometer?

34
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.890
I'm sure that you've actually heard those two different pronunciations, at least here in the United

35
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.170
States, you have and once again, is there a difference between the kilometre and a kilometer?

36
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.570
And the answer to that is no.

37
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.370
It's just a difference in pronunciation.

38
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:49.150
You have that chelo meter and kill it to just two different ways to pronounce the kilometre.

39
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.980
Those are essentially the same exact thing now.
