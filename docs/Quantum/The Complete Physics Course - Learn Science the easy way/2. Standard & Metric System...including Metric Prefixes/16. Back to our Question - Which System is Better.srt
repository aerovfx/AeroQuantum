1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,740
OK, so I actually did not forget about this question on here what so which system is better, the U.S.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,690
or the metric system?

3
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:17,550
So I'm just going to actually once again invite you to try these problems on your own and try to come

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,740
up with a nice little conclusion here.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,300
What system makes more sense?

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,660
So this video at this time and try out these two problems and try to come up with a little conclusion

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,860
on what your preferences and why.

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,380
So come back into this right now.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,970
I'm just going to kind of breeze through this, as you should by and by now, be able to convert these

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,470
on your own.

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,520
So we do have our 700 centimeters.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,110
We're going to be converting this to number of kilometers.

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,940
So we have our centimeters over here.

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,220
We have.

15
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,830
100 centimeters is equal to one meter, you know, cancellation.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,920
We're not done with this just yet.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,620
We want to get good kilometers.

18
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,780
So we have this one over here.

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,280
We have a thousand meters over one kilometre.

20
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,880
OK, but.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,150
So we are left with our kilometres in the top over here, and it came to us that we're done and we have

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,850
zero point zero zero seven kilometres.

23
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,780
OK, so that's the answer for the first one after plugging the calculator and let's go through the second

24
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,620
one over here.

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,620
What am I doing?

26
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,810
OK, so deal with the insurers from Gadhafi and then from Ft.

27
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:11,050
We're going to Miles, so we have 12 inches, six to one foot.

28
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:21,040
Cancellation and then we have five thousand two hundred eighty three is equal to one mile.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,320
Tour cancellation over here and we get our answer there.

30
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:37,660
OK, so I'm going to have to plug this in the calculator, and this is equal to zero point one one Miles.

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:46,010
OK, so one thing that you might have noticed here is when you're typing this in calculator, maybe

32
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,310
this actually got a little clear to you.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,420
You actually do have on the top here 700 times in one times one and then divide by one hundred, divided

34
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,490
by a thousand.

35
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,810
The product of those two.

36
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,380
And you actually do get an answer, which actually looks very similar to the initial problem over here.

37
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,710
And for this one over here, for the bottom one, we do have our multiplication of 700 on the in the

38
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,880
numerator and then we're multiplying 12 times by this and 280.

39
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,710
Those are those are those are difficult numbers, actually kind of comprehend.

40
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,580
And think about tossing the calculator.

41
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:29,360
It just it just makes a whole lot more sense the the metric system than the U.S. standard system.

42
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,860
And that's a fun factor over here.

43
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,520
To actually go about doing this in an easier way is we have 700 centimeters to a number of kilometres.

44
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,490
OK, so centimeters.

45
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,500
What does that have to do with that?

46
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,540
It has to do with the right and kilometres.

47
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,900
It has to do with a thousand.

48
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,480
Let's take our initial problem and we know that the decimal is there.

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,630
All we have to do is move the decimal place over how many times?

50
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,190
One, two, three, four, five.

51
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,900
So one, two, three, four, five.

52
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,910
Fion are zeros.

53
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:11,530
And we get our answer, look how simple that is, the whole reason why we're able to do that is because

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,180
the the metric system actually works with a base ten system.

55
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,670
And the the U.S. system clearly doesn't do that.
