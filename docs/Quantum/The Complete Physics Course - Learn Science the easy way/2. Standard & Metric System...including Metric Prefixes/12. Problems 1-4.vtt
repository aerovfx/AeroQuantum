00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.040
OK, so first things first, I'm sure that you actually just recognize right now that your she looks

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.020
a little bit different than mine.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.390
Maybe I'll actually update yours in the near future.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.220
But you actually see that and what mine actually does have these unique versions over here.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.030
So I'll just actually be referring to these as we're going through these problems.

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.180
The first the first problem and the third problem.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.560
We're going to do these together.

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.460
And then the second problem and the fourth problem, I'm going to invite that you do those on your own.

9
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.240
So let's start with the first problem over here, which is 50 kilograms.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.530
And once again, we're actually going to go from kilograms to number of pounds.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
So the very first thing is we're just going to write this out like this.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.300
Just write down or 50 kilograms.

13
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.430
We could do the division of one over here as well.

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.100
And so we won't go from kilograms to number of pounds.

15
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.420
So none of these first effects over here give us what we want.

16
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.990
So we do have kilograms over here and we do have no pounds.

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.090
And if we actually just remember this over here, we do have a thousand grams is equal to one kilogram.

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.630
But if we're going to go from kilograms to number of pounds, would we rather use this fact or this

19
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.290
vector over here?

20
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.370
And once again, just kind of just going through these other ones and just saying, hey, you want none

21
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.790
of those actually have to do with kilograms either.

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.710
So none of those actually will help us out doing this problem.

23
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.730
But which one of these two would it make sense for us to actually use?

24
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.660
Hopefully by now you're actually saying this one, because we're actually going from kilograms to number

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.320
of pounds.

26
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.270
So we will be using this fact to help us out.

27
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.140
So on the top over here, we do have kilograms.

28
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.240
And so therefore on the bomb, we want kilograms to help us out with this unit cancellation.

29
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.070
And how many kilograms is it?

30
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.510
Well, it's one kilogram is equal to two point two pounds.

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.730
OK, so our units will cancel out.

32
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.490
We're trying to get our pounds and we have pounds over here.

33
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.060
So therefore that's indicated to us that that we're done with this problem.

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.640
And once we type, once we actually get this into our calculator, we do 50 times the two point two

35
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.600
pounds and we'll get 110 pounds.

36
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.830
And once again, it's basically just telling us that 50 kilograms is equal to 110 pounds.

37
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.460
If you notice over here, I actually do have the answers and I give them to you.

38
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.950
And you might be saying to yourself, hey, wait a minute, why are you giving us the answers to these

39
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.410
problems?

40
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.210
And the entire point of this is to actually see how you get to the answer, not the idea that, hey,

41
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.340
and what you can actually just point this through this and be like, hey, you know what?

42
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.180
That's my answer and that's my answer.

43
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.870
And that's my answer.

44
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.610
No, it's how do you get to that answer?

45
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.160
And this is a very common practice.

46
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.200
Where in the back of your textbooks, I'm not sure if kids these days actually do have textbooks anymore.

47
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.920
I know that a lot of these are actually online, but a lot of the times answers, for instance, are

48
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.560
given to you and all of your other different subjects.

49
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.010
So for me to actually be giving me the answers here, it's how and what how did you get to it?

50
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.070
Were you able to plug these two numbers into the calculator and actually get the idea that's 10, 110

51
00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.550
pounds?

52
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.790
And hopefully you're saying to yourself, yes, OK, so once again, I am going to actually invite you

53
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.990
to do this on your own.

54
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.830
But I'm just going to jump ahead and actually go to problem number three right now.

55
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.210
So we have zero point two five kilograms and we're going to be multiplying this by hand.

56
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.810
What are a raft that I already know that I want to be canceling out or kilograms.

57
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.580
So we have kilograms down here.

58
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.560
I already know that that's going to be the case because the entire point of this is to actually be canceling

59
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.280
our units.

60
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.950
So we want to be going from kilograms to number of grams.

61
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.930
And once again, when we go through our bags over here, we do see that, hey, we have kilograms over

62
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.410
here.

63
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.360
And once again, the idea that a thousand grams is equal to one kilogram.

64
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.580
So we have kilograms over here as well.

65
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.370
And none of these other factors actually have to do it with kilograms.

66
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.650
So does it make sense for us to actually use this one or this one right one right here?

67
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.630
So hopefully by now you're actually saying, hey, Norway, it does have to do with kilograms and grams.

68
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.870
And the idea is that we convert this to number of grams.

69
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.870
So how many kilograms is that?

70
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.600
It's one kilogram is equal to, what, a thousand?

71
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.160
Gramp's.

72
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.840
Our units will cancel it out.

73
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.160
We're going from kilogrammes to grammes and we actually have Grahame's over here indicating to us that

74
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.150
we're done with this problem.

75
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.030
When we played this in the calculator, we do two point twenty five times a thousand.

76
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.210
And once again, plug this in the calculator, make sure that you actually get the sensor, not just

77
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.890
looking over here and saying, oh, I got it.

78
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.700
Now plug this in the calculator, make sure you get 250 grams.

79
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.420
And that's going to be the best way for you to practice this.

80
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.310
So zero point two, five times a thousand.

81
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.040
And we will get the idea that that's equal to 250.

82
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.500
And what are the units?

83
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.690
It's grammes.

84
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.050
All right, so once again, just pause this video and try to do proms two and four by herself and unpause

85
00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:00.430
the video and we'll do these problems together to make sure that you got them right and for you to check

86
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.460
to see that you got it right.

87
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.870
Hopefully you plug it into the calculator and get these answers.

88
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.320
So plus this video now and in a second will actually come back here and continue this video.

89
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.110
OK, so hopefully you actually did pass the video, you tried it on your own, I'm just going to go

90
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.900
through these two problems right now and we have 100 feet.

91
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:28.240
Well, let's first erase this so we have 100 feet multiplied by our unit conversion.

92
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.220
And we already know that we want feet down here in the bottom for the cancellation and which one of

93
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.790
these has to do with feet, we want go from feet to meters.

94
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.050
Let's keep that in mind.

95
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.800
So we have feet over here, feet over here, feet over here for you over here.

96
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.950
But only one of these actually has to do with meters.

97
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.600
And that's this one over here.

98
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.210
We could say to ourselves, hey, we need to check the rest of these over here because we already have

99
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.220
feet and meters.

100
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:58.400
That's a good indicator to us that we have our dock that we're going to be using.

101
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.660
So how many feet is it?

102
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.450
Oh, it's three point twenty eight feet is equal to what?

103
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.120
Oh, that's equal to one meter.

104
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.680
So we're going to do our cancelations over here.

105
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.930
We have to cancel out the feet over here and we're going from feet to meters and we have meters on top

106
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.600
over here indicating to us and what we're done with this problem.

107
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.590
All we have to do is play this in the calculator and make sure that we get our answer.

108
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.210
So we do in the calculator once again, 100 times one.

109
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.930
Well, you don't really need to do that and divide that by that three point twenty eight.

110
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.480
And that's the way you plug it into the calculator.

111
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.100
Once again, I'm just using the parentheses to explicitly define that.

112
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.640
That's it just helps us out to finding that that's what we want our calculator.

113
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.780
So when we do this, we actually do get our thirty point five meters.

114
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.770
And once again, our thirty point five meters is equal to our hundred feet.

115
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.970
And that's what that means.

116
00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:00.240
OK, so hopefully you got that, if not, that's OK and let's just go into the next problem.

117
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.270
So ideally by now, these concepts are actually getting more and more clear to you.

118
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:10.780
If they're not, I would actually just go back and actually watch this video, as was the previous video,

119
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.130
and just make sure that these concepts are clicking because once again, these problems will get more

120
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:15.700
complex.

121
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.620
And it's very important that you actually do understand the basics before moving on to those problems.

122
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.220
All right.

123
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:27.850
So without further delay, let's actually go into the next problem, which is eight eighty nine hundred

124
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.680
millimeters.

125
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.700
Times our conversion factor, and we already know that we're going to be wanting to cancel our MM.

126
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.350
So therefore we want the MMS on the bottom like that.

127
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.720
And which one of these actually has to deal with MMS.

128
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.000
Let's actually just look at them and we do see as we're going down, going down and we do see our MMS

129
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.940
over here, that's the only one that does and that has to do with meters.

130
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.790
And we are converting from meters to I'm sorry, from.

131
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:53.990
Mm mm.

132
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.910
So it does make a lot of sense that we'd be using this fact.

133
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.140
So how many MMS is it.

134
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.270
Hopefully by now you're saying, oh it's a thousand.

135
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.800
MMS is equal to what.

136
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.640
It's equal to one meter.

137
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.370
Once again, our units do cancel out and we're left with meters.

138
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:14.300
We're going from MMS to meters and we have meters on the top over here giving us the indication that

139
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.770
we are also done with this problem.

140
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:22.850
When we do this division over here, we do get the answer of eight point nine meters and basically just

141
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.500
telling us that eighty nine hundred MMS is equal to eight point nine meters.
