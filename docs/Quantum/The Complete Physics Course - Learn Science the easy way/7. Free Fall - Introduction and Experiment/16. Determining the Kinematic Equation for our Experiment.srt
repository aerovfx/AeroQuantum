1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,240
These are kinematic equations from before, keep in mind, we were using position in the X axis because

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,610
we had objects that were moving in the X axis.

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,980
Now we're going to be having objects are falling and moving it in the y axis.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,090
So instead of using EXI and F, we're going to be using Y and Y F instead of referring to this as position,

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,390
we're going to be referring to it as height.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,040
And doesn't that make sense and everything else is the same, that we're really not going to be talking

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,910
much about average velocity.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,580
Just want to give you a little heads up on that.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,630
So all of these kinematic equations, they're going to be the same.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:43,350
But wherever we do see in Zeph and in EXI, we're just gonna be replacing it with Y and why F.

11
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,500
And here we go, skim through this, and you're able to see instead of having to, we do have these

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,340
substitutions here.

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,340
OK, so now we're at the point in this experiment where we could be determining which equation we want

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,710
to use.

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,620
Once again, like I said before, we're not going to be dealing a lot with our average velocities here

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,480
in free fall unless it really asks very explicitly we're not going to be dealing with these average

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,410
velocity problems.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:15,020
But let's come through here and look for all the equations that do have the F in it and exclude them

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,630
for the equations that we want to be using.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,860
So we have the F right here.

21
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,420
We know we're not going to be using that one coming through here.

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,490
Do we have the math?

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,480
Yep, we have the effort.

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,790
They're not going to be using that one.

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,470
Do we have the F in here now?

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,140
No, we don't.

27
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,160
And we have AVF right here.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,720
So we know that we're going to be using equation number five to calculate our acceleration.
