00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.930
Now that we are convinced that our object is accelerating, let's try to figure out what that acceleration

2
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.270
is.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.790
So let's let's set up an experiment.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.770
Let's do something to try to be able to calculate how fast this object is accelerating.

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.380
Let's think about this here.

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.330
How do we go about setting up an experiment, trying to calculate this out?

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.070
Well, let's simply let's drop the box.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.730
Let's drop an object.

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:35.430
OK, so if we're to do that, if we're to do this right now, what we can do is we could pull out given

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.200
information that we do have.

11
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.600
So what information would be relevant?

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:46.360
Well, I think it would be relevant to actually know the initial height of the box and the final height

13
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.040
the box will be down here.

14
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.360
So the initial height and the final height.

15
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.520
So, OK, it it'll be interesting to know the initial height of the box and also the final height of

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.270
the box.

17
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.190
What about the initial velocity of the box?

18
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.380
Well, if we're just letting it go, how fast is it originally going?

19
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.460
Well, it's not it's not like I'm going to be throwing the bucks down or throwing the bucks up and then

20
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.130
letting it hit the ground, I'm just going to be letting it go.

21
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.010
So if that's the case, what's the initial velocity?

22
00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.020
Oh, it would just be zero.

23
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.570
OK, so we're starting to fill in some given information that we'll have.

24
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.180
Oh, what's going to be the final height in the box as it hits the ground?

25
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.460
That's going to have a final height of zero.

26
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.270
OK, final velocity.

27
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.280
What's the velocity that the box will have as it strikes the ground?

28
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.790
It's going to strike the ground with a certain velocity.

29
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.020
I'm not saying when the box hits the ground and it's on the ground, what's its velocity?

30
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.490
The velocity?

31
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.100
The final velocity would be the velocity at which the box hits the ground.

32
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.240
That information, I don't think that will be able to know that.

33
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.540
And what I'm actually not concerned about that piece of information.

34
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.790
So maybe that's the one that's a piece of information that we simply just don't care about.

35
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.600
OK.

36
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.200
OK, and then our acceleration, this is what we're interested in, right?

37
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.480
So that's what we're going to be finding and the time elapsed.

38
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.430
OK, so picture this.

39
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.470
If you're standing up in your room right now and you're going to be doing this experiment, is there

40
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.450
a way for us to be able to find out how much time has elapsed when you're conducting this experiment?

41
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.920
Well, yeah, you can actually just use a stopwatch, maybe on your cell phone.

42
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.420
Or if you do have a hand-held stopwatch, which I don't really know how many people still have those

43
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.930
nowadays.

44
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.990
But either way, though, we can actually we're starting to set up our experiment.

45
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.290
We're going to calculate this using a stopwatch.

46
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.660
And what about our initial height?

47
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.040
OK, so this is something that we are going to be able to determine, hey, what am I going to let the

48
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.600
box this high, maybe a meter off the ground or this height, maybe even just like a half meter or a

49
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.220
quarter of a meter off the ground?

50
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.920
So let me just tell you this.

51
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.450
The higher that we actually have the object, the better.

52
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:23.190
Because if you think about this, if I drop the box from a very low height and I'm trying to time this

53
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.520
out, using my stopwatch, if there's a little bit of error in here, which there will be, and we should

54
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.840
expect that because we're going to be perfect with our stopwatches.

55
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.980
So if we measure out a incorrect time over here, the amount of error is going to be a lot larger than

56
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.400
if we actually do have a higher height where the percentage of error is going to be a lot less than

57
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.470
the errors have will actually see in a lot.

58
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.830
Right.

59
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.390
So let's actually take this object and drop it from a greater height.

60
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.950
So let's take this object and we'll drop it from one point five meters.

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.930
And I'm sure that you're saying to yourself, hey, not this is very similar to what we were doing before,

62
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.710
but instead of using the R axes, we're using wise.

63
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.620
And that's just simply because, hey, not now.

64
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.140
We actually have our access in the Y direction.

65
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.530
And this this object, it's moving in the right direction right now.

66
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.890
Right.

67
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.540
We're not going to be moving it left and right.

68
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.940
It's going to be moving up or down or actually it will just simply be moving down in this situation.
