00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.980
So just to spare you the trouble of actually doing this, I just calculated how many feet are there

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.760
in one point five meters.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:12.120
So I just converted one point five meters to number of feet, four point ninety feet, and then I have

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.260
zero point ninety feet.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.500
I know what that really means.

6
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.590
So let's convert that point ninety feet into a number of inches and we have 11 inches.

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.410
So in other words, we actually have one point five meters is equal to four feet, 11 inches.

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.940
And that's where I'm actually just going to be using to conduct an experiment.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.110
I going to be dropping a book six times from this height.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.430
And I'm just going to be noting the times for each one of these drops.
