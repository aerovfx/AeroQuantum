1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.930
So let's give ourselves a little room and equation number five.

2
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.840
Always make sure that you wrote this formula down correct, as there is a lot of errors that are made

3
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.820
on simple things like Excel and all we have to do is just plug in our information.

4
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.360
As you see over here, we have our zero times is your witness to this is kind of equal to zero.

5
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.910
So I'm just going to have that anymore.

6
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.810
So we have zero is equal to one point five plus.

7
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.390
Hey, let's just do this in the calculator right now.

8
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:55.140
So we have one half times that point sixty two squared and we get zero point one nine two two and times

9
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.070
are acceleration.

10
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.520
OK, now we're solving for our acceleration.

11
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.140
We have this term over here and we have another term over here.

12
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.630
Let's get it by itself, by getting rid of this positive one point five.

13
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.220
How do we do that?

14
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.570
Subtract one point five on both sides of the equation.

15
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.930
OK, so now we're here, now we have multiplication of zero point one nine two two.

16
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.980
So how do we get rid of the multiplication of point one on two to divide both sides by point one nine

17
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:27.100
two two, and that gives me a negative seven point eight.

18
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.880
Zero four as my acceleration.

19
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.160
And that's in meters per second squared.

20
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.250
OK, so this is what we calculate it for, our acceleration.

21
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.520
Hey, wait a minute, didn't the reading before tell us that the acceleration is supposed to be negative,

22
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.760
nine point eight meters per second squared?

23
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.520
OK, so.

24
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.770
It's it's in the ballpark.

25
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.380
OK, so we say that we did a pretty good job over here.

26
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.070
Perfect.

27
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.680
No, I wouldn't say so, but yeah, I think that this is pretty good, so.

28
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.980
How come we didn't come up with negative nine point?

29
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.600
Well, first of all, what is this negative representing?

30
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.680
Isn't the object falling down so this is representing the direction of the acceleration downwards?

31
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.950
OK, so why didn't we get this answer?

32
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.150
Why don't we get negative nine point eight, which is what the scientists actually calculate?

33
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.530
Well.

34
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.360
I was doing this experiment by myself, I didn't really have any help not to be making excuses or anything

35
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.200
like that, but I wasn't using the most technical equipment.

36
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.140
And there's human error involved here.

37
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.320
Maybe I didn't start the stopwatch or s the stopwatch at the right time.

38
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.880
So I should have and maybe there was a just a little bit of error involved right there.

39
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.780
All right.

40
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.800
So let's do another experiment right now, huh?

41
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.270
Let's see how much I was off.

42
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:05.210
So obviously the only part that really could be off is the idea that this average time is incorrect.

43
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:13.550
And I want to calculate that I want to see what the time should have been, let's calculate out our

44
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.900
time and.

45
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.840
Let's use the negative nine point eight.

46
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.770
Meters per second squared.

47
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.570
OK, so what time should we have gotten if we still don't care about our final velocity?

48
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.480
Aren't we still going to be using the exact same formula and just trying to determine our Delta T?

49
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.130
Well, yes, so let's do that.

50
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:48.190
So I'm just going to erase all of this right in here, our final height is still zero, our initial

51
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.680
height is still one point five.

52
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.960
Hey, that didn't change our initial velocity.

53
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.860
Hey, I'm not throwing the ball up or down at all.

54
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.000
I'm just letting go.

55
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.080
Times are Delta T WashU we've calculated here.

56
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.820
Usually when I do have a multiplication of a negative number, I will wrap around in parentheses just

57
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.030
so that it's not looking like one half minus negative nine point eight.

58
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.170
I think it's a little bit easier to read if that's the case.

59
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.800
So right here, I've zero times Delta T..

60
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.560
Well, we know that zero times any number is equal to zero.

61
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.880
Some just don't cross it out.

62
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.610
And all we're left with here is this.

63
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.510
Let's, uh, let's simplify this.

64
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.210
Let's what's one half of negative nine point eight?

65
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.350
It's going to be positive times, a negative, positive times, the negative will give us a negative

66
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.870
number, right?

67
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.590
So it's going to be negative four point nine times Delta T squared.

68
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.240
OK, so now let's continue to sell this out.

69
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.810
We want to actually isolate our Delta T squared.

70
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.320
Keep in mind that this is Delta T squared.

71
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.310
OK, so how do we go about doing that?

72
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:09.700
Let's subtract one point five on each side equation, leaving us with this, OK?

73
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.690
And now we have a multiplication of negative four point nine.

74
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.090
So let's divide negative four point nine on both sides.

75
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.340
Equation will have a negative one point five divided by a negative four point nine.

76
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.750
So that will result in a positive answer.

77
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:31.110
And we have zero point three oh six is equal to our Delta T squared.

78
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.620
I don't care what Delta T squared is.

79
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.370
I want Delta T, so how do we get rid of the squared?

80
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.200
Let's take the square root of both sides of the equation.

81
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.060
And this will give us our delta.

82
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:43.910
So what should we've done?

83
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.830
Let's take the square root of this zero point five, five seconds.

84
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.470
That's what we should have gotten in order to get calculate out this acceleration of negative nine point

85
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.760
eight meters per second squared.

86
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.930
So it looks like they want maybe this number wasn't really our outlier.

87
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.500
Maybe it was this one, huh?

88
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.850
I didn't really consider that.

89
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.370
I kind of wonder if we would actually get a better answer if we were to have said that our point six

90
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.430
six was our outlier.

91
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.570
Hmm.

92
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:26.400
Or what you could actually do here to get a better reading is you can actually take not just six recording's,

93
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.540
but take 20 to 40, take 50 to 100, take a thousand.

94
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.890
If you increase the sample size to your accuracy will become a lot greater.

95
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.630
Think about this.

96
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:46.870
By us using Point Sixta, as opposed to zero point five five thousand point zero seven seconds of a

97
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.720
difference, go into your stopwatch and try to see what point zero seven seconds looks like.

98
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.480
And it is such a small difference, even using the wrong allier to cross out.

99
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.790
I think that we did a pretty good job here having a difference of zero point zero seven seconds.

100
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.800
That's not bad.
