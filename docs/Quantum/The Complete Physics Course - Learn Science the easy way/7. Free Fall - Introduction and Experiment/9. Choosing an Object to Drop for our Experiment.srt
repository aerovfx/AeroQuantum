1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,480
So it looks like that the weight of the object or the mass of the object doesn't really have an impact,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,860
it doesn't make a difference.

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,290
So we could use any object here and, well, we should be able to get the same results based on that

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,510
experiment that we just did.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,580
So in other words, we could actually use a book or, hey, know what?

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:26,010
We could actually even use a sheet of paper and drop it and be able to get the same results and be able

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,050
to calculate our acceleration.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,640
Well, wait a minute.

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,200
Maybe you're saying to yourself, I know that if I drop a book and dropping a piece of paper, that's

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,980
not the same thing.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,510
That piece of paper, it's it's not going to fall straight down now, will it?

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,700
What's it gonna do?

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,760
It's kind of like do it's little dance in the air and make its way to the ground.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,110
Right.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,550
Well, why does it do that?

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,530
And then we just say before the idea that the mass of the object or the weight of the object doesn't

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,180
make a difference.

18
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,410
So this how it actually just moves in air, why does it.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,500
Why does it do this?

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,430
It's because it's taking the path of least resistance, what it's having to do is cut in between the

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,680
air molecules that are interfering with the path of the object.

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,590
It has to cut through the air.

23
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,740
The book when going down, hey, and what?

24
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,360
There are air particles that is getting interference with.

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:27,740
Not really.

26
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,290
It's kind of insignificant when it comes to an experiment like this.

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,390
So it's nothing that we actually really have to take account for when we're dealing with an experiment

28
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:44,990
like this, maybe in higher level courses, much higher level courses like graduate college courses,

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,280
you'd have to think about this.

30
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,410
And it's basically because of these air molecules that they have interference.

31
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,540
That's if we drop this book from, let's say, a thousand feet in the air.

32
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:03,570
At a certain point, the book will stop accelerating and it will reach its terminal velocity.

33
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,720
That's a nice little fun fact for you.

34
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,140
It's not going to be actually worked into at all in this experiment.

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,410
We will be using a book as opposed to a sheet of paper.
