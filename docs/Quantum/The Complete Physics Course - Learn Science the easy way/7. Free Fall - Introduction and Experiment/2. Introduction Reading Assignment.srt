00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,470
OK, so now we're going to be discussing Free-Fall.

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,730
Well, actually, before that, what I'm going to say to you is a little bit of a reading summit attached

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,450
to this video is going to be this PDF, this article right here.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,210
I just kind of want you to go through read this.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,210
Trust me, it's just the two pages.

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,330
It shouldn't really take you that long to do.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,070
And alongside of it is a worksheet.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,560
This is a Nessel fill in the blank worksheet as you go on through this worksheet.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,380
It's not really that long either.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,050
It's just that long.

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,650
It won't really take too long to do, but it's just going to be like a nice little different way to

12
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,570
go about introducing a topic here.

13
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,350
So I just want to change it up a little bit for the fill in the blank.

14
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,150
Let me just say this.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:48,360
You're going to go through here and as you're going through here, just lined up is going to be these

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,840
answers.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,530
So as you're going through, as you're going down, you're going to actually start to say, hey, and

18
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,810
what this goes along with it, it goes in the exact same order.

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,740
There is no oh, I have to be come back up here in order to find these answers are coming all the way

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,090
down here to find an answer that is up here now.

21
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,040
Just it scrolls down.

22
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,970
It goes through this.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:10,590
Try this out.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,090
Attached to this.

25
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,790
The video will also be an answer key.

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,650
So if need be, if you actually want to just check your answers and Hanwha actually have over here.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,120
Hey, it's going to be so for this part, it's going to be one, two, three, four words.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,660
This over here.

29
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,250
I'm looking for two words and four words over here.

30
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,700
So it's it's pretty simple, pretty straightforward.

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,340
This shouldn't take you any longer than maybe like 10 minutes to complete or so any longer than that.

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,010
You're probably spend too much time with it.

33
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,810
So compare answers to the answer sheet and collect your.
