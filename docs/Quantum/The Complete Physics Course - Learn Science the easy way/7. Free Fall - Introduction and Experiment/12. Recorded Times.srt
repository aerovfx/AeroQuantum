1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,080
So now I'm back.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,810
I actually just literally took my ticket textbook, dropped it from four feet, 11 inches off of the

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,220
ground six times.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,190
And these are my recordings.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,100
So if you want, you can actually conduct this experiment yourself.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,010
This is a lot easier with two or three different people or so.

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,210
Conduct this experiment.

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,640
You can actually do it from a lot higher of a height, maybe like two meters off the ground or 2.5 meters

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,210
up the ground.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,720
Yeah, just kind see if you get the same results for our acceleration.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,060
Where I want to do right now is think about this.

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:38,340
So do we want to use all these numbers for our average or maybe there's a number here that looks slightly

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,540
like an outlier.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,950
Ideally in experiments, what you do is predetermine the number of the sample size that you want and

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,690
then also predetermine if you're going to be excluding any sort of outliers.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,630
So I'm going to calculate the average and I'll be back in a minute.
