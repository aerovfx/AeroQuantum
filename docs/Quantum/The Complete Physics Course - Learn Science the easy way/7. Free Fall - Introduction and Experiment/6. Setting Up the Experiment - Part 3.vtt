Before doing this experiment where I'm going to be dropping a 40 pound in a 15 pound weight from my

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
roof, what I would have to do is I want to make a prediction.

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.740
OK, so what do you think is going to actually hit the ground first?

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.960
Do you think that the 15 pound weight or the 40 pound weight is going to hit the ground first?

5
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.890
And so think about this if need be.

6
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.750
Plus the video.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.010
Give it a little thought.

8
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.150
And I would actually think that most people intuitively would say, hey, no, of course, the 40 pound

9
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.410
weight is going to hit the ground first and then the 15 pound weight.

10
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.400
And the whole reason why you're probably thinking about that is, hey, not this one, this 40 pound

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.110
weight weighs a lot more.

12
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.940
So there's a lot more.

13
00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.400
Downwards force acting on the object versus the 15 pound weight, which is about a third less so.

14
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.320
Of course, this is going to hit the ground bam first and then maybe this one, maybe not exactly that

15
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.830
same amount.

16
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.090
Time span, of course.

17
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.960
But hey, what that would be a very logical reason right there to actually think not that the 40 pound

18
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.790
weight will hit the ground first.
