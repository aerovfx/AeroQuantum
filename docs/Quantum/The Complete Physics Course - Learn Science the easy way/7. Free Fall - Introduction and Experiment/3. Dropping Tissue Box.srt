1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,730
So on my desk right now, I have a tissue box.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm just going to lift up that tissue box and drop it, and then I'm going to lift up that same tissue

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,250
box again and drop it from a different height.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,830
And what I want you to do is tell me your observations and just trust me, just doing exactly what I

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,200
said.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,760
So this is going to be from the lower height.

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,780
And from the higher height.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:31,960
From the lower height, from the higher height, when your observations.

9
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,710
And one thing that you might be saying is one, hey, that's annoying, stop doing that.

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,590
And maybe you're saying that because, hey, from nowhere is it less annoying?

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,940
And you're going to be like, yeah, it is less annoying than from the higher height.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,870
Yeah, it's it's a lot more annoying.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,100
Please stop doing that.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,760
And so, in other words, what's annoying about it?

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,870
Well, because it's the loud right.

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,620
It's louder when it's dropping from a higher height, maybe at a time in the morning.

17
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,090
You're not wanting to have your teacher standing right next to you drop in a box, having that all that

18
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,650
noise coming into your ears.

19
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,380
So, hey, what's the reason why it's louder coming from the higher height, then?

20
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,340
From the shorter height?

21
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,970
Maybe you're saying yourself, well, because it's it's moving faster, that's the reason why it's actually

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,290
creating this of noise, and that's exactly right.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,090
So it is moving faster.

24
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,420
That's the reason why it's created this loud noise.

25
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,910
Now, if it actually does create the same noise from this height as this height.

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:39,880
So if this noise and this noise was the same, maybe you would say, hey, no, it's moving at the same

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,210
speed.

28
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,140
But being at this height, it's moving at a faster speed.

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,570
Hey, what could you actually say that that's that the object is doing?

30
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,030
It's moving faster over a certain amount of time.

31
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:51,850
Right.

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,840
Can you also say that the object is accelerating?
