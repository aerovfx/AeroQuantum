00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,030
So here's a nice little fun fact for you, in an environment where we don't have these air particles

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,730
impeding the objects, most of the emotion of the piece of paper that makes it kind of dance like this

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,610
in a environment where we don't have these air molecules, let's say on the moon or in the vacuum,

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,450
the paper being that there is no air interference.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,390
That piece of paper will fall straight down to the ground because there is no air to actually interfere

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,530
with the objects motion.

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,210
Pretty cool, right?

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:37,660
Well, it is a fun fact, but I wouldn't actually say that's pretty cool, I would actually say, hey,

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,780
not show me show me that it would actually do that.

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,300
The piece of paper would fall straight to the ground if it has none of this air resistance.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,220
So what I want you to do at home is this.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,480
You have your book.

13
00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:00,910
I want you to take a piece of paper, cut it in half and take that piece of paper and place it directly

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,410
on top of the book.

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,170
Make sure that none of the corners are sticking out and drop the book.

16
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:14,860
But before doing this experiment, I want you to tell me, is this so you have your book and you have

17
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,680
your sheet of paper notes that the paper is not having its edges over the size of the book?

18
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,740
Well, I want you to do is tell me this or actually think about this yourself.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,700
Do you think that the book will actually fall and then there will be like left and then the piece of

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,060
paper will kind of have like a little separation in here and the book will actually fall and hit the

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,660
ground first?

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,800
Or will the book and the piece of paper fall and hit the ground together?
