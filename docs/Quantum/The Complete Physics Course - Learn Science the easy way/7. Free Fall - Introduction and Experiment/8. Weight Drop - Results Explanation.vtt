00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.660
So did you see that the 40 pound weight and the 15 pound weight didn't hit at the ground at the different

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.510
times, they actually hit at the ground at the same time?

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.370
So we could say here that they accelerate at the same rate.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.920
We're saying that the 40 pound weight in the 15 pound weight hit at the ground at the same time.

5
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.150
If this was moving faster and hit the ground first the 40 pound weight, then it would have a different

6
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.430
acceleration and the 15 pound weight.

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.090
But being that they moved at the same speed, increasing their speed consistently, they hit the ground

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.890
at the same at the same time.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.040
And we could say that they had the exact same acceleration.
