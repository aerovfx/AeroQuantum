1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,200
We're going to be conducting our experiment very soon, but let's discuss something.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,560
OK, so what's going to happen is I'm going to take this object.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,790
I'm going to have it at one point, five meters high.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,060
We're going to let go of it, have the stopwatch started as soon as I let go.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,590
And then it's going to come down here.

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,430
It's going to hit the ground.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,500
And as soon as I hear it hit the ground, I'm going to stop a stopwatch and I'll record it will be able

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,310
to use our kinematic formulas in order to calculate our acceleration.

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,580
And we're going to be good now.

10
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,470
There's going to be some human error involved here.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,210
If I'm actually just using my trusty stopwatch right now.

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,400
I mean, I'm not going to be doubting the integrity of the stopwatch.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm going to be doubting the integrity of what am I going to be starting and stopping this at the exact

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,970
time that I should be or might there be a little bit of error involved here?

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:55,500
OK, so if we're expecting some error, then what could we do in order to help ourselves out with calculating

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,350
a more accurate time elapsed?

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:03,540
Maybe you're sending yourself instead of one reading where we're going to be calculating at the time,

18
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:10,320
maybe we should actually do it two times or possibly three times or four times and actually just use

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:10,950
those.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,020
OK, so now now we're getting onto the right track here.

21
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,110
So instead of actually just taking one measurement here, maybe we should actually take multiple.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,400
And then once we actually do that, what should we do?

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,920
Well, what actually makes sense for us to do with this multiple time readings are, you know what say

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,290
if we were to take the average of all of these.

25
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,290
And use that number as our Delta T..

26
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,920
OK, that makes a lot more sense, and I like that.

27
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,020
I think that that's exactly what we should do.

28
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,760
So we have our experiment.

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,590
We have everything.

30
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,760
Are we are we ready to go right now or is there anything that we're not exactly considered right now?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,030
OK, well, what about this box?

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:08,580
What would be the difference if I was to actually use a let's say let's say I to use a 40 pound weight

33
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,710
and I have this dumbbell over here.

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,030
What does it look like?

35
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,020
Something like this?

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,790
Yes, sure.

37
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,930
That that's looking about right.

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,250
What if I you use a 40 pound weight instead of my tissue box over here or let's say a new one instead

39
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,320
of a 40 pound weight at the same height, we're going to be using a 15 pound weight.

40
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,920
Is this going to make a difference to us?

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,920
Well, I'm really not sure.

42
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,700
So let's actually do a experiment to see if the mass of the object or the weight of the object will

43
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,530
make a difference in our experiment.
