00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.140
So this is going to be the last problem of this worksheet.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.320
It says you shot a gun straight up in the air with the velocity of 500 meters per second.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.030
How long will it take before it hits the ground again?

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.580
OK, so.

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.560
So the situation is we're shooting guns straight up in the air, actually a bullet, you shot a gun

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.530
straight up in the air.

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.830
All right.

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.400
So I guess it's going to be we shot the bullet straight up in the air and come back down.

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.470
So once again, we're going to be saying that this is our initial position.

10
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.760
This is our final position.

11
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.290
Once again, the whole reason why we like that is because we know that this is going to be equal to

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.920
zero.

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.980
No, that was a bad line right there.

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.590
OK, so what is our given information?

15
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.450
What do we have here?

16
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.120
Um, so what does this 500 meters per second represent?

17
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.110
That's our initial velocity, right.

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.660
And by now, you should know this.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.070
And what's our initial height?

20
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.090
Um.

21
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.590
Does it say anything about the height of the.

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.980
Do we care about the height of this at all?

23
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.760
No, right.

24
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.360
And so I guess that's the thing that we don't care about because it sounds like that where it's asking

25
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.090
how long will it take before it hits the ground again?

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.160
I just want to say that, hey, know what?

27
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.450
If English is your second language, it's very common to actually be phrasing things in the English

28
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.300
language, saying, how long will it take?

29
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.600
And that's basically referring to time.

30
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.160
I know it says a long right here and you might be thinking distance are like a higher sum like that.

31
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.540
But in this context, it says, how long will it take before it hits the ground?

32
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.910
Again, we're referring to the time, another context where you might say, how long will it take?

33
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.400
You might say, how long will it take you to go grocery shopping today or how long will it take you

34
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.680
to walk down the school hall?

35
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.140
And it's just referred to time.

36
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.890
I know it's a little confusing if you're if English isn't your first language, but we are referring

37
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.880
to time, right.

38
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.540
Right now.

39
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.030
So this is the variable that we're trying to find.

40
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.970
OK, so the variable that we simply don't care about.

41
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.570
And by the way, I purposely added this in here just because I know that there is a confusion at times

42
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.930
with that.

43
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.230
So.

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.860
All right.

45
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.940
So the wife is the variable that we don't care about.

46
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.610
Let's come over here and look for all the Wyeth's.

47
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.150
OK, so we got way off right here, and once again, we have way off right there, we're not going to

48
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.100
be using these here and scanning through here.

49
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.050
We have another wife right there.

50
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.480
So we're not going to be using that one.

51
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.140
We're going to be using a question number three to find our time.

52
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.630
The Earth is equal to the our Delta T. Let's do our substitutions right now.

53
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.960
The Earth.

54
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.100
OK, OK, so I guess I could just rewrite this.

55
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.680
Isn't this the same as this?

56
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.650
OK, so we have it rewritten in this form now, once again, we do have two terms over here in terms

57
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.860
of once again separated by plus minus, plus and minus signs.

58
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.840
We have this term over here, which includes the variable that we're trying to solve for.

59
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.640
So let's get rid of this term over here, which is a positive five hundred simply by subtracting 500

60
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.110
on both sides of the equation.

61
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.130
And then we have a multiplication of negative nine point eight.

62
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.210
So how do we get rid of multiplication of negative nine point eight watts by both sides, by negative

63
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.900
nine point eight?

64
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.410
So I'm just going to do this on the calculator.

65
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.580
And if we divide a negative by a negative way, we get positive or negative a positive.

66
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.920
So we have fifty one point zero two.

67
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.700
OK, so let's leave it at 51 seconds.

68
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.530
Is equal to our Delta T..

69
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.810
Oh, wait a minute.

70
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.620
The answer right here saying that's one or two seconds, wait a minute, so what is this?

71
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.450
Fifty one seconds about.

72
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.090
Well, think about it.

73
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.060
What is this representing to us?

74
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.210
Why do we get this answer?

75
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.730
Well, isn't doesn't that represent the time it gets from.

76
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.100
It takes to go from here to here?

77
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.900
Which is our high rise.

78
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.310
And we're trying to find out how long will it take before it hits the ground again?

79
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.010
So we're trying to find out this time the total time.

80
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.000
So our total will just be double this, which is equal to our one or two.

81
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:12.900
So the teetotal.

82
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.010
Is 102 seconds.

83
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.490
And we're done with that problem.
