00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.070
Problem number three, I know that this is going to seem like a silly exercise in a little bit once

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.690
we get the hang of it, but either way, though, this is something that's going to be necessary for

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.100
us to be able to complete the the problems where the object is being thrown directly straight up in

4
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.570
the air.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.090
So it's just saying, hey, let's fill in the missing values.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.570
All right.

7
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.700
So for the first ball's trajectory, where it gets thrown straight up in the air and it comes straight

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.570
down, it's going to be in the air for a total of eight seconds.

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.480
OK, so that being the case, if it's in the air for eight seconds, one, two, three, four, five,

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.560
six, seven, eight.

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.360
What is it how much time does it take to rise from being on the ground all the way up to the maximum

12
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.750
height?

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.340
Well, if it's in the air for a total of eight seconds and we know that the object trajectory is symmetric,

14
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.120
well, then we know that the object will take four seconds for it to rise, although up to maximum height

15
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.530
as well as they'll take another four seconds for it to fall from the maximum height that onto the ground

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.330
or to the level at which it was thrown.

17
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.340
OK, well, what if for this one, it takes two seconds for to go from the ground or the point at which

18
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.000
it was actually launched up in the air all the way to the maximum height?

19
00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.510
How much time does it take for it to fall all the way back down to the ground?

20
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.670
Another two seconds.

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.320
And what's the total time that the ball was in there or the object?

22
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.390
Certainly the hang certainly get the point of this.

23
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.270
So it takes three seconds for the ball to fall, how much time does it take for it to get all the way

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.860
up to the maximum height?

25
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.710
And how long has it been in the air for in total?

26
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.570
OK, and for this last one, five seconds, so it takes two point five seconds for it to get all the

27
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.430
way up to the maximum height and it takes two point five seconds for the object to fall.

28
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.420
We'll see the relevance in this and when we start doing these problems.
