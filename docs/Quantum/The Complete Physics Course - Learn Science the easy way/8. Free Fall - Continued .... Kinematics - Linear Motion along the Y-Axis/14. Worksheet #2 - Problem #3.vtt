00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.970
The problem number three, you throw rocks up in the air as hard as you can, it stays in the air for

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.960
a total of six seconds.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.220
What was the velocity of the rock when you throw it?

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.320
OK, so we're throwing a rock straight up in the air.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.650
It's staying in the air for a total of six seconds.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.200
OK, so it's kind of just pretty straightforward telling us that our T total.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.570
Is six seconds.

8
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.970
OK, so once again, if this is our initial this is our final position, what's once again we're going

9
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.310
to be using that because we like the idea that our final velocity here is equal to zero meters per second.

10
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:54.370
Then what is the time for it to rise up to the point of the tickets to the highest point?

11
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.850
That's going to be equal to three seconds.

12
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.760
By now, you should be definitely picking that up.

13
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.560
OK, so what's the initial hype?

14
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.730
And where are we trying to find here?

15
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.460
What was the velocity of the rock when you throw it?

16
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.650
Oh, isn't that the the initial velocity?

17
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.050
We know that the final velocity is zero meters per second.

18
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.820
And what is acceleration?

19
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.740
What's the acceleration due to gravity?

20
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.990
And the key from here to here is there are three seconds, do you see how simple it would just be to

21
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.990
take this t this six seconds here and plug it right into here just because you see seconds here and

22
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.570
and what that says to you at the time?

23
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.150
But the fact is that you could actually just be using three seconds, which is half of it.

24
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.950
So you'll get something some.

25
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.010
I don't get stumped up on that, OK.

26
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.710
Does it say anything about the height?

27
00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.860
No.

28
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.150
Right.

29
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.340
So this right here is going to be the variable that we don't care about.

30
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.910
And let's try to look for our equations.

31
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.740
That has to do with the final height.

32
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.340
And I see right here that funnel height right there.

33
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.310
We also have final height right there, pretty quick to identify those two.

34
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.560
And we have our final height right here.

35
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.240
So we know that we are going to be using our third equation.

36
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.080
And don't worry if you feel like that, hey, now, once again, I'm going through another problem with

37
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.330
you.

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.700
I will have plenty of problems for you to be doing on your own soon.

39
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.630
So don't be worrying about that, about not having enough practice problems for yourself.

40
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.490
Simple substitution.

41
00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.180
OK, so we have here we have our negative nine point eight times positive three that will result in

42
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.230
a negative.

43
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.550
Um.

44
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.650
Twenty nine point four add twenty nine point four to both sides of the equation, we get twenty nine

45
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.080
point four meters per second as our initial velocity.

46
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.380
OK, so that's that problem.

47
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.720
And hopefully by now you are getting a good handle on these.
