00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.680
So moving on to problem number three, a brick is being dropped from a high scaffold, what is its velocity

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.760
after four seconds?

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.250
How far does the brick just the brick fall during this time?

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.580
OK, so once again, we're just dropping a brick, right?

5
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.980
What is its velocity after four seconds?

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.600
How far does the brick fall during this time?

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.710
OK, so let's think about it like this.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.620
We have so we're trying to find two things, of course.

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.950
Are we given the initial height of the object of the brick?

10
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.810
No.

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.230
Right.

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.640
So this is a good instance where we could just say that the initial height is zero.

13
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:57.630
Meters, and it's going to fall a certain amount and our final height is going to be our question mark.

14
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.530
OK, so what's this phone archiving information?

15
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.530
So we have zero meters for the height.

16
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.980
Let's.

17
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.790
Our final highlight, the final hit is what we're trying to find, it's asking how far does the brick

18
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.080
fall during this time?

19
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.740
Oh, no.

20
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.060
It doesn't look like that.

21
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.240
The brick is actually indicating that's hitting the ground.

22
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.820
OK, so it's not hitting the ground.

23
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.110
So it's going to be falling.

24
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.410
And now the brickies over here.

25
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.350
After the time span of four seconds, OK, all right, so what is the initial velocity?

26
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.730
Are we through on the break up?

27
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.990
Are we throw the brick brick down, know the initial velocity is going to be zero meters per second?

28
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.870
What is the final velocity?

29
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.800
Oh, that's actually what we're trying to find here.

30
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.970
What is the velocity after four seconds?

31
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.220
So we just have a nice little question mark right there.

32
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.810
What is the acceleration due to gravity?

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.690
By now, you should realize that whenever we're having these objects being dropped or if we are to be

34
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.900
throwing them up in the air, which we will do later on, the acceleration is going to be the acceleration

35
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.560
due to gravity, which is negative nine point eight meters per second squared by now.

36
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.850
I want you to actually make sure that you have this memorized going forward for these free falling objects.

37
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.240
The time, OK, so we are given a time of four seconds.

38
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.820
OK, so we have two things that we're trying to find here, we're trying to find our Wyeth and we're

39
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.550
trying to find our Veth, OK, so which one do we want to find first, Litsa?

40
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.670
What is the velocity after four seconds?

41
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.060
OK, so let's find out what our final velocity is.

42
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.270
So what we're going to do is we're going to say, hey, wherever we DCR Wyeth, we're going to say that

43
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.520
that's going to be a formula that we don't want to use.

44
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.270
So where do we have Wyeth?

45
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.500
Oh, we don't have Wyeth over here, but we have Wyeth right here now going to use that one.

46
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.720
We have Wyeth right there and I can use that one.

47
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.770
And coming through, we got Wyeth right there.

48
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.740
So to find our final velocity, we're going to use equation number three.

49
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.610
And what's nice about this, which I always love, is that we won't even need to have to solve for our

50
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.600
variable because it's already on the left hand side the equation by itself.

51
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:44.000
So we have our negative nine point eight times are for obviously this provides us no values, so we

52
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.530
don't need to plug that into the calculator.

53
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:54.770
Now we have our value, our value of three thirty nine point two metres per second, and that's our

54
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.640
final velocity.

55
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.840
Once again, the net negative indicate the idea that we're going downwards.

56
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:01.200
OK.

57
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.110
And I'm just going to get rid of our diagram right now.

58
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.550
Beautiful, beautiful drawing there.

59
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:15.260
So now let's get our why if so, if we're looking for a Y, if I'm just going to say I don't care about

60
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.820
Veth.

61
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.650
OK, so once again, we don't care about VIth.

62
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.380
Oh we got Veth right here.

63
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.750
I'm going to use this equation.

64
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.970
Do we have the F over here.

65
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.450
Oh yeah.

66
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.790
Yep.

67
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.630
We got the effort there so we're not going to use this equation and we have the F over here.

68
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.570
No we don't.

69
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.230
OK and we have Geoffrey here so we're not gonna use this equation.

70
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.480
Process of elimination once again helps us out, indicating to us that we're going to be using equation

71
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.500
number five to find our V our why f our final height and which is nice about this, is that we're we're

72
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.160
already isolated our variable, our y f so all we have to do is play this in calculator and we'll get

73
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.700
our answer.

74
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.720
OK, so once again, make sure that you wrote down the road and the equation correct and I think that

75
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.920
we're looking at here.

76
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.590
So let's plug this in.

77
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.430
We have this hour why I is zero.

78
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:27.380
I'm just looking over here and our initial velocity is zero times our Delta T, which is four plus or

79
00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.660
one half negative.

80
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.890
Nine point he.

81
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.780
Times are four.

82
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.480
And don't forget to square that value is this T squared?

83
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.860
I'm not going to bother writing this in and we have zero times any number is going to equal to zero,

84
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.880
so all we have to do is plug in one half of negative nine point eight times four squared.

85
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.120
So we should be looking at this right now.

86
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.070
We're expecting to get a negative value right now.

87
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.260
Right, because a positive times, a negative times, a positive will result in a negative value.

88
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:15.240
And when we plug this in, we'll get negative seventy eight point four metres, always plug the same

89
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.990
to the calculator.

90
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.890
Don't assume that you're just going to get this answer, OK?

91
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.580
And that's that.
