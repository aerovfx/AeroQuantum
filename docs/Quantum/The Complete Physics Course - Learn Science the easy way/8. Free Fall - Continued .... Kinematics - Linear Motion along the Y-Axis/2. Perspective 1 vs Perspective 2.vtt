00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.780
Before going into any sort of practice problems, I do want to cover this right now.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.290
Don't skip over this video.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.770
Watch his explanation if need be.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.760
Watch it twice.

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.450
OK, so see if we have a scenario where Iraq is being dropped off of a 85 metre high cliff.

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.580
I'm going to call this perspective one and perspective two of this happening.

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.560
So let's say this.

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.910
Let's say that your buddy over here, he's on a cliff and he's saying to you, hey, check me out,

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm up on a cliff, I'm going to drop this rock.

10
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.560
And you're all the way down here and you're observing this.

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.890
You're saying, hey, look, that's a really high cliff right there.

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.090
So what would you say is the initial height of the object?

13
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:44.060
OK, it's 85 meters high and all the way down here when it hits the ground, what would you say is the

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.860
final height of the object?

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.300
Well, if it's hitting the ground where it makes sense that it's zero meters high.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240
OK, so that's perspective number one.

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.210
What about perspective number two?

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.010
How could I change this right now?

19
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.760
Well, say, if your buddy over here, he's saying, hey, check me out, I'm about to drop this rock

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.150
off of a cliff and instead you're now.

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.530
On a little red boat sand yourself.

22
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.720
Oh, that's pretty cool.

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.600
Well, check me out.

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.090
I'm on a boat and your buddies like, hey, check me out once again.

25
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.860
I'm going to drop this rock off this cliff.

26
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.800
And what we could call even a whole.

27
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:36.080
So what would you say is the initial height of the object now keeping in mind that this is ground level?

28
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.370
OK.

29
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.570
This is now zero meters high.

30
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.150
And what would you say the final height of the object is as it hits the bottom of this hole or the bottom

31
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.080
of this cliff?

32
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.840
Negative 85 meters.

33
00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.520
OK, so I'm just going to take this away.

34
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.750
Now, what is the benefit of this in a lot of cases when you're given the initial hype?

35
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.310
I would actually just prefer to look at it in this perspective rather than this perspective over here.

36
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.780
Same here.

37
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.430
Actually dropping an object out of a window or you are on top of a building.

38
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.680
You know, the height of the the window that you're dropping the object out of or the height of the

39
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.590
building that you're dropping something off of.

40
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.700
And when you're given that, I would actually just look at perspective one over here, I suppose, perspective,

41
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.740
too, because I don't like the idea that you might forget this negative sign here.

42
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.750
And I'll actually put you into a lot of trouble.

43
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.620
I don't like that.

44
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.320
OK, well, how about this, say, if we weren't given.

45
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.120
The initial high.

46
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.320
And this is what we're trying to find.

47
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.960
OK, well, that's fine for this situation because we actually do have the idea that it's going to be

48
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.930
hitting the ground and we actually do have a given piece of information that it's zero meters but say

49
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.360
if safe over here and want once again, let's say this.

50
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.120
Let's say that the object.

51
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.970
Is up here.

52
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.500
And we're trying to find the final right now.

53
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.150
Well, we don't have the initial height, we don't have the initial height and we don't have the final

54
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.040
height, so this is no good.

55
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.540
Whereas if we do look at it like this in this perspective and we're trying to find out the final height,

56
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:40.410
maybe after it drops for a certain amount of seconds, at least when we're looking at it like this,

57
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:47.640
where we don't have the height, we at least have a given piece of information that the initial height

58
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.690
will be zero.

59
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.060
In this situation, hey, what if you're actually saying, hey, this building is a certain not a meters

60
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.940
off the ground, I don't know what that number is.

61
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.890
Well, so this is a known piece of information and this is an unknown piece of information.

62
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.180
And if we actually aren't given a another piece of information on the problem, we won't be able to

63
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.620
solve it.

64
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.450
But with this perspective in mind, if you're not given height, you can at least say that the initial

65
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.120
height of the object is zero and it's going to drop down a certain amount in a lot of situations.

66
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.030
You will calculate this out and you will get a negative height for how much it actually does drop.

67
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.620
So those are the two different perspectives whenever you're actually given a certain height.

68
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:40.270
I would actually just say, hey, I want this initial height is 85 meters if you're not giving in height.

69
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.370
I would actually just say that zero meters and it's just going to drop down a certain amount.

70
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.710
So given a certain height, say it's that's the initial height.

71
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.220
If you're not having an initial height, say that the initial height is zero.
