00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.650
What is this nine point eight meters per second squared really mean?

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.620
Well, acceleration is a change in velocity over a certain amount of time.

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:20.630
So for every one second, the velocity increases by or changes by nine point eight meters per second,

4
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.230
it's a change in velocity over a certain amount of time.

5
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.200
So based on this information, for every one second, the velocity increases by nine point eight meters

6
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.760
per second.

7
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.620
What velocity does our book hit the floor?

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.770
OK, so let's talk about this here.

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.100
Let's do a approximation.

10
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.580
Let's do a little estimation here.

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:50.160
So at zero seconds, when we drop the book, how fast is the book going at zero seconds.

12
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.430
Well, we're just letting go of the book.

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.480
We're not throwing the book down.

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.520
We're not throwing the book up.

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.110
So the initial velocity at zero seconds is going to be zero meters per second.

16
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.720
OK, so based on our definition, for every one second, the velocity increases by nine point eight

17
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.230
meters per second after one second, what's the book's velocity?

18
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.570
Oh, it's nine point eight meters per second.

19
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.220
OK, well, after two seconds, once again, for every second, the velocity increases by or changes

20
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.110
by nine point eight meters per second.

21
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.980
So after two seconds, what is the velocity of the book?

22
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.360
Nineteen point six meters per second.

23
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.320
And so what do I do there?

24
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.900
Well, we have nine point eight plus another nine point eight or nine point eight times to well, give

25
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.400
us to nineteen point six.

26
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.430
And that's the velocity.

27
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.030
What about after three seconds?

28
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.220
Well, nine point eight plus another nine point eight plus another nine point eight or simply nine point

29
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.570
eight times three gets us to twenty nine point four meters per second.

30
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.560
So in our previous problem.

31
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.170
Well, I want to do here is OK, so once again, we're going to be looking at at what velocity does

32
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.790
our book hit the floor?

33
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.940
OK, so we're going to be using the time that we should have gone, not the time that we calculated.

34
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.400
So let's actually just look at use point five, five seconds.

35
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.030
OK, so just come back over here.

36
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.570
I'm going to do some erasing.

37
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.270
We're not going to be using this anymore.

38
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.400
The time that we're going to be using is our point five five, the time that we should have gotten in

39
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.200
our experiment.

40
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:43.250
So zero point five, five seconds if we're doing an approximation over here, point five, five seconds

41
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.050
is between which two of these time frames that were here.

42
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.340
So we have zero seconds.

43
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.520
One second, two seconds.

44
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.060
Three seconds.

45
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.750
Hey, nought point five five is going to be between zero and one.

46
00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.360
So I'm thinking if I'm to just estimate this, I'm thinking that the velocity at which the book hits

47
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.030
the floor will be between nine meters per second and zero.

48
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.770
Let's just do a little estimate here.

49
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.650
If it's impactive, that's roughly half just going to do this.

50
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.360
My head right now, let's actually just say, hey, Noah, I'm thinking roughly five meters per second

51
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.870
is a good rough, I guess, over here.

52
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.910
So let's actually just calculate this out now.

53
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.720
So we're interested in our final velocity.

54
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.250
Hey, look at this.

55
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.100
We have so much given information over here.

56
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.020
We don't need to do our kids solutions.

57
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.410
All we have to do is come over here and say, hey, any one of these formulas that has to do with final

58
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.040
velocity.

59
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.490
I could use that because I have so much given information over here.

60
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.200
We could use any one of these formulas.

61
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.140
Now, once again, it has to do with final velocity.

62
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.380
We're not going to use this one now because that has to do with average.

63
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.530
So we're, for the most part, just going to be using these formulas down here.

64
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.720
So look at this.

65
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.040
Final velocity is by itself already on the left hand side the equation.

66
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.680
I think it would be very easy to just use this formula because once again, it's already on the left

67
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.240
hand side the equation just like this one.

68
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.470
But we actually do have this squared over here, so I don't want to be dealing with that.

69
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.630
Let's keep things simple and keep in mind, A, we have all of these variables.

70
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.390
We have the final shape, we have the initial height.

71
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.510
We have all these other variables that we could really use any one of these except for this one right

72
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.720
here, which doesn't have final velocity.

73
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.710
And so equation number five is really the only equation that we can't be using Haixun.

74
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.110
What if we were to use equation number four?

75
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.520
We have final velocity in here.

76
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.040
It's going to just take a little bit more work at the very end when we're having to solve for final

77
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.580
velocity.

78
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.050
I don't want to do that.

79
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.960
I just want to use this one, which is this one right here.

80
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.700
It's already solved that for final velocity.

81
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.100
So that's the equation that I'm going to choose to use.

82
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:07.340
The F is equal to V I plus our acceleration times Delta T, let's do our substitutions here.

83
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:19.250
Initial velocity of zero plus are negative nine point eight times R Delta T, which is zero point five

84
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.780
five oh.

85
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.390
We have to do this in the calculator and we get our answer.

86
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:33.600
This zero provides no value, so we have a plus negative nine point eight times point five five three

87
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.030
negative five point three nine meters per second.

88
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.160
Hey, our guest was a pretty spot on.

89
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.800
Well, not exactly, but pretty close.

90
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.280
Hey, wait a minute.

91
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.220
Once again, why is it negative?

92
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.610
Well.

93
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.930
What is the negative represent the direction, which direction, this object?

94
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.580
Well, it's falling down to the ground, so the negative here represents direction.

95
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:07.670
So we were able to calculate the velocity at which the the object hits the floor.

96
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.010
So once again, this is the velocity that the object that the book, the box, whatever, that KISS's

97
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.260
hits the floor at this velocity.

98
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.550
One thing I do want to actually have to keep in mind is this.

99
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.380
Let's come back to our kinematic equations.

100
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.960
Like I said, you could have used equations three, four or six.

101
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.410
Keep in mind this, when you plug in all of your values over here, the very last step that you're going

102
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.110
to have to do is we don't care about the F squared.

103
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.450
We would have to take the square root of both sides of the equation.

104
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.120
And whenever you take the square root of a number in your calculator, you will get a positive answer.

105
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.070
We want to make sure that we do include the negative side to represent our direction.

106
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.760
Don't try not to actually fall for things like that.

107
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.540
If you if you do say, hey, what?

108
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:10.050
The final velocity is five point three nine meters per second and in the downwards direction, maybe

109
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.540
your professor or teacher will accept that kind of answer, but really just make sure that you include

110
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.320
the negative sign.

111
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:23.520
It would actually be more accurate if we were to say these values are negative because once again,

112
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:31.260
velocity is a vector and vectors have both of magnitude of value as well as direction.

113
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.620
So it would actually be more accurate for us to include these negatives here, including over here as

114
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.750
well as this, because not only is velocity a vector, but also acceleration is as well.

115
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.860
So once again, these negatives are just representing the direction.
