1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,480
So let's get into problem number for a student drops a ball from a window three point five meters above

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,180
the sidewalk, how fast and how fast is it moving when it hits the sidewalk?

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,670
OK, you could you could feel free to pause this video, try this problem on your own.

4
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,580
Don't worry if you feel like, hey, and what we're down to the last problem, this is all the practice

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,730
you're give me now.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,510
I have more practice problems for you.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,660
So don't think that you're being cheated out on any sort of practice.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,180
I will have that for yourself.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,090
All right.

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,650
So post this video, try it on your own, unpause the video and let's do it together, OK?

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,260
So once again, that student is dropping a ball from a window three point five meters high.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,010
How fast is it moving?

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,910
OK, so where the ball?

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,620
When it hits the sidewalk.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,650
OK, so our indicator that it's actually going to be hitting the ground, good.

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,830
OK, so what's our initial height of the object?

17
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,430
What's the final flight?

18
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,740
What's this right this in?

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,420
What's our initial velocity?

20
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,080
Are we throwing the ball up or we throw it down or are we just letting go?

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,870
Are we trying to find out how fast is the ball moving when it hits the sidewalk?

22
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,810
OK, so this is what we're going to be looking for and what is our acceleration due to gravity?

23
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,060
And does it say anything about time?

24
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,140
Nope, and it's not I mean, asking about time.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,090
So this is going to be the variable that we don't care about.

26
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,820
So when we come over here, we're going to be looking for our Delta T. and saying, hey, look, I don't

27
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:08,510
care about you coming over here.

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,850
There it is right there.

29
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,190
I don't care about you.

30
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,810
What's your skin?

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,070
We got Delta T. right there.

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,200
And we have Delta T over here as well.

33
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,460
So we don't care about you.

34
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,790
And we don't have Delta team this formula, so we could actually be using this to find our final velocity

35
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,600
and which is nice is once again final velocity is on the left hand side of the equation by itself already.

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,080
So that's going to be super simple for us to calculate the S1.

37
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,410
OK, once again, make sure that you wrote down the formula correct, and I think that we got that looking

38
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:49,740
good.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,760
OK, so let's plug in right now.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,320
OK, this isn't going to do anything for us, this isn't going to be F squared is equal to.

41
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:25,040
So we have a positive two times and negative nine point eight times, a negative three point five.

42
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,670
So we have these two negatives.

43
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,780
They're being multiplied to each other.

44
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,900
So we're going to expect a positive value right now, OK?

45
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,150
And that's what the F squared is equal to.

46
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,710
We don't care what the F squared is equal to.

47
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,130
We want.

48
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,160
So how do we get rid of the square?

49
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,780
Do we take the square root of both sides of the equation?

50
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,280
Yeah.

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,700
Eight point two eight.

52
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,730
I'm just going to say eight point to eight.

53
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,100
Meters per second.

54
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,760
Oh, wait a minute, though, what is the object doing?

55
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,880
It's falling.

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,600
Downwards, right, so let's indicate that with a negative sign right there, and that is our final

57
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,190
answer.
