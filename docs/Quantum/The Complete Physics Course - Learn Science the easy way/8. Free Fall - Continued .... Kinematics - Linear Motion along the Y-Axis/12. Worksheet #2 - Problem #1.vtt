00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.360
So the first problem over here, it says a tennis ball is thrown straight up with initial speed or initial

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.070
velocity of twenty two point five meters per second.

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.030
It is the same distance above the ground.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.240
How high does the ball rise?

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.180
How long this ball in the air and just a little hint, the time it takes the ball to rise is equal to

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.980
the time it takes to fall.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.650
OK, and we already know that.

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.440
So I guess I could just remove that hand.

9
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.150
OK, so what is the given information that we have here?

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.810
So first of all, let's talk about what's happening here.

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
A tennis ball is being thrown straight up in the air with this amount of speed and it's quite the same

12
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.360
distance.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.270
OK, so right off the bat.

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.120
What is the initial height of the ball?

15
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.570
Zero, right?

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.100
And what is the final flight of the ball?

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.150
Zero meters, right?

18
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.590
Initial velocity is twenty two point five meters per second.

19
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.090
How hard is the ball rise?

20
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.110
OK, wait a minute.

21
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.760
So we're trying to find out how high rises this is, trying to get a little confusing here.

22
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.980
This is the initial position and this is the final position.

23
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.410
You know what?

24
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.300
Let's take a little break here.

25
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.760
Let's I just want to show you a little something.

26
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.520
I'm just going to erase this information.

27
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.920
OK, well, safe, I wasn't given the initial velocity.

28
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.530
OK, so if I wasn't given initial velocity in this problem and what so we know that the initial velocity

29
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.180
is equal to the final velocity, right.

30
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.320
But if I wasn't given the initial velocity, then I also wouldn't be given the final velocity.

31
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.170
And those would be two unknowns right off the bat.

32
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.650
And that's going to make our problem very complicated.

33
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.690
I don't like that.

34
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.210
That's that's going to be a nuisance for us.

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.560
Right.

36
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.490
But we do know that this trajectory is very symmetric.

37
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.900
Right.

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.340
Here's what I'm going to do.

39
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.510
I'm going to drop a dotted line.

40
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.800
Down here like this.

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.110
And let's say this, let's say that the initial position.

42
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.890
It's over here.

43
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.830
So this is our initial height right here, and let's say that the final height.

44
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.200
Is up here.

45
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.260
Hey, you know what?

46
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.190
OK, so if we're to do that, what is the what is the benefit of saying that this is the initial position,

47
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.710
that initial height and this is the final height?

48
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.030
Well, what's nice here is that we know that the velocity here at this at this point in the highest

49
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.020
level is why.

50
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.050
Zero meters per second.

51
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.330
So right off the bat, if we set it up like this, say, if we just ignore all of this and we just say,

52
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.830
hey, know what, this is going to be the national position in this is going to be the final position.

53
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.960
What do we know right away?

54
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.800
Hey, and what this is going to be the final velocity at this point, which is at the highest point,

55
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.910
are at the highest point of its trajectory.

56
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.990
So that's nice.

57
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.040
I like that a lot.

58
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.720
That idea that we know a piece of given information or right off the bat.

59
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.700
So let's do that.

60
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.800
Let's once again, we're just going to ignore it for now.

61
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.540
And we do know that the object is going to fall back to the ground and hit the ground.

62
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.070
So we'll keep that in mind.

63
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:55.380
So we do know that the initial speed, the initial velocity is twenty two point five meters per second,

64
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.250
if we're defining that this is the top of the trajectory, then the final velocity will be zero meters

65
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.840
per second.

66
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.920
We're defining that another piece of information that we have is what is our acceleration?

67
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.420
What's the acceleration due to gravity?

68
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.720
Right.

69
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.480
We have the force of gravity acting on this object throughout the entire trajectory.

70
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.870
So what's the acceleration?

71
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.730
And we also we have oh, what's the initial height of this object?

72
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.330
Look at all this information that we're pulling out.

73
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:32.590
How hard is the.

74
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.560
OK, so it looks like that this is what we're trying to find here.

75
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.260
How long does the ball remain in the air?

76
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.250
OK, so.

77
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:53.760
The reason why we actually just did that last, that task where we had the tea rise and the tea fall

78
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.550
I'm sorry, tea total and tea for was simply because of this right now.

79
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.570
OK, so we are defining that this is the initial position or defining that this is the final position,

80
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.110
if that's the case, if we solve for time, understand the idea that you're solving for the time from

81
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.100
here to here.

82
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.780
Let's say that this is equal to let's call it three seconds.

83
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.980
If this is three seconds from here to here, what is the total time?

84
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.290
It's asking us how long does a ball remain in the air from here to here?

85
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.150
It's three seconds.

86
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.890
The balls in the air for a total of six seconds, the total time.

87
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.180
So that's the reason why we're doing this.

88
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.050
All right.

89
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.280
So we're trying to find out.

90
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:53.290
This, but when we calculate this, what we'll find is that because we're saying that the initial position

91
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.200
is here and the final position is here, if that doesn't make sense, rewind this video and play it

92
00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.530
again.

93
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.900
OK, so let's do this.

94
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.520
Let's do our calculations right now, being that we talked a lot about the time and everything.

95
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.900
Let's calculate that first.

96
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.490
So if we're trying to find out what the time is, what's the variable that we simply don't care about?

97
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.990
Our final hyp.

98
00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.610
OK, so coming over here, what is the kinematic equation that we're going to be using, we don't care

99
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.660
about the final height, right?

100
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.480
So do we have final say over here, Wyeth?

101
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.050
No.

102
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.640
Do we have Wyeth over here?

103
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.150
Yep.

104
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.690
Right there.

105
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.170
Right there.

106
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.850
Do we have Wyeth in this equation?

107
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.300
Oh, yes.

108
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.250
Yep, right there.

109
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.040
And do we have wife in this equation?

110
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.710
OK, so that's right there.

111
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.170
And so process of elimination once again helps us out, finding out which which equation to use to find

112
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.080
our identity.

113
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.450
So that equation once again was Veth.

114
00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:02.870
OK, so now all we have to do is plug in our given information cell from there so the earth is equal

115
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.320
to zero.

116
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:10.210
Once again, this being the final position that from the height of the ball, maximum height zero.

117
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:19.130
And initially we are traveling and while the object is traveling at the speed date of nine point eighty

118
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.310
and the Delta T is what we're interested in.

119
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:24.370
OK.

120
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:33.320
OK, so we have here twenty two point five plus a negative nine point eight times Delta T, we have

121
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.270
two terms here.

122
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.430
Terms are once again separated by positive signs and negative signs.

123
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.680
What we want to do here is isolate the Delta T so this term over here, we're going to leave this alone

124
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.250
for now.

125
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:46.120
Let's get rid of our positive twenty two point five.

126
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.300
How do you go about doing that?

127
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.000
But subtract twenty two point five by both sides of the equation and we're left with our negative nine

128
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.460
point eight times Delta T.

129
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.780
OK, so once again, we're going to be isolating our Delta T so we have a multiplication of negative

130
00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.370
nine point eight, how to get rid of a multiplication of negative negative nine point eight divided

131
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.740
by negative nine point eight on both sides of the equation.

132
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.440
I'm going to do this in the calculator right now and see what we get.

133
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.070
Keep in mind that once again, we have twenty two point five I'm sorry, negative, twenty two point

134
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.290
five divided by a negative nine point eight.

135
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:23.520
So what are we expecting?

136
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.330
A positive answer?

137
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.200
A negative answer?

138
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:32.250
Keep that in mind and we get our answer of two point three seconds.

139
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:41.740
As equal to our Delta T. But once again, we did that for.

140
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.610
This is our initial position, that's our final position, the way that we know that this is definitely

141
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:52.000
our final position is because we're saying that the final velocity here at this point is equal to zero.

142
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.270
We toss the ball straight up.

143
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.000
It's to go up, up, up, up, up, pause.

144
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.930
And we're defining that to be our final position, our final position.

145
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.990
And we know that because our final velocity is zero.

146
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.040
So the time that we got is two point three seconds.

147
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.200
That's this time right here.

148
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.330
What we're really interested in is the total time.

149
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.880
So what is the value of the total time?

150
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.060
If the time to rise is two point three seconds, do this in your head.

151
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.170
Four point six seconds, right?

152
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.990
All right, and that's the first problem.

153
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:28.750
OK, so.

154
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:36.410
Now that we got that, we're going to carve out for our Wyeth, what is the.

155
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.420
It's asking us how high does ball rise, that's the why, if this is the initial position, that's the

156
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.080
final position.

157
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.130
The final position will tell us how high the ball rises.

158
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.280
So let's find out our why and what do we do.

159
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.990
We say to ourselves, I don't care what Delta team is equal to.

160
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.350
I'm just going to come right back over here.

161
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.000
Let's clean this up a little bit.

162
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:58.380
Give me a quick second over here.

163
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.700
Please be patient.

164
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.790
There we go.

165
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:11.720
So we we are going to be saying that we don't care about our Delta T because we're searching for our

166
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.560
Y path, OK?

167
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.270
So let's look for our Delta teams coming through here.

168
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.790
We got Delta T. right there.

169
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.560
I'm just going to stay consistent.

170
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.340
Let's go with our read, OK?

171
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.740
Coming through here, we got Delta T. right there.

172
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.760
You that one Delta T twice in this formula.

173
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.670
So we're obviously not going to be using that one.

174
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.300
And we will be using this one over here because it doesn't have the Delta T..

175
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.940
Let's write out that formula.

176
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.470
Make sure that you write this out.

177
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.930
Correct.

178
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.520
Okay, and that looks good, right?

179
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:59.310
Uh, so here we go, what's the are plugging this in and solving out for once again our why on earth.

180
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.380
So we have squared.

181
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.010
Zero squared.

182
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.530
Twenty two point five squared.

183
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.150
OK, so we know right off the bat the subtraction of zero is not going can actually do anything for

184
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.950
us neither.

185
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800
So we have zero squared over here.

186
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.680
We can't really cross this out being that it's the only thing that's on the left hand side the equation.

187
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.140
We can't cross that out.

188
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:32.610
We're just gonna drop down our zero.

189
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:34.600
That's a nice little placeholder for us.

190
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.170
All right.

191
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.190
So let's simplify this.

192
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.080
What's twenty two point five square?

193
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.680
Twenty point five times, twenty two point five.

194
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:47.190
We got five oh six point twenty five plus.

195
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:52.480
OK, well, oh, we have positive two times and negative nine point eight.

196
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.280
Will that result in a positive or negative number that's going to result in a negative number that's

197
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:04.600
going to result in negative nineteen point six and that's being multiplied by y ath.

198
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.030
Once again, we have two terms over here.

199
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.890
Terms once again are being separated by plus signs and minus signs.

200
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.040
We have a five or six point twenty five minus nineteen point six times are Wyeth.

201
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.910
We're trying to isolate our Wyeth, so let's get rid of our positive five or six point twenty five by

202
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.180
subtracting five or six point twenty five on both sides of the equation.

203
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:43.020
OK, so we have a multiplication of negative nineteen point six, so we have to divide by negative nineteen

204
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.170
point six on both sides, question will have a negative divide by negative.

205
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.630
So therefore we'll get a positive answer.

206
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:58.290
And that will be so we have that divide that by nineteen point six were negative, nineteen point six

207
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.650
and we have twenty five point let's call it a.

208
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.550
Mehta's.

209
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.240
Know what, this should be a state right here if you're running correctly.

210
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.480
OK, so there you go.

211
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:24.770
Once again, the key thing to remember here is this I just make sure that you understand the concept

212
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:30.890
of this is our initial position, this is our final position, and that's the way I'm going to be treating

213
00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.820
all these problems.

214
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:38.600
We're just going to have to consider when we solve out for our Delta T, are we solving out for the

215
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.520
T rise or teetotal?

216
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:47.720
If we want our answer to be the total and we calculate out that he rise, then what we have to do is

217
00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.850
multiply that by two to get our total.
