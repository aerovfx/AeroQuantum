1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,040
So from number one, keep in mind that these are all going to be problems where the object is being

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:05,700
dropped.

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,630
Notice how I said that they're being dropped, they're not being thrown upwards, not they're not being

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:10,620
thrown downwards.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,580
And we'll actually see that these these problems over here.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,320
So problem number one, your sister drops your house keys down to you from the second floor window if

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,210
you catch them four point three meters from where your sister dropped them.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,080
What is the velocity of the case when you catch them?

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,370
OK, so it's describing here that your sister is dropping keys out of a window and they're dropping

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,160
for a total of four point three meters.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,090
And you're being asked what is the velocity when you catch them?

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,670
Well, I'm just going to do here is I'm just gonna draw a picture.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,050
Does it really matter that they're being dropped out of a window?

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,020
Does it really matter that they're being caught and not actually hitting the ground?

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,020
No, we just know that they're dropping for a total of four point three meters.

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,950
So essentially, what do we have here?

17
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,970
We have an object.

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,700
It's going to be dropping for a total of four point three meters.

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,460
I know that was shown here that's hitting the ground, but it doesn't matter if they're being caught

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,920
or if they're hitting the ground.

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,090
We know that they're dropping for a total of four point three meters and that's what matters.

22
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,450
OK, so this being the case.

23
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,490
Just think about the situation, your sister, what is she doing?

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,460
She's dropping keys and they're dropping for a total of four point three meters.

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,880
We're trying to find out the velocity of the keys.

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,980
When you catch them, they're going to hit your hand or hit the ground at a certain velocity.

27
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,340
That's the velocity that we're trying to calculate here.

28
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,570
So let's pull out some given information.

29
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,200
What would you say is the initial height of the object?

30
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,370
Well, we're given that that's given information here.

31
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,480
It's four point three.

32
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,060
And what would you say is the final height of the object?

33
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:04,470
Well, it's being called it's hitting the ground, so it's dropping for a total of four point three

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,300
metres, we could say that the final height is zero.

35
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,680
Let's come over here.

36
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,280
Let's just start writing this in.

37
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,090
What is the initial velocity, am I throwing this case up and my throwing them down, or am I just letting

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,620
go in them and letting them drop?

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,800
Initial velocity is zero meters per second.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,160
What's the final velocity?

41
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,690
Oh, isn't that what we're trying to find?

42
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,190
What is the acceleration of the object once again, four objects are in freefall.

43
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,390
It's going to be a negative nine point eight meters per second squared.

44
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,990
That's acceleration due to gravity.

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,740
And are we given anything about time?

46
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,450
Are we being told anything about time?

47
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,140
No.

48
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,470
Right.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,880
Oh, so we're going to treat this just like we actually treat the previous problems.

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,380
So we're going to say, what do I not care about time?

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,070
I'm just going to come back over here and let's look through this.

52
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,770
I'm going to tell you right off the bat, I don't think that I actually have any problems for Free-Fall

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,050
that actually have to do with average velocity.

54
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,960
So I'm just going to erase these two equations right here.

55
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,240
It's going to be these four equations that were going to be mainly dealing with now what's in what I

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,850
say, the variable that we simply just don't care about is going to be our time.

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,210
Let's come through here.

58
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,420
Let's find all the equations I have to do with time and exclude them.

59
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,620
So we have time right here.

60
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,190
OK, that's an equation that we're not interested in coming over here.

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,470
Oh, we have time right there.

62
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,480
OK, so I'm not interested in this one.

63
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,040
What about this one?

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,070
We have time here and we have time there.

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,350
So definitely not going to be using this one.

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,790
And do we have time in this equation?

67
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,090
Nope.

68
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,960
OK, so we're going to be using the equation number six.

69
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,270
Make sure that you write it out correctly.

70
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,140
And did I do that correct?

71
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,200
Let's just double check here.

72
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,280
And that was good.

73
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:12,880
OK, so now let's plug in our information so we have V F squared is equal to V.I. squared, which is

74
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,090
zero squared, 020 is zero zero zero.

75
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,670
So that's not going to have any sort of impact two times our negative nine point eight.

76
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:30,740
And we have our final height, which is zero minus our initial height, which is four point three.

77
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,130
OK, so this is zero squared, zero two zero zero zero.

78
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,530
So that's not going to have any sort of impact on our equation.

79
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,360
We have this zero over here and zero minus four point three.

80
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,150
Or we could actually just call this a minus four point three and negative four point three.

81
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,000
They're the same thing.

82
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,960
It doesn't really matter.

83
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:54,380
So let's just get rid of this zero over here and notice here that what we have is two times well, it's

84
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,150
a positive two times, nine point eight times a negative four point three.

85
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,770
So we have a positive times, a negative times, a negative.

86
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,190
This should result in a positive answer in the calculator right now.

87
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,290
And we get eighty four point two eight.

88
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,510
That's equal to the F squared.

89
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,400
I don't care what V of squared is equal to.

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,720
I want to know what our final velocity is equal to.

91
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,470
So how do we get rid of the squared, take the square root of both sides of the equation and we get

92
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,260
the F is equal to nine point two metres per second.

93
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,230
Hey, wait a minute.

94
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,650
The answer over here is telling us it's negative nine point two meters per second.

95
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,810
The calculator, when you take the square root of this, it will not give you a negative answer.

96
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,630
It's going to give you the positive version.

97
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,380
So make sure that you do include the negative to account for the direction.
