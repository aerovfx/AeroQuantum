00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.550
Let's get into problem number two, says a student trying out for the football team kicks the football

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.500
straight up in the air.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.270
The ball hits him on the way back down.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.240
It took three seconds from the time when the student punted the ball until he gets hit by the ball.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.410
A what is the football's initial velocity?

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.100
B, how high did the football travel?

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.090
OK, so how are we going to purchase now?

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.740
All right.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.980
So just understand it's own come up and come back down over here like this.

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.370
Right.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.680
OK, so I have a question for you.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.170
It says it takes three seconds.

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.900
What does this 30 seconds represent?

14
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.720
OK, so it says it took three seconds from the time when the student punted the ball until he gets hit

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.350
by the ball.

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.790
--, and he gets hit.

17
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.040
OK, so this three seconds represents what that's the total time, right?

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.700
So t total.

19
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.920
Is equal to the three seconds.

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.730
OK, well, so if we are using this position here as our initial position and this over here as our

21
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.410
final position and we're considering the trajectory of the ball from here to here.

22
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.260
So this is our initial and this is our final HAINA.

23
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.620
What?

24
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.800
When we're using the given information over here, are we going to be using the total, the time toll,

25
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.930
or do we care about the time the ball travels from here to here?

26
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.700
Yeah, not so.

27
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.230
We're going to be using this time.

28
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.360
So that's the time to rise.

29
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.850
Which is.

30
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.200
The one point five seconds.

31
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.080
Because we have a lot of great given information over here.

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.670
We know that the velocity here at this point is equal to zero meters per second.

33
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.600
We know.

34
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.140
At this point, what's the initial height of the ball that's going to be at zero meters, so we have

35
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.090
VEF over here, what's acceleration of the ball and what isn't ball going to be affected due to gravity?

36
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.570
So we have acceleration due to gravity acting on the ball.

37
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.060
OK, so and what are the two questions?

38
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.900
It says what is the initial velocity of the football?

39
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.560
So we're trying to find out the eye as well as how high.

40
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.530
OK, so the final height over here and the.

41
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.640
So if we're using this initial position and this as our final position, then the time that we're interested

42
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.220
in is the one point five seconds.

43
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.060
So that's what we're going to be using as our identity.

44
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.300
OK, so we have our problem set up and all we have to do is plug this into the equations and we could

45
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.080
get our answers.

46
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.610
All right.

47
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.030
So I know that the first question is asking for the initial velocity, but let's find out how high the

48
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.260
football traveled.

49
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.350
OK, so if we're trying to find out how high traveled, what we're going to do is we're going to say

50
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.670
that the initial velocity, the V is the variable that we don't care about.

51
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.660
So when we come over here once again, we're going to be looking for the final the final height.

52
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.930
Right.

53
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.080
So what we want to do is cancel out all the equations that have to do with initial velocity.

54
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.290
So over here gambiae, looking for initial velocity.

55
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.090
We have the initial velocity right there, so we can't use this formula.

56
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.040
OK, this one, we have initial velocity right there.

57
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.150
Can you see that one?

58
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.630
Hmm, we have initial velocity right here.

59
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.160
OK.

60
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.940
Oh, wait a minute, we have initial velocity right here as well, so we can't do that.

61
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.980
Wait a minute.

62
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.930
OK, so maybe that's the reason why it's telling us first to find the initial velocity, the ball,

63
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.790
it's because all of these equations over here have to do with initial velocity.

64
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.450
So therefore, we can't find out our final height before before finding our initial velocity.

65
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.110
So we are going to have to find this one out first.

66
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:30.220
OK, so come back over here, let's undo all of this, all these all these equations have initial velocity

67
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.090
in them, so.

68
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.930
We have to find our initial velocity first and then we'll need it to figure out the final position of

69
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.350
the ball, the height of the ball.

70
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.640
So let's find out what our initial velocity is.

71
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.370
We're going to say that we don't care about are the height of the ball.

72
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.570
So let's come over here.

73
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.770
Where do we see the height of the ball?

74
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.090
The Y right there.

75
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.450
We got the Wyeth right here.

76
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.530
We have Wyeth.

77
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.110
And over here, we have Wyeth.

78
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.230
All right, so this is the only equation that doesn't have Wyeth in it.

79
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:16.990
So let's use this to find the initial velocity v F is equal to a V.I. plus R acceleration times R Delta

80
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.620
T..

81
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.470
Once again, we're going to make sure that we wrote this down.

82
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.130
Correct.

83
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.410
And now it's pretty good, right?

84
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.340
OK, so let's plug in our given information now.

85
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.980
So we have our Veth, which is zero.

86
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.560
That's at the maximum height.

87
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.390
And then our V.I. is what we're trying to find, plus our acceleration, which is our negative nine

88
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.500
point eight times our Delta T, which is our one point five.

89
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.850
OK, so let's toss this in the calculator.

90
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.150
We're just going to simplify the negative nine point eight times the positive one point five.

91
00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.980
What will we get here, positive or negative?

92
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.430
Hopefully, hopefully you're saying to yourself, won't get a negative number.

93
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.140
So plug in that calculator.

94
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.570
We get negative fourteen point seven.

95
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.130
So something out for our V.I. We have a negative fourteen point seven.

96
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.410
How do we get rid of the negative fourteen point seven at fourteen point seven to both sides of the

97
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.040
equation and we will get fourteen point seven metres per second as our initial velocity.

98
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.590
OK, so once again.

99
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:36.310
We do know that we're going to need this value to calculate our final height over here, so.

100
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:45.120
Is there any variable that we don't care about, well, we have this we have everything else.

101
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.980
The only thing that we don't have is our final height.

102
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.980
So what we can do is this.

103
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.740
We could basically use any of this that has to do with final height.

104
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.990
The only equation that doesn't have to do with final height is this one right here.

105
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.610
So we can't use the third equation, but we could use every single one of these other equations because

106
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.050
it has the final height in it.

107
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.150
And we have all the other variables that are associated with these formulas, so I'll tell you this.

108
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:23.090
I'm going to use either for my four or five, because why is already salts for on the left hand side

109
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.600
the equation?

110
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.820
I'm not going to use this one because I don't want to have to suffer.

111
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.130
Why?

112
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.100
If you could choose any one of these formulas and you should get the same answer.

113
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:40.070
But I'm going to use let's go with formula number four, OK?

114
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.500
OK, so I'm just going to write out Formula number four and here we go.

115
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.960
We have why F is equal to Delta T, let's double checked.

116
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.370
Make sure that I wrote that out.

117
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.150
Correct.

118
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.950
And it looks pretty good, right?

119
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.750
All right, and let's just plug in.

120
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.860
And our.

121
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.420
Initial velocity is going to be R 14.

122
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:15.230
Point seven, I don't like having to do this because we're having to use a value which we calculated,

123
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.130
but in a situation like this, we're kind of forced here.

124
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.820
So let's just roll with it.

125
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.420
And all we have to do is plug everything in the calculator.

126
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.870
Obviously, we don't need to plug this end or this over here.

127
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:39.640
We just have the point five times the fourteen point seven times one point five, and we should get

128
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.690
the answer.

129
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.930
Eleven point zero twenty five.

130
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.050
Meters, and that's how high it goes.

131
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.800
OK, so those are our two answers now.

132
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.380
That does it.
