1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:07.260
So we were dealing with objects where we're just going to take an object and it's going to fall, come

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.690
down to the ground and hit the ground or just a free falling object.

3
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.550
Now, what we're going to do is this.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.850
We're going to take an object and toss it up in the air.

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:26.260
Like this, and this can go up, up, up, up, up in the air and then come down, down, down, down,

6
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.960
down, down, down.

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.600
And so this this is where we're actually giving the object an initial velocity.

8
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.830
So let's actually just say that we're tossing the ball up in the air.

9
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.210
And so describing this, how does the object move?

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.140
Does it go up and then get faster and faster and faster and faster as it's going up now?

11
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.030
Well, wait a minute.

12
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.410
That would actually describe like a rocket ship, right?

13
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.220
So when you toss a ball or an object of an air, what happens?

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.670
It goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up, pause.

15
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.530
And then down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

16
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.190
Right.

17
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.590
So it actually goes starts off really fast and then starts to slow down.

18
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.510
Slow down for a brief moment.

19
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.580
It pauses and then it starts to drop.

20
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.380
Dropped up, dropped faster, faster than bam.

21
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.950
It hits the ground.

22
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.520
Right.

23
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.330
So that's actually describe the object object's trajectory.

24
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.110
I know that you use this term before the object objects trajectory is what we're describing right here,

25
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.910
which is the path of the motion.

26
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.710
OK, so say if we actually have a now, I just want to also describe this hand.

27
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.910
What?

28
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.350
We're just throwing the ball straight up and it's coming straight down.

29
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.330
I can't really depict that in this illustration.

30
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.310
So that's the reason why I'm actually having it go up into the right and then down into the right.

31
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.110
It's not a exact and perfect depiction that I actually have right here, but it's kind of the best I

32
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.060
could work with considering the idea that I wouldn't be able to show this go straight up and straight

33
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.440
down as nicely.

34
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.380
So anyway, we just said before, we're going to be throwing the object up in the air, right?

35
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.070
So we have to give the object an initial velocity.

36
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:16.270
So let's just say that initial velocity is twenty nine point four meters per second and this is at time

37
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.780
of zero.

38
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.370
So let's just do this.

39
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.990
Let's say that we have our.

40
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.560
Velocity our time in seconds and let's right our direction.

41
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.490
OK, so at time of zero seconds, what's the initial velocity?

42
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.290
Oh, it's twenty nine point four meters per second.

43
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.330
And what's the direction?

44
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.080
Well, we're tossing it upwards.

45
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.410
Right.

46
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.310
OK, so we know that acceleration due to gravity.

47
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.380
Is negative nine point eight meters per second squared, and once again, what this means is for every

48
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.940
one second the objects velocity will change by negative nine point eight meters per second.

49
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.360
That's what acceleration is.

50
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.690
It's a change in velocity over a certain amount of time.

51
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.170
So if our initial velocity is twenty nine point four meters per second and zero seconds, then after

52
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.430
one second, what is our object's velocity?

53
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.170
So let's say here it's at one second, well, our object's velocity will be the twenty nine point four

54
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.170
minus the nine point eight meters per second, giving us nineteen point six meters per second.

55
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.960
So over here, we have nineteen point six meters per second.

56
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.060
OK, well, what about after two seconds or so object's velocity, while nineteen point six minus our

57
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060
nine point eight gives us nine point eight meters per second.

58
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.090
So we have now nine point eight meters per second.

59
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.680
Notice that our object's velocity is starting to slow down a bit.

60
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.630
OK, and the direction is still upwards.

61
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.540
What about after three seconds?

62
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.330
Well, we're going to subtract nine point eight.

63
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.420
So we have our nine point eight minus nine point.

64
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.400
What does that get us?

65
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.870
Zero meters per second and does that make sense?

66
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.770
And what when you toss an object up in the air, it goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up.

67
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.880
And then what does it do for a brief moment?

68
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.450
It pauses and then it comes down, down, down, down, down, down, down.

69
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.570
Right.

70
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.960
Isn't that the way that the objects trajectory actually goes?

71
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:47.770
So all the way at the top over here, the objects velocity is zero meters per second and that should

72
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.430
make sense.

73
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.160
So what is the object direction?

74
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.780
I know it doesn't really have a direction.

75
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.950
I'm just going to I'm not going to draw a line.

76
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.720
So we're going to keep that blank.

77
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.600
OK, well, what about after four seconds?

78
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.290
We're just be negative nine point eight because we have zero.

79
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.060
Minus nine point eight, and that gets us negative nine point eight.

80
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.400
So we are over here and we have a negative nine point eight.

81
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.760
And what is our direction?

82
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.800
Our direction is now downwards.

83
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.160
So now our direction is downwards.

84
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.230
And once again, was this negative represent?

85
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.640
That's a downward direction.

86
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.020
Right.

87
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.520
And we're just going down a little bit.

88
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.730
What about after five seconds?

89
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.990
What is our object's velocity and what it's going to be nineteen point six negative, nine point eight

90
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.340
minus another nine point.

91
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.850
It is negative nineteen point six.

92
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:54.960
And what is its direction, it's also downward, so downwards of negative nineteen point six meters

93
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.380
per second.

94
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.680
And what about for the last one, six, hey, what do you need to do this calculation?

95
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.410
Are you starting to notice a pattern?

96
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.920
Maybe you're starting to notice a pattern here that we'll actually have nineteen point six months,

97
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.050
nine point eight gives us a negative twenty nine point four meters per second.

98
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:22.420
And we have our negative twenty nine point four meters per second and the direction is once again downwards.

99
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.880
Notice check this out.

100
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.120
Look at this symmetry over here.

101
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.590
We're launching this object up at twenty nine point four meters per second.

102
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.250
What is it doing?

103
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.190
It's going up to the peak where it actually just pauses for a brief moment and then it comes down and

104
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.620
it hits the ground at the same speed, just in the opposite direction.

105
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.090
So, yeah.

106
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.280
And what we actually do have a nice symmetry over here.

107
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:56.070
All right, so I know they just spent a lot of time going over how how the trajectory is very symmetric

108
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.380
based on the velocities, but what else is very symmetric?

109
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.160
Well, what about the time?

110
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.630
How many seconds does it take to go from the ground all the way up to the maximum height?

111
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.150
One, two, three seconds.

112
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.930
And how many how much time does it take to actually go all the way down to the ground?

113
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.820
Four, five, six.

114
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.560
Another three seconds, so, hey, know what it takes for the time for the object to rise all the way

115
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:35.040
up to the max height, three seconds and for the time for it to fall?

116
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.740
Back down to the ground.

117
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:46.070
Another three seconds for a total time of six seconds, right?
