1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,720
So attached to this video is worksheet number three, print this out, download this and print it out,

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,970
and these are going to be your practice problems.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,910
So also attached to this video will be an answer key.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,710
Look at the answer key only after you're done trying some of these problems out.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,860
So the first set of problems will be when the object is being dropped and we come down over here.

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,990
You know what it looks like that there's one where the object is being thrown downwards.

7
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,350
OK, so we are giving an initial velocity.

8
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:42,070
And then there is situations where we're throwing that object upwards.

9
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,620
And there you go.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,630
So there's a there's a good chunk of problems in here for you to try out.

11
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:55,490
Like I said before, if you're stumbling on these at all whatsoever, just know that there's the answer

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,130
key for you.

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,980
So, yeah, good luck on this.

14
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,530
And yeah, I wish you the best of luck.
