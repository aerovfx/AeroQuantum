1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,350
So first question.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,170
It looks like that we have a conceptual question and it says when a ball is thrown vertically upward,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,630
it continues upward until it reaches a certain position and then it falls downward at the highest point.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,110
What is the ball's velocity?

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,400
What is its acceleration?

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,230
OK, so can we just describe it for if we take an object, a ball, toss it upwards, it goes up, up,

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,590
up, up, up, up, up and then down, down, down, down, down, down, down, right.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,750
So it goes up, pauses for a brief moment and then comes back down.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,140
Right.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,360
So what is the velocity.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,540
At the highest point.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,650
Zero meters per second.

13
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,090
And what is its acceleration?

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:49,910
Well.

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,980
For all freephone problems, including when you're throwing a ball up in the air, it's going to be

16
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,290
acted on by gravity.

17
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:05,600
So we're going to have the acceleration due to gravity acting on the object in all of its trajectory.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,480
So at all points in its trajectory, it's going to be acting.

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:16,570
The force, acting on it will be the force to gravity, so therefore will have to accelerate acceleration

20
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:25,720
due to gravity acting on the object, which is negative nine point eight meters per second squared.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,810
Well, wait a minute.

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,510
Wouldn't it be zero at this point?

23
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,150
Acceleration?

24
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,820
No, no, it won't be.

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,990
If it's got zero acceleration here, then and well, it wouldn't be falling back down because if it

26
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,720
goes up, up, up, up, up, and then there's no acceleration, no change over a certain amount of

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,420
time when just like, hover right there.

28
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,220
Would just stop and it would just hover, the reason why it comes back down is because of the acceleration

29
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,850
due to gravity at all points in the objects trajectory, it will be acted on by the acceleration due

30
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,390
to gravity, which is negative nine point eight meters per second squared.

31
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:14,790
OK, so for question to suppose you throw a ball straight up into the air at 20 meters per second,

32
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,660
describe the changes in velocity of the ball.

33
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,590
Describe the changes, that acceleration of the ball between which two seconds does the ball reach the

34
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,500
max height and hit the ground?

35
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,370
OK, so we know that initially.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,660
What's the ball's velocity?

37
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,120
20 meters per second.

38
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,670
What's its acceleration, negative, nine point eight.

39
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,300
The acceleration throughout the entire bus trajectory will be negative, nine point eight, so the Hayden

40
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,530
what we're just going to throw this out, bam, all the way down, negative nine point eight.

41
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:59,710
So for every one second, the ball's velocity will change by negative nine point eight meters per second.

42
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,870
That's what this means again.

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,460
So after one second, we have what's the velocity?

44
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,530
It would just be 20 minus the nine point eight, which gives us ten point two.

45
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,470
OK, so after two seconds, what's the ball's velocity?

46
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,290
Well, ten point two minus nine point eight, which gives us zero point for.

47
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,110
OK, and after three seconds, well, we have zero point for my nine point eight, which gives us negative

48
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:38,840
nine point four minus another nine point eight negative nineteen point two, minus another nine point

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,080
eight.

50
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,120
Negative twenty nine minus.

51
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,610
And negative minus nine point eight will give us a negative thirty eight point eight.

52
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,880
OK, I noticed that these numbers are a little bit they're not as nice looking or as friendly looking

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,800
as what we had before when I was describing the objects trajectory.

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,860
So.

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,560
OK, it kind of looks like nice, the idea that, you know what, we must nine point eight and we got

56
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,570
myself another nine point eight over here.

57
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,350
We got nine point eight.

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,750
There must be another nine point eight.

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,390
We got zero.

60
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,170
And it looks a lot more symmetric over here.

61
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,300
Right, versus this.

62
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,460
It's not as like nice and friendly is walking, right?

63
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,470
Well, there's a reason for that.

64
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,810
I did hear when I started it, when I set up this problem, all I did here was I took nine point eight,

65
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:45,780
multiplied it by three and it got twenty nine point four.

66
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:53,210
I know that when I subtract nine point eight and I'll get nineteen point six and then subtract another

67
00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:00,110
nine point eight, yet nine point eight and subtract another nine point eight had zero.

68
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:06,230
I can't multiply this by four or five or whatever the case is and I just made the numbers.

69
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,010
So it's super simple to actually see for a introduction.

70
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,990
I purposely did that, but so that was specifically for twenty nine point four.

71
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:17,920
Yes.

72
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,380
So that was specific for this number of twenty nine point four.

73
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,580
I said that this is our initial velocity and that's the logic behind it.

74
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,710
But now we're given an initial velocity of 20 meters per second.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,880
OK, so this is just our situation right now.

76
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,520
We're just given this and now it's just a little bit messier looking.

77
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,020
But two questions.

78
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,340
Between, what, two seconds does Ball reach the max hype?

79
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,820
Well, what do we know about the max height?

80
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,810
Isn't the velocity just going to be zero, so between which two seconds?

81
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,290
Well, it reached Mexi.

82
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,100
Doesn't it make sense?

83
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:08,220
I would be between these two seconds max height, because this is in between, well, zero will be in

84
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:08,790
between here.

85
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,120
Maybe it's a little bit closer to two and then it will be two to three.

86
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,060
OK.

87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,310
And between which two seconds does the ball hit the ground?

88
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:27,310
OK, maybe that's a little bit trickier, but don't we know that we see before that this is very symmetric?

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,790
So if I toss it up at twenty nine point four meters per second, once again, I'll hit the ground when

90
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:41,550
it's going to hit the ground at twenty nine point four meters per second, that's the velocity because

91
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:45,600
it's very symmetric path that takes so.

92
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,080
We know that the ball goes up at 20 meters per second.

93
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,980
You know what, it's going to come down and hit the ground at negative 20 meters per second, so it's

94
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,460
going to hit the ground between the fourth and the second.

95
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,470
Well, wait a minute.

96
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,190
How is it possible that actually reaches negative 29 and negative thirty thirty eight point eight meters

97
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,580
per second?

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,150
Well.

99
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,900
Maybe this is the situation for this problem, maybe we didn't actually toss it up and have it come

100
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:27,760
straight up and straight down, maybe what we did here was we were on a cliff and we tossed maybe we

101
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,420
were at the edge of a cliff and we decided to toss our object straight up.

102
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,390
And it comes down now that this is the level of the ground over here.

103
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:47,470
So it might have had not it reached the point of the velocity over here and zero meters per second and

104
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,200
then down over here, actually, I guess if this is the height that we're throwing it at now makes more

105
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,360
sense that it would be.

106
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,420
Negative 20 meters per second here and then over here, maybe we'll actually see that this is when it

107
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,950
reaches the 29 or negative 29 meters per second over here.

108
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:17,370
So and what it's just one of those situations where maybe we toss it up and it came down farther, we're

109
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,410
not really going to see that too much in this course.

110
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,240
Maybe your professor or your teacher, Mike Trickey, a little bit on something like that.

111
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,300
But just know the idea that the objects trajectory is very symmetric.

112
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,970
What you toss it at the initial velocity over here, it's going to equal to the the same velocity at

113
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,900
the same height.
