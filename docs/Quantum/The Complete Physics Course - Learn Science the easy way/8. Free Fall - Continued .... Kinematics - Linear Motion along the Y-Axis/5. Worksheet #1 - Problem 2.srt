1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,030
But let's hop into problem number two, one of the rides at an amusement park falls freely for one point

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:12,870
five seconds after starting from rest a what does its velocity at the end of the one point five seconds

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,340
be?

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,760
How far does it fall?

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,280
OK, so let's just reread this.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,500
We have a amusement park ride.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,520
It's fun freely for one point five seconds after starting from rest.

8
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:32,060
Oh, wow, that's the only information we have right now, so let's do our diagram so we have an object.

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,270
What does it do?

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,270
It's falling to the ground.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,560
I can actually just do this tick marks right here that indicate that that's the ground.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,640
And what is it doing, this is the objects trajectory and it is just falling.

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:55,860
We're not given the initial height of this object and we don't even know that the final height is zero,

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,120
huh?

15
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,250
OK, so it doesn't say that the object hits the ground, right?

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:02,840
Oh, boy.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,190
OK, so what we can actually say here is this.

18
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,720
Perspective number two, we could say that the initial height.

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,320
Is zero.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,110
And it's asking, how far does it fall?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,850
So once again, I looked at like looked at this like this is perspective one where you are given a initial

22
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,660
perspective to where you're not given an initial height.

23
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:34,290
You could just actually define that the initial size zero and come fall for a certain amount.

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,240
This will now be a negative number.

25
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,210
OK, so our initial height is going to be zero.

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,410
Finally, is what we're trying to find initial velocity, hey, are we throwing this object up or are

27
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,190
we throwing it down?

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,430
No, it's saying that's freely going to be falling.

29
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,630
So the initial velocity is going to be zero meters per second.

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,390
First question asks, what is its velocity at the end of the one point five seconds?

31
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,320
So we're actually going to be finding not just one thing, but we're going to be finding two.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,160
And once again, what is the acceleration of this freely falling object, negative, nine point eight

33
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,560
meters per second squared, that's acceleration due to gravity.

34
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,410
And our time here is one point five seconds.

35
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,710
OK, so once again, we're going to be finding two things.

36
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,160
So let's find the final velocity first.

37
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,860
So if we're trying to find this, what we're going to do here is say, hey, Noah, I don't care what

38
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,170
our final height is.

39
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,410
So this is going to be the thing that we don't care about first.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,120
And then when we're trying to find out the final height, what we're going to say is, hey, and what

41
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,510
I don't care about what this is equal to.

42
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,600
And that's the way that we're going to be determining which equations to be using.

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:03,080
So to find our final velocity, we're going to say to ourselves, I don't care what the final height

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,490
is of the object, I'm just going to race this diagram.

45
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,670
OK, so coming over here, OK, so where do we have a final.

46
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,760
Oh, so do we have final height over here.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,130
Wyeth now.

48
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,320
OK, we have Wyeth over here.

49
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,480
So I'm going to say I don't care about this one.

50
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,350
We have Wyeth right over here.

51
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,570
So I'm going to say I don't care about this one.

52
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:32,210
And we have Wyeth right here, so these ones won't help us out finding our final velocity.

53
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,580
But this one, well, so let's write that down.

54
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,790
OK, so that will help us finding out our final velocity, so let's do that first, let's just plug

55
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,730
this in and go from there.

56
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:55,160
OK, so Veth is equal to V.I., which is zero plus our negative nine point eight times our time, which

57
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,560
is one point five.

58
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,240
And when we play this into our calculator, we see that this zero provides no value.

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,380
So we could get rid of this.

60
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:11,420
We have a positive, we have a negative nine point eight times a positive one point five.

61
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,180
Would that result in a negative answer?

62
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:20,090
And when we play this in the calculator, we will get our answer of fourteen point seven metres per

63
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:20,750
second.

64
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:28,650
What does that negative represent, the idea that the object is being dropped and we know that velocities

65
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,720
are vectors, so therefore it does have to do with both a magnitude and our direction.

66
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,030
OK, well, that's for VCF, so we just did the problem is done.

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,190
What about Palm Bay?

68
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,540
How far does it fall?

69
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,730
OK, so we want to find out what our final height is going to be.

70
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,260
So therefore, let's not include this answer.

71
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,020
When we're trying to check this out, we're going to say that we don't care about this right now.

72
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,570
We could use this answer.

73
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,570
But the thing is, though, is that I don't want to use something that we calculated in order to calculate

74
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,280
out the next step.

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,950
I'd rather just use our given information if we got this wrong, if we actually did anything wrong here,

76
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,750
if we forgot to include our negative here, we will get this answer wrong right here.

77
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,990
So therefore, I don't want to use this value.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,750
So coming into here.

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,990
OK, so we're going to go through this right now and say the values that we don't care about is Veth.

80
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,150
So coming through here we have the effort there.

81
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,670
That's not going to help us find our final height.

82
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,900
This over here.

83
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,250
We have the math right there.

84
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,720
Don't care about this one.

85
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,600
Yes.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,860
Oh, we don't have the ethen here, but we do have VCF over here.

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,550
Process of elimination is great and there we go.

88
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,290
So we're just going to use equation number five, make sure that you actually write this all correct,

89
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,280
some mistake.

90
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,510
I do see what this this equation is for getting this squared right here.

91
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,660
OK, so we have a formula once again, just double double check to see that you have the formula right

92
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:58,860
now.

93
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,430
Correct.

94
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,390
And I believe that we do.

95
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:05,050
So once again, we're trying to find out what our our life is equal to.

96
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,690
One thing that's great is that it's very soldat for Wyeth.

97
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,410
So once we actually plug in these numbers right here, we could just toss this in the calculator and

98
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,070
get our answer.

99
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,530
OK, so we have this zero over here that's not going to provide any sort of value and we have zero times

100
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,380
one point five a no, that's not going to provide any value whatsoever.

101
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:37,990
So we have this positive one 1/2 times in negative nine point eight times, one point five squared Hazlitt's

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,840
negative times.

103
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,490
The positives will actually result in a negative answer.

104
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,010
So we have our Wyeth tossing this in the calculator.

105
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:53,510
We will get our answer of eleven point zero three meters.

106
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:04,240
And we should be including the negative here being that that's how much it drops, so I should really

107
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,670
just include that in there as well.

108
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,380
So that's how that's how far this object drops.

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,100
We do.

110
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,660
So think about this once again.

111
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,970
We have an amusement park ride that's really falling for one point five seconds.

112
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,410
How far does it fall?

113
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,120
It falls eleven point three meters.
