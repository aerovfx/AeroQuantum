1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,590
Bear with me here, this is going to be the very last formula.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,250
There's a lot that goes into this one.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:12,150
So we do have our average philosophy here, and that's equal to X Mass, X I divide by Delta T. Let's

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,620
take this and solve it up for X F.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,930
So how do we do this?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,420
Let's multiply both sides by Delta T. and then add xxxi onto both sides of the equation minus X by adding

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,050
to both sides equation.

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:35,590
We have the times, Delta T plus X I and that's equal to X f..

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,890
Now this is once again our average velocity and we know that average velocity is equal to this over

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,300
here.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,000
So let's do a substitution.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,650
So we have the I.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,350
Plus, VLF.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,620
Divide by two.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:03,000
And our Delta t hey now, what do you remember this formula from before?

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:11,580
I know that we actually solved this out to say that the physical TVI plus acceleration times Delta T,

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,180
but in this form, what we can actually do is solve this out for Delta T and the easiest way to actually

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,550
go about doing this once again, I explain this to you before, is we could do a simple switch out.

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:33,720
So we have Delta T is equal to the F minus V I divided by acceleration.

20
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,930
So Binet, this is what Delta is equal to.

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,370
Let's do a substitution so we have average velocity.

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,240
Times are Delta T.

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,840
And we're just going to do that substitution, so this is going to be multiplication because we're just

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,850
going to be dropping down our multiplication sign, right?

25
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:11,360
And this is going to be plus X, Y, and that's going to be equal to X F multiplying the denominators,

26
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,920
that's going to be fairly simple, right, because it's just to a multiply the numerators.

27
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,030
We're going to have to do a foil first outer inner west.

28
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,340
I'll tell you what, all math teachers, I hate the idea that everyone teachers foil.

29
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,020
All I actually think about this is it's a double distribution.

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,760
This is where I think about foil first.

31
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,630
Outr, isn't that just a distribution followed by another distribution, her?

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,350
Last, I think about this as it's a double distribution foil.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,630
OK, that's just another thing to memorize.

34
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,210
I like to conceptually think about it like this.

35
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,140
OK, so let's do the multiplication on this, let's just multiply this out.

36
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,890
All right, so the Times Veth.

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,290
OK, so that's the first one, and then we have a positive V.I. times, a negative V.I. So this is going

38
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,590
to give us a negative V.I. squared.

39
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,140
A positive becomes a positive.

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,390
Well, they'll give us a positive, the F squared I know, I just said V.I. there.

41
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,860
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,690
I apologize for that.

43
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,970
And then we have a positive V.I. times.

44
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:38,440
I'm sorry, a positive VEF times, a negative V.I. and that gives us a negative the I, the F and this

45
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:48,340
is all over to a I'm sorry, I apologize for mixing up the vehicles and Viarsa in my audio explanation

46
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,820
there and this is plus X Y and that's equal to X F.

47
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,770
OK, we have a little cancellation here.

48
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:05,620
We have a positive the times the F minus the items to be F, so these two will cancel out with each

49
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:05,950
other.

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,300
You see that?

51
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,610
So this is a positive.

52
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,570
This is a negative these to cancel out.

53
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,100
And all that we're left with is I'm just going to do a little reordering here, we have the F squared

54
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,710
minus V I squared.

55
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,710
Divided by two a.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,910
Plus X, Y, and that's equal to F.

57
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,860
Now I'm gonna do is solve this out for the F squared.

58
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,870
So here we go.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,670
Let's subtract X on both sides of the equation.

60
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,340
OK, now, once again, we're solving for the F squared, so let's get rid of this division of Twohey

61
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,530
by multiplying both sides of the equation by two.

62
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,890
I'm just gonna come over here to do that.

63
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,660
And now continuing to sell out for the squared, let's add the square to both sides of the equation.

64
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,800
And keep in mind, this is a positive to a times, this quantity over here, so.

65
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,540
And that is our final kinematic equation.
