1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,950
What we're going to do right now is we're just going to solve this out for our final velocity.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,040
So how do we go about doing that?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,600
Well, let's multiply by Delta T on both sides of the equation.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,070
We still want to isolate our final velocity.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,650
So how do we get rid of a negative initial velocity?

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,310
Let's add the initial velocity to both sides of the equation, and that's equal to our final velocity.

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,500
I could just simply just switch the left side in the right hand side of the equation.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,970
So I'm just going to rewrite this and this is our kinematic formula.
