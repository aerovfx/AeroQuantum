1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,820
We have Formula One, which represents our average philosophy and formulative, which represents our

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,460
average velocity, when I'm going to do right now is this I'm just going to rewrite the both of them.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,890
And set them equal to each other.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:25,540
Now, what I'm do is I'm going to solve this out for Veth I'm sorry EXIF and we'll get ourselves a third

5
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:26,850
kinematic formula.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,080
So how do I go about doing this.

7
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:37,220
OK, well if I want to isolate the access, I have a division of Delta T over here.

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,640
So what do I have to do.

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,210
I have to multiply Delta T on both sides of the equation.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,250
OK, so now that we have that let's add exi to both sides of the equation.

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:52,950
All right.

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,050
And we're just going to do one last thing here.

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:05,190
Looking at this, the eye plus de'ath divided by two isn't that's taking one half of the eye plus the

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,500
math.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,620
Isn't that just taking a half of it.

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,870
I could rewrite this and the very last thing is I'm just going to rearrange this.

17
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,930
I'm just going to put our exile in the front.

18
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,750
And this is our third kinematic equation.
