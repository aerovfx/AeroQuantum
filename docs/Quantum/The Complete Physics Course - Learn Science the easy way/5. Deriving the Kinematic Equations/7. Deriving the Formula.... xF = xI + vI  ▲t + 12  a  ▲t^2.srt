1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,950
OK, so now we're back over here.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:08,310
Notice that we do have our can magic formula that we just saw for them and there's a reason why I actually

3
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,360
brought back over here.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,780
And that's because what we're going to do right now is this.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:22,140
We have our final velocity right here and we know that final velocity is equal to V.I. plus a times

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,830
Delta T.

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,110
So I'm going to do is I'm just going to do a little substitution and then we're just going to simplify

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,470
this.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,670
So here we go, we have x, f.

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:44,380
Is equal to V.I. Plus, instead of writing are the F, I'm just going to write in the eye plus our acceleration

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,150
times Delta T.

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,040
And that's going to get multiplied by our Delta t notice once again.

13
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,070
That this got substituted in right in here.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,680
OK, so I'm just going to do a little simplification over here, what we do is first we have like terms,

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,950
so let's combine these like terms.

16
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,620
So we have XPath is equal two times to the I.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,850
Plus, our acceleration times Delta T.

18
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,610
Times, Delta tape, and now what we're going to do is this we're going to do two different distributions,

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,810
Ron distribute.

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:43,320
The one 1/2 to both of the terms and then we're going to distribute our Delta T.

21
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,570
To both of the terms as well.

22
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:55,720
We're just to do this all in one step, so we have X, F is he go to X I.

23
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,310
Plus.

24
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:03,240
So one half of two is just one.

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:11,850
So we have V.I. over here and we're going to multiply that by R Delta T so we have the I times Delta

26
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,270
T.

27
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:23,650
And then we have our one 1/2 times a times delta, so that's one half a Delta two, and then we have

28
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,860
Delta t.P multiply by that source, Delta T squared.

29
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,200
And this is another one of our kinematic formulas.
