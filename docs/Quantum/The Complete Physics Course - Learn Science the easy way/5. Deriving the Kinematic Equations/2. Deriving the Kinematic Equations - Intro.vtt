00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.290
All right, so right off the bat, let me warn you, this is going to be the most complex explanation

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.350
that you're going to get in this entire course and possibly all physics.

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.230
I'm going to be explain to you how kinematic equations are derived.

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.770
And this is an explanation that I know that a lot of physics teachers, either one freeze over or two,

5
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.350
don't explain to their students whatsoever.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.880
And they just give their students the kinematic formulas.

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.440
They say here's five kinematic formulas, we're going to use them.

8
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.900
Trust me, they work at very least by the end of this, you're going to have an appreciation for how

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.760
these formulas came about.

10
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.580
If you're able to stay with me throughout the explanation, I give you a lot of credit just for sticking

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.400
long, just bearing with me here.

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.290
It's gonna get very complex.

13
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.690
You're never going to be quizzed or asked to actually do this, at least at a high school level.

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.150
So don't feel like that you're going to need to do this.

15
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.970
But stick with me throughout this explanation.

16
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.440
I'll give you a lot of credit if you do.
