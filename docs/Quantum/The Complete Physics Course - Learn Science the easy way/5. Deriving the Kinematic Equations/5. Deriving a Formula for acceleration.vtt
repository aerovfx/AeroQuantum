00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.910
Now we're going to sidestep a little bit, notice that the motion diagram, it looks a little bit different

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.250
now.

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.670
Notice that we actually do have our velocity over here over time.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.430
And now we actually do have our velocity changing.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.210
Before our velocity was just constant.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.410
It just moved horizontally.

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.630
Now we actually do have it changing.

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.590
OK, so we're just going to do the same thing that we did before.

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.570
We're going to find the slope of this velocity over time graph.

10
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.650
And where does it go from there?

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.040
All right.

12
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.200
So we have these numbers should make sense considering what we've learned in the past.

13
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.520
And so this is equal to six over one.

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.990
In our units, it's meters per second per second.

15
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.580
So meters per second, per second.

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.060
And usually I do right, the SCC.

17
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.120
OK, so what is this actually telling us here?

18
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.850
What is what are these units actually mean?

19
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:16.660
So this is basically saying for every second the objects of velocity changes by six meters per second.

20
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.640
OK, so this is saying once again, let me just reread this for every once in the objects and velocity

21
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.810
changes by six meters per second.

22
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.510
What this is basically describing to us is actually an acceleration.

23
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.770
An acceleration is a change in velocity.

24
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.420
Over a certain amount of time.

25
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.840
Now, let me ask you this, when you are in the car with somebody and you're you're thinking to yourself,

26
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.650
I know what, this person's going a little too slow, he needs to speed up.

27
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.450
How do you actually go about saying that?

28
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.520
You basically say to them, hey, you need to accelerate.

29
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.920
And basically what you're saying is you need to change your velocity.

30
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.250
You need to go faster in a quick amount of time.

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.260
And that's basically what you're saying, hey, an acceleration, you need to accelerate or you can

32
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.040
actually say to yourself, hey, Noah, I think that my friend's going a little too, too fast right

33
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.160
now, considering the speed limit and they need to slow down.

34
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.630
How do you go about saying that?

35
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.810
Oh, you need to decelerate.

36
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.990
You need to go slower.

37
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.310
And that's what you're doing.

38
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.880
You're changing your velocity over a certain amount of time.

39
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.590
Now, once again, I'm actually just going to do right now is looking at this.

40
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.730
I'm just going to rewrite this.

41
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.430
So what is this eight represent?

42
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.490
Oh, that is our final velocity.

43
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.330
What is it to represent?

44
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.820
Oh, that's our initial velocity.

45
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:49.040
Divided by once again, I'm just going to write here instead of final time, this initial time, I'm

46
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.550
just going to represent that using R Delta T and this is our formula for acceleration.
