1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,010
As you will notice here, we do have our motion diagrams and there's something a little bit different

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,630
about this.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,690
Nothing really too much.

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:12,360
But you do actually see that I do have the letter X here for these problems.

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,680
Initially, what we're going to be doing for these kinematic can McFoy problems, what we're going to

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,530
deal with is actually having a car on the road and it's going to go in a certain direction and notice

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,500
that this is along the X axis as opposed to being on the Y axis.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,450
That's the reason why we're using an X here, is because it's just describing the access that we're

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,670
working on and that's the change in position.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,730
What I want to do here is you should actually just be reviewing this and make sure that this makes sense

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,160
to you.

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,190
I know that there's a horrible squiggle.

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,600
I meant to do something like this, bam, right there.

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,360
All right.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:53,250
So this should actually make sense to you, considering that we went over motion diagrams in the previous

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,740
lectures.

17
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,830
Now, what I want to do right here is I know that we're using Wyeth Mazwai over EXI.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,580
Let's just do a little substitution.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,840
So this A-T, what does this represent.

20
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,170
Well that's the final position, right.

21
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,790
And the final position.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:15,510
We're going to be declaring that the letter X. So instead of using Wyeth, I'm going to use F because

23
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:20,910
once again we're using this X here and that's the final position of this object minus.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,680
And the T represents the initial position, which is once again denoted to this X.

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,410
So this is the initial exposition divide that by and the denominator we have the three minus one.

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,580
What is the three represent?

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,720
Well, that's the time.

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,860
That is the time in the final possession or the final time, I should actually say minus the initial

29
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,460
time.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,810
And once again, this represents our velocity.

31
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,920
This is our average velocity.

32
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,390
Another way to go about writing are T minus T.

33
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,640
We're just going to write it like this, this is a triangle.

34
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,010
This is called Delta.

35
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,790
This is a Greek symbol, the Greek symbol, Delta.

36
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,630
It just represents the change in.

37
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,090
So it's the change in the amount of time.

38
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,250
This is one of our kinematic formulas that we will be using.

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,820
Now, what's going to velocity?

40
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,150
What is that?

41
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,290
It's the change in position

42
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,060
over a certain amount of.

43
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,200
Time, which is exactly what we have represented here, this is our average velocity.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,470
OK.

45
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,550
Well, how else do you actually get an average thing about this, say, if I have the numbers three

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,360
and five, how do I get the average of these two numbers?

47
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,680
Oh, wait a minute.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,320
I could just add them and divide by two.

49
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,150
So we have eight over two, which is equal to four.

50
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,200
And that's the average four is the average of three and five.

51
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:10,950
So keeping this concept in mind, if I'm given an initial velocity and a final velocity, can't I just

52
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,530
add this up, divide them by two and also get our average velocity?

53
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,780
Well, yeah, and that's a nother kinematic formula right there.

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:26,970
So these two formulas both describe how to calculate the average velocity.
