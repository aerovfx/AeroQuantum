00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.390
Are you ready, are you ready?

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:01.780
OK.

3
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.080
Intro, intro, introduction in today's topic is drum roll, please.

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.840
But a little a little kinematics.

5
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.450
This study of how objects move.

6
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:22.480
Notice how I said how objects move and not why objects move, why objects move has to do with forces.

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.540
And we're not going to be discussing that right now.

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.290
We will be, but not right now.

9
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.250
We're going to be discussing how they move and we're going to do that by using kinematic equations.
