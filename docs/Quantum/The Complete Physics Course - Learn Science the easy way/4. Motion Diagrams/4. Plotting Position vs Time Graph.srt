1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,810
So the instruction tell us to create the plot on the position versus time graph, then calculate the

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,260
velocities and plot them on the velocities first time graph.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,340
So the given information is we are at home right now and it says location on the right hand side.

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:22,090
That home is located at position of zero meters.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,490
We're in a rush to get to the grocery store in 15 minutes.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,720
OK, so it's going to take us 15 minutes to get to the grocery store, which is located at the position

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,680
of 60.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,230
We're going to shop for food for ten minutes at the grocery store, which is that position 60.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,910
And we're no longer in a rush to get to our friend's house, which is a 10 minute drive.

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,720
The friend's house is at the position 40.

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,600
So I'm just going to take these and just plot them notes that we have position in the Y axis and time

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
in minutes on the X axis.

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,780
So we're at home right now, which is position zero.

14
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,830
That's the reason why we're starting over here, is because we're at position zero at zero minutes.

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,610
So if you're looking at the X axis, you have five right here, 10, 15.

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,580
OK, so in 15 minutes, we're going to be going to the grocery store.

17
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,590
So we're in a rush to get to the grocery store, which is a position of 60 meters.

18
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,470
OK, so we have our 60 meters over here.

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,880
We have a 15 minutes over here.

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,520
Let's just drive dot right there.

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,630
All right, so this is looking good right now, we're in the creation process of our motion diagram

22
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,170
and we're going to be spending 10 minutes shopping for food at the grocery store.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,400
So keep in mind that each one of these tick marks, it represents five minutes.

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,460
So we're going to be spending 10 minutes here at the grocery store.

25
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,360
Apposition, 60, so we're now leaving the grocery store and we're going to our friend's house, which

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,820
is located at position 40, and it's going to take us 10 minutes to get there.

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:04,260
OK, so we're over here right now and it's going to take us 10 minutes to get there over at position

28
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:04,800
40.

29
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,110
So we're just to draw another dot right here.

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,490
Don't look at this 40 and say, hey, you know what?

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,640
Oh, that's 40.

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,600
So therefore, we're going to go there because keeping in mind that this is time and this is our position.

33
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,630
So we want to go to the position of 40 and we're just going to draw our line over here and now I know

34
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,620
that does say this in the instructions, but we're just coming hang out our friends house, watching

35
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,240
the football game, doing whatever.

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,580
So this is our position versus time graph for our motion diagram.
