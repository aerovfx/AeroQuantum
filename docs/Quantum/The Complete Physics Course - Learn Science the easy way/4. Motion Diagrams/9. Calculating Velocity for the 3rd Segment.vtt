00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.200
OK, so let's calculate the velocity for a segment number three.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.360
Now, once again, what we're going to do here is change up where our initial and final positions are.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.180
Now, we're over here at this position.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.400
This is going to be our initial position.

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.750
And over here, this is going to be our final position for this third segment.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.790
So let's plug in our numbers.

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.030
Y F is going to be 40.

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:41.660
Minus Y, which is sixty, divided by X, F, which is thirty five minus X I, which is 25.

9
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.420
40 minus 60 is a negative twenty, divided by thirty five, minus 25 is ten.

10
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.040
So we have a slope here of negative two meters per minute.

11
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.150
Hey, so that's a negative slope there and does that make sense?

12
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.300
I mean, so if you're looking at this.

13
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.470
You see that this slope is going upwards if we're moving from left to right.

14
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.170
This slope is moving.

15
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.720
It's not moving up or down at all, and this slope, if you're moving from left to right, it's going

16
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.370
downwards once again.

17
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.460
If you're moving from left to right, it's going downwards.

18
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.790
Right.

19
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.190
So that's the reason why we do have a negative slope there.
