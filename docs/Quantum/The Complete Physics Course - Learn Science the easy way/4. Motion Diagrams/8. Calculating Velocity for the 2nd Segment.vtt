00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.180
OK, so we just calculated the velocity for the first segment, so I'm actually just going to call this

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.260
velocity one and I'm I'm just going to denote that by saying this.

3
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.400
So that's our indicator.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.030
That's our first velocity.

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.820
Now, we still need to calculate the other velocities over here for segments two, three and four.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.830
So how do we go about doing that?

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.460
I'm going to do a little erasing here because I wasn't really saving myself too much room in order to

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.720
calculate these other ones out.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.130
And I apologize for that.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.400
But here we go.

11
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.050
So what I'm going to start you race.

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.010
Is this in here?

13
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:47.170
So for for kicking out the slope of segment number two, what we're going to do here is change our initial

14
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.220
and final positions.

15
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.310
So now, now.

16
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.470
So before we start over here and we were over here.

17
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.320
So this is our initial position and our final position.

18
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.930
Now we're over here.

19
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.110
This is our initial position and this is our final position.

20
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.210
So let's plug in our numbers, why f well, r y is 60 for F.

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.920
Minus why I oh, that's also 60.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.730
Divided by x f, which is 25.

23
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.860
Minus EXI, which is 15.

24
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.890
60 miles, 60 is zero, divide that by any number.

25
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.850
And our answer is going to be zero.

26
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.070
Meters per minute.

27
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.050
And this is our velocity to.

28
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.090
Wait a minute, so does that make sense that we would have a varsity of zero here?

29
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.940
Well, yes, it should, because we're tackling the slope of these lines.

30
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:08.420
And is this segment is this would you describe this to be sloping up or sloping down or does it have

31
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.300
no slope?

32
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.500
I wouldn't say that that has any slope at all whatsoever.

33
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.520
I mean, if I was to be going skiing and I saw that that's the held I'm skiing on, I'd be rather rather

34
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.340
annoyed being that it has no slope.

35
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.380
And that's exactly that what we see here.

36
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.740
And that's what we calculated that has zero slope because over that period, what we did was we just

37
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.490
shopped at the grocery store for that amount of time.

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.960
We didn't move from the grocery store at all.

39
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.280
Maybe we did a little bit around inside the grocery store, but we're not included in that.

40
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.570
We stayed at the position of the grocery store for that 10 minutes.
