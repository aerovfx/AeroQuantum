1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,690
Now, let's think of different examples of velocity.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,930
Well, think about the traffic signs that you saw on your drive to school today.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,150
So maybe you actually saw a sign here in the United States.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:20,600
You might see a sign that says, hey and what the speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:29,360
Maybe it was actually written like this 25 mph, but that's the same thing, say 25 miles an hour,

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,280
written like this.

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,740
And what does that mean?

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,830
Hey, no, once again, I think I actually mentioned this in the previous lectures, but it's.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:44,010
Going at this velocity, you'll be moving 25 miles in one hour.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,560
That's what this means.

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:55,220
So you're changing your position of 25 miles over the certain amount of time, which is one hour, for

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,380
our example, over here, we're changing our position four meters in one minute.

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,390
And that's what its velocity is.

14
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:08,630
The velocity is a change in position over a certain amount of time.
