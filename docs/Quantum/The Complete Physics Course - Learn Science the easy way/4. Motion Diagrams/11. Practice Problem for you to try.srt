00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,390
If you really want me to go into a little bit more depth in detail with motion diagrams, just let me

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,430
know in the comments section and I will do that.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,050
But for this next example, you could feel free to try this on your own.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,490
Just keep in mind that when you're doing this, this phrasing here is not the greatest.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,630
I understand that.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,560
But just understand that when they're jogging back there, jogging back 40 miles past home, if homes

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,250
located at zero meters where 40 meters past I'm going to be and what we're referring to this over here.

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:36,150
So just keep that in mind when you're going past home, try this out.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,460
I'm not going to give an explanation on how to do this in the video, but I will include the answer

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,350
key along with the resources.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,550
So check that out.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,430
Compare your answers and good luck to you.
