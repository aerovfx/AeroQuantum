00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:07.530
All right, so for the fourth segment, let's calculate the slope so we have the initial position over

2
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.770
here and the final position over here.

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.750
Well, you know, what do we really need to calculate the slope?

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.130
Let me ask you this.

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.870
Is this slope moving up or down at all?

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.900
What's the value of the slope?

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.090
All right.

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.590
So hopefully you're saying to yourself, in a way it's not slipping at all, are slope is going to be

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.690
zero meters per minute.

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.120
You calculate that out if you want to.

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.550
I personally wouldn't waste my time, but if you want to check it out, that's up to you.

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.050
OK, so I think that we're ready to start graphing these on the velocity versus time graph down here.

13
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
You could actually just see that our units here are the time.

14
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.330
And so that's what we have over here.

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.620
I'm just going to bring this up to notice here that we do have our velocity, which is meters over minute,

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.400
and we do have our time on the X axis.

17
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.930
So what I like to do with these is elected draw a nice little line coming down like this at each one

18
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.820
of these points.

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.630
So let's do that.

20
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.680
A key key, key key, here we go, here we go, here we go.

21
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.600
All right.

22
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.240
So for the first segment, we have four meters per minute.

23
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.680
It's going at a constant velocity for four meters per minute.

24
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.490
For that entire 15 minutes, we're going four meters per minute for velocity till we have zero meters

25
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.930
per minute.

26
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.200
So we're just going to do for segment two.

27
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.970
We have zero.

28
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.570
Some teachers might actually want a a line coming down here for connection like this.

29
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.620
I don't really have a preference, I would doubt that your teacher would actually really have a preference

30
00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.950
on that.

31
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.950
But just let you know, some people actually do do that.

32
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.620
I don't.

33
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.110
I see.

34
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.280
The full importance of that.

35
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.760
All right, so for velocity three, we have negative two meters per minute, so we're just gonna plot

36
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.080
that out over here.

37
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.270
And for velocity four, we just are going to be drum like this, all right, so we just completed this.

38
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.660
We calculated out our velocities and we plotted them on the velocity versus time graph.

39
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.820
And those are our motion diagrams.
