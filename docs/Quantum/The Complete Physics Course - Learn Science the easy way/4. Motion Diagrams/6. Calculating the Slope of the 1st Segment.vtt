00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.420
So do you remember the slope of the line formula?

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.150
Let me help you out here.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.250
So we have slope is equal to.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.480
Do you remember this?

5
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.190
Rise over, run.

6
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.920
Maybe your teachers taught you that maybe not so safe, we're actually just looking at this first segment,

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.700
we're going from here to over here.

8
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.710
Let's call this point one and point two.

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.290
So we have the rise, which is the why.

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.620
It's Whitehill minus Y one.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.640
Divide by X two, minus X one, maybe that sounds familiar to you.

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.390
You know what it said?

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.920
These are ones and twos over here.

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.390
Instead of that, I'm actually just going to change it up a little bit.

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.610
I'm going to use an eye for initial or starting place and F for the final position.

16
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.750
So we have the initial position and the final position.

17
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:09.240
So I'm just going to change this up a little bit, say that this is equal to Y F minus Y, I divided

18
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.500
by X, X minus X.

19
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.980
I notice it's basically the same thing, but instead of using ones and twos where I'm using eyes and

20
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.750
FS, so y f well the final position is over here.

21
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:28.740
The Y value is 60 minus.

22
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.380
Why.

23
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.050
OK, so the initial height of this position is zero.

24
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.380
Divided by.

25
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:47.230
XPath, well, the X F is AR 15 minus X I is zero.

26
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.680
So we have 60 divide by 15 and, you know, I didn't include in the units, so I'm actually just going

27
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.520
to do that right now.

28
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.560
So we have meters and minutes.

29
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:06.940
So we have 60 meters and 15 minutes to do the division over here.

30
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.920
If you did this in the calculator or hopefully in your head, you'll see that it's four meters over

31
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.400
minutes and meters over minutes that actually tells us a velocity.

32
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.230
This the slope over here of a position versus time graph gives us the velocity.
