00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,060
OK, so we just completed the first set of instructions, which is to create the plot, the position

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,050
versus time graph.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,530
Now we need to also then calculate the velocities.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,010
So let me ask you this.

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,340
If we wanted to find the slope of each one of these segments, how we go about doing this.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,480
So by the segments, what I actually mean by this is let's call the segment number one.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,540
Segment number two, segment number three and segment number four, so say, if we want to find the

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,180
slope of each one of these segments, how we go about doing this, what is the formula to calculate

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,500
the slope of a line?
