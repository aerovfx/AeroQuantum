1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,420
But let's go into the next one right now.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,680
Problem number two says during a three second time interval, a runner's position changes from 50 meters

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,530
to thirty point five meters.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,880
What is the runner's average velocity?

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,840
OK, well, let's talk about this here.

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,390
It says.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:23,410
During a three second time interval, the runners position changes from this to this.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,230
OK, well, what is this three seconds to represent?

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,850
Oh, hopefully you're saying that that's our Delta T.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,630
And what is this 50 meters represent?

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,770
What does that tell us?

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,370
That's where he's starting.

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,300
That's the initial position of the runner.

14
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,410
And what is what about this thirty point five meters?

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,370
Well, that's where he's ending up, right?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,320
Or she or whatever the success of the runner.

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,040
And it's asking us what is the runners average velocity, that's what we're trying to find.

18
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,060
How about that?

19
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,380
So and once again, to really clarify this for the position is going to be measured in meters.

20
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:13,300
We do have time measured in seconds and our velocity, the units should be meters per second.

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,320
So once again, we do know that we're trying to find the runners average velocity.

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,180
Which formulas do we want to use?

23
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,040
One, two, three, four or five or six?

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,360
Hopefully you're saying formula is one or two being that those are the ones that have to do with average

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,020
velocity?

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,550
And are we giving our initial velocity and final velocity now?

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,890
But we are given the initial position and final position.

28
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,210
So therefore, hopefully you're saying, hey, you know what, we have initial and final position in

29
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,520
equation number one.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,310
Let's use that.

31
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:49,460
And all we have to do is plug in, oh, this is simple enough because we actually have the very poll

32
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,560
that we're looking for on the left hand side of the equation by itself already.

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,290
So are we going to have to do is take this plug it into the calculator and we'll get our answer.

34
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,160
So we have our final position, which is our thirty point five minus our initial position of fifty,

35
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,610
and we divide that by three and we'll play this in the calculator, we'll get an answer of, wow, this

36
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,810
is a negative number.

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,940
Six point five in our units, which are calculator won't tell us, but we do know it because we know

38
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:28,590
that every velocity gets measured in meters per second when we're dealing with meters and seconds.

39
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,710
OK, so this is our answer.

40
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,100
Now, you might be saying to yourself, oh, wait a minute, why is it negative?

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,930
What's what's going on there?

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:45,060
Well, OK, so thinking about this, say if we look at this problem, look as if it's on a number line

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,610
where we have a zero over here and we're going across x axis.

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,230
Well, our position initially is at 50 and we're going.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,140
To thirty point five, that's what the runners deal, right?

46
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,690
So the runner is going backwards.

47
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,230
What do you think that that negative represents?

48
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:18,670
That's the direction because of velocity, it's a vector and vectors have both magnitude and direction,

49
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,940
that negative is representing our direction.
