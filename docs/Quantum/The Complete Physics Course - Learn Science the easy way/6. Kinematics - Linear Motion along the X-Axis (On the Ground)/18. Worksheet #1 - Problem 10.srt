1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,920
OK, and here we go for a problem number 10, so a bus is moving at 24 meters per second when the driver

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,790
steps on the brakes and brings the bus to stop in three seconds.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:15,040
What is the average acceleration of the bus while braking?

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,710
OK, so this bus is just kind of slowing down.

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,390
Brings the bus to stop.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,520
OK, so I know it's going a certain speed, the bus driver slammed on the brakes and took a bus to stop.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,060
That's the situation, right?

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,470
OK, so let's think about this was the initial position and what nothing specifically given to us.

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,600
So we're just going to say zero.

10
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,550
What does this 24 meters per second represent?

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,930
What does that tell us?

12
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:51,700
OK, so hopefully you're saying to yourself that this is our initial velocity, the twenty four meters

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,660
per second.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,560
When the driver steps on the brakes and brings the bus to a stop, so it brings a bus to a stop.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,650
What does that tell us?

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,560
That should be telling us that the final velocity is equal to zero.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,370
Time span of three seconds.

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,570
What is the average acceleration of the bus?

19
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,170
OK, so that's simple enough, very straightforward, and it says nothing about the final position and

20
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,840
that's going to be the variable that we simply just don't care about.

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,760
OK, so come back over here.

22
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:33,420
So Zeph is the variable that we don't care about.

23
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,870
Let's go through here once again.

24
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,490
We're not dealing with our average velocity.

25
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,880
So we're coming down through here looking at these over here.

26
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,810
So EXIF, we're looking for zaffar.

27
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,060
We don't have Zeph over here.

28
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,040
That's a good potential candidate right there.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,610
All right.

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,930
We do have Zeph over here and we simply do see we have excess Zeph over here.

31
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,270
These are not going to be for us.

32
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,010
And coming through over here, we have oh, there's Zeph right there.

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,040
So we're not interested in those.

34
00:01:59,230 --> 00:01:59,870
How about that?

35
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:00,170
All right.

36
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,480
That's just our very first formula that we initially suspected that it would be.

37
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:14,340
So let's just write that down so we have the AF is equal to V.I. plus our acceleration times our Delta

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,050
T, let's plug in and go from there CERV.

39
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,760
V.I..

40
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,760
Our acceleration times three.

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,750
OK, so we're just gonna have to solve our acceleration, so we do have two terms here.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,860
We have one term over here, which is just the twenty four in our second term is going to be R eight

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,910
times three.

44
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,670
Once again, terms are separated by plus and minus signs.

45
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,050
You might actually remember hearing about terms when you say to yourself, hey, you know what, let's

46
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,370
group up the like terms.

47
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,960
So if we actually have our two X plus five X and Y, are these like terms?

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,740
Yes, they are.

49
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,550
So once again, terms are separated by plus and minus signs.

50
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,970
So R A is what we need to isolate and let's just get rid of our first term over here.

51
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,930
Let's get rid of this positive 24.

52
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:07,920
How do we get rid of a positive.

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
Twenty four simply by subtracting twenty four on both sides of the equation and that will give us this.

54
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,980
And how do we get rid of this multiplication of three.

55
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,480
Simply divide both sides by three and we'll we will get our negative eight meters per second squared

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,470
and that's equal to our acceleration, which is the answer that we get right there.

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,550
I've got one more question for you about this problem.

58
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,670
Why is the answer negative?

59
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,510
Why is it negative eight meters per second squared?

60
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,980
Why isn't it eight meters per second squared?

61
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,880
Why is it negative?

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,480
And don't tell me it's because this is negative right here.

63
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,770
OK, so the reason why it's negative is simply because.

64
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,320
It's a deceleration in, aren't we breaking right now?

65
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,310
Isn't this actually coming to a stop?

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,280
So we are describing it's it's not accelerating.

67
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,480
It's decelerating.

68
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:12,350
And what that might have signed scientists represents a negative acceleration or a deceleration.
