00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,810
I will be referring to this -- over here while going through these problems, so I will be bouncing

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,410
back and forth between this sheet and the worksheet itself.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,820
One thing I really want you to do is actually just go through this and make sure that you have a good

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,630
understanding of that position.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,940
We're going to be using EXI and access the units that it's going to be measured in meters for velocity.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:28,110
We're going to be using v the IVF and the units are meters per second.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:35,940
Acceleration is going to be A and that's meters per second squared and the time elapsed is Delta T and

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,470
that's going to be measured in seconds.

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,230
For the most part, these are the units that we will be associating with these variables.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,570
So just keep that in mind.
