1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,560
At this point, we've already done a handful of these palms together, if you choose to.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:10,620
I'm going to invite you to try the rest of these palms on your own if you are not fully feeling comfortable

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,140
just yet.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,830
That's OK.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,410
Let's work on them together.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,720
And at some point, I just would like to encourage you to pause the video and try some of these on your

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,170
own now.

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:19,550
All right.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,750
So without further ado, let's get into the palm.

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:28,140
Number seven, a car accelerates uniformly from rust to 18 meters per second, which is equivalent to

11
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,660
roughly 40 miles an hour in six point five seconds.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,650
Find the distance the car traveled during this time.

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,520
OK, so what do we have here?

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,600
We have a car and it's going to start from here and it's going to travel over here in the time span

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,630
of six point five seconds, OK?

16
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:55,360
It's saying that starting from rest, OK, so it's can go from over here to over here in the time span

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:03,700
of six point five seconds, it says it accelerates uniformly that basically that's just meaning is is

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,660
constantly accelerating.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,780
So it's another word for constant acceleration.

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,920
I wouldn't really put too much thought into it.

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:10,300
All right.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,100
So let's just get into this and start writing out.

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,690
Given information, what would you say that the initial position of the car is hopefully by now you're

24
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,030
getting the point of this and saying that's zero.

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,080
It's not being specified to us what the position of the car is initially.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,810
So we're just going to say it's equal to zero.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,680
And then what do we got?

28
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,420
Car accelerates uniformly from rest.

29
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,440
Oh, if it's at rest, what does that tell us about our initial velocity?

30
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:46,480
And it's going to 18 meters per second, what is 18 meters per second telling us, hopefully you're

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,980
saying that that's our final velocity.

32
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,680
Our key indicator here is that tells us the units of meters per second.

33
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,940
That's our indicator, saying that that's our velocity.

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,960
If you're not picking up on the idea of these units by now, when I highly suggest you do is come back

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,820
over here, you look at these quantities and the associated units and you just kind of memorize these.

36
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,800
And I hate to use the word memorized, but at certain times he kind of just Neotel.

37
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,310
All right, so what else do we have?

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,960
We already have our 18 meters per second and then six point five seconds.

39
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,120
Well, that's simply the time elapsed.

40
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:33,170
And it's asking us to find the distance the car traveled, what's going to be the final position, right?

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,120
All right, and what do we not care about, what is acceleration being given here?

42
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,210
A tells us the car is accelerating but doesn't give us any information about the acceleration whatsoever.

43
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:54,950
I mean, we do see that the car does go from an initial velocity of zero to a final velocity of 18 meters

44
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,650
per second, which is the definition of acceleration.

45
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,910
But we're not given any information about the acceleration and it's not asking us about the acceleration.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,260
So that's the variable that we don't care about.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,450
So coming through here, first of all, is the problem having to do with the average velocity?

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,570
No, right.

49
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,140
So we're just going to come back down here once again, looking through here, does it have to do with

50
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,700
average velocity now?

51
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,380
So we're just going to be identifying these equations over here, looking for our the variable that

52
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,080
we don't care about, which once again is acceleration.

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,810
So over here, we have acceleration right there.

54
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,300
We don't care about this one.

55
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,390
That's not our formula.

56
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,250
What about this one?

57
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,020
No.

58
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,480
OK.

59
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,270
And what about this one?

60
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,670
Oh, we got acceleration right there.

61
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,400
We don't care about this one.

62
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,570
And for this formula right here, we got acceleration right there.

63
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,420
So we don't care about that formula.

64
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,610
So very simply, we're going to be using formula number four.

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,920
And I'm just going to erase our beautiful drone right there.

66
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,480
So let's just plug in and let's solve out for this.

67
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,220
All right.

68
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,390
So our final position, look at that.

69
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:17,120
This is going to be really simple being that we have the variable already isolated.

70
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,180
Oh, that's so nice.

71
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,710
OK.

72
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,950
OK, so we actually have this zero right here that's going to provide any value.

73
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,700
What about this zero here that provides no value?

74
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,820
So let's just plug this into our calculator.

75
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,500
We have one 1/2 and that's being multiplied by our 18.

76
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,620
And that's being multiplied by our six point five.

77
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:59,470
Just keep in mind and what this is one 1/2 times a positive 18 times six point five.

78
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,370
This is not one 1/2 plus 18.

79
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,310
We have one 1/2.

80
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,120
And then that positive 18 is wrapped in parenthesis.

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,190
That tells us that's one 1/2 times a positive 18 times six point five.

82
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,430
Don't get that confused.

83
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,930
OK, so we're just going to plug this into our calculator and we'll get the final answer of fifty eight

84
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,810
point five meters.
