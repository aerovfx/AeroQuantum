1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,200
Number three, how far could a cyclist travel in kilometers or kilometers in 2.5 hours, a long straight

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,260
road if her average velocity is 18 kilometres per hour?

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,260
Keep in mind that 18 kilometers per hour is roughly 11 miles an hour.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,980
OK, so let's think about this once again.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,860
Let's read this again.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,730
How far can a cyclist travel in this much time along a straight road if her average velocity is this?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,660
OK, so let's say that the cyclist is starting right here and we're trying to figure out, hey, how

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,440
far could the cyclist travel in a certain amount of time?

9
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,710
Let me ask you something, if you're starting right here, what would you say that the initial position

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,290
is of this person or do you actually say to us now, let's just say that's going to be called a zero?

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,410
And we're doing this in kilometres, so I'm just going to write that 10 kilometres.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,410
So looking at this, what does this 2.5 hours represent?

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,900
Oh, that's our Delta T..

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,900
Hmm, OK.

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,660
And I know that we actually were saying before that we were going to be using meters and seconds, but

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,800
as of right now, it looks like kilometres and hours, let's say, here.

17
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,260
And then it says the average velocity is 18 kilometers per hour.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:25,230
OK, so our average velocity is 18 kilometres per hour had been that we're actually using kilometres

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,650
and hours in every single part of our problem right now.

20
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,000
That's OK, because it's like one of those things where the units, they will just work with each other,

21
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,920
but we can't really mix and match between using kilometres and meters per second or meters and kilometres

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,310
per second.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,860
We really can't mix and match.

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:52,050
But if all of our units are, we have kilometres here, kilometres per hour here and we've ours over

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,400
here.

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,160
Hey, know what?

27
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,130
Those are all kind of like a line with each other.

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,610
That's one of those situations where you're like eight.

29
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,670
I could just work with the sear.

30
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:07,710
These units look like I'm not really crossing between hours and kilometres per second or and just really

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,310
mix matching.

32
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,740
My units were just staying consistent over here.

33
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,390
And that's OK.

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,120
We could do that.

35
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,170
This is one of the situations where you could just be not having to use meters and seconds and meters

36
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,480
per second units and everything.

37
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,150
So and it's asking us how far can the cyclist travel?

38
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,680
That's what the question is.

39
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,230
So if it's if the cyclist is starting over here and ending up over here, well, isn't that just simply

40
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,650
the final position, how far the cyclist is going to travel?

41
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,050
So that's what we're going to be finding right now.

42
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:44,730
And if we're looking at our formulas, once again, we were given an average velocity.

43
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,420
So therefore, which formulas do we want to be using?

44
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,900
Hopefully you're saying that we want to be using that one of the first two formulas that that has to

45
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,090
do with the average velocity.

46
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,380
So which one of these foremost we want to use?

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
Well, we don't have our initial velocity or final velocity.

48
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,120
So once again, we're just going to be using this one right now.

49
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,590
I know that this seems a little repetitive and everything, but these are different principles, different

50
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,210
kind of concepts that I want to be covering in the first few problems before actually getting into the

51
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,200
thick of it and everything.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,250
So, OK, so we just simply plug this in.

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,740
And what do we have here?

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,260
So we have our 18, that's our average velocity, our final position.

55
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,660
That's what we're trying to find.

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:34,710
Our initial position, which is zero divide, that by two point five, the obstruction of zero doesn't

57
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,270
provide any sort of value.

58
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,150
Being that we have a division of 2.5, what do we do?

59
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:47,850
We multiply both sides of the equation by 2.5 and we get our final position of 45 kilometres.

60
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,960
And that's the final answer for that one, usually, once again, our position is typically in meters,

61
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,260
but once they've been pumping that, we were consistent with our kilometres over here.

62
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,540
Our final answer will be in kilometres.
