00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.230
Now, it's your turn attached to this video is workshy kinematics worksheet number to try this on your

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.380
own and there is going to be a Kanzaki attached to this as well.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.550
So try this on your own.

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.250
That's what you and let me know in the comments if you have any questions, even after checking out

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.090
explanation's.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.210
So I'm just going to go through this worksheet, which is kind of breezed through right now.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.820
So we actually have questions one through three so that those look very familiar, four, five and six

8
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430
to seven.

9
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.160
All right.

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400
So notice what's missing.

11
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.520
I am taking away some of your training wheels right now.

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.630
That's why I like to call it.

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.640
So you're going to have to fill this in.

14
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.180
And what I don't want to say is when you're doing these problems, when you're actually working them

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.430
on your job by yourself, I cannot stress this enough.

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.800
Why I don't want to see you do is actually just do this.

17
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.920
I have the I the math acceleration.

18
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.700
Delta ti OK, next one.

19
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.180
I have so on, so forth and then coming down here writing them all out, that's not going to help you.

20
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.960
What you should really be doing now and I cannot stress this enough.

21
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.220
Fill out all this information for this problem, do you see the problem, OK, Ben, go on to the next

22
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.480
one.

23
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.250
All this information do the problem.

24
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.580
Next one, fill this out, do the problem.

25
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.240
It's young.

26
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.750
Get you into the habit of actually having this be a lot more systematic the way that you go about approaching

27
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.990
this.

28
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.450
And it's just good practice.

29
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.390
It's just good for your memorization, because when you come down here, notice that all of your training

30
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.420
wheels are gone.

31
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.810
So we want to be able to practice this.

32
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.670
And once again, for this problem, you fill out your given information, do your problem, bam, next

33
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.370
one do to given information to the problem.

34
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.190
Notice how nice of an approach this is.

35
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.660
It's very systematic.

36
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.920
You're actually going to be able to benefit from these practices.

37
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.180
And I really hope that for your class that this actually really helps you out going from having these

38
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.880
training wheels and then actually just taking them away.

39
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.260
But you're going to have the practice to be able to just do this on your own.

40
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.070
And I'd like to think that you're probably going to be ahead in your class and having to show other

41
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.550
classmates how to go about doing this if you're that kind of person or whatever.

42
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.440
But yeah, so try this out.

43
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.880
Like I said, I'm actually just going to attach a and answer key as well.

44
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.920
So feel free to actually look at that.

45
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.970
I highly suggest.

46
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.670
Don't you look at that until you're done with this worksheet and can do your comparison and I'm sure

47
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.590
that you know that.

48
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.190
OK, well, good luck to you.
