00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.370
OK, so well, let's go on and go through problem number eight once again, I'm going to encourage you

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.180
to pause this video at this point, try some of these problems on your own.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.400
Like I said before, I do have another worksheet for you.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.840
So don't be feeling like a what?

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.930
I don't feel like that.

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.250
I'll have enough problems over here.

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.380
I need to do this on my own.

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.780
Trust me, I have enough for you to be doing on your own.

9
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.250
All right.

10
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.540
So with that said, let's go through this problem, or like I said before, pause the video, try out

11
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.050
on your own.

12
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.300
But let's go through this problem right now with an average acceleration of zero point five meters per

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.060
second squared.

14
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.610
How far does a cyclist travel if starting from rest and reaches seven meters per second, which is sixty

15
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.300
miles an hour?

16
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.480
OK, so let's read this again with an average acceleration of this.

17
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.140
How far does a cyclist travel if starting from rest?

18
00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:03.300
OK, so we have our cyclist and starting from rest and going, he's going to reach this certain velocity

19
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.390
here, OK?

20
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.640
So.

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.700
I think that we have enough here.

22
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.260
What are we going to say that the initial position is of the cyclist?

23
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.740
OK, so it's zero meters.

24
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.900
What is this first piece of information tell us, with an average acceleration of zero point five meters

25
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.740
per second squared?

26
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.290
Well, it's telling us that that's the average acceleration.

27
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.890
And the other key clue is telling us that it's meters per second squared.

28
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.210
So where we're being given here, the acceleration.

29
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.440
OK.

30
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.150
How far will the cyclists travel?

31
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.640
So what does that asking us?

32
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.480
If starting from reste.

33
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.490
What it's starting from us telling us.

34
00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.840
Hopefully by now you're saying, hey, no, he's not going fast at all or is as got no speed, he's

35
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.420
at rest.

36
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.090
We know that the initial velocity is zero and he's going to reach seven meters per second.

37
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.740
What is the meter per second telling us?

38
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.630
Well, by now, hopefully you're saying that's the velocity and that is possibly our final velocity.

39
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910
Oh, this is a little squeeze in here.

40
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.260
I apologize about that.

41
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.910
But we have all of our information that we need.

42
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.420
We have our final velocity that we're going to be well, we're going to be looking for our final velocity,

43
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.820
our final position.

44
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.410
And we have a variable that we don't care about.

45
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.830
Doesn't mention anything at all about time, doesn't ask us for time.

46
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.750
That's the variable that we don't care about.

47
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.140
And that's the variable that we'll be looking for when trying to select our kinematics equation.

48
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.900
So once again, are we given any information on our average velocities now?

49
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.270
Right.

50
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.360
So therefore, we know that we're not going to be using formulas one or two.

51
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.230
We know we're going to be using formulas either three, four or five or six.

52
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.820
So the variable that we don't care about is Delta T, so we're going to be looking for Delta T. Right

53
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.120
now.

54
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.500
We got Delta T. right there.

55
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.210
Don't care about this one.

56
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.000
Not going to be using that formula.

57
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.110
What about this over here?

58
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.290
We have got the key right there, so we're not going be using this formula.

59
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.700
Over here.

60
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.890
Have dealt with there and dealt to you, right there were definitely going to be using this formula.

61
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.130
And do we have Delta tea in here?

62
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.950
No.

63
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
OK, so that's going to be our indication.

64
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.260
Now, this is the formal that we're going to be using.

65
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.620
So let's use that.

66
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:43.100
And I'm just going to draw you are pretty well drawn and we're just going to be using our sixth form.

67
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600
OK, so let's do our politicians and we'll go from there.

68
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.640
OK, so zero squared, zero time zero is equal to zero, so we don't care about that subtraction of

69
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.210
zero, that's not going to provide any value whatsoever.

70
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.470
So we have seven squared, which is equal to 49, which is seven times seven.

71
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:19.870
Right.

72
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.600
And then we have this positive two.

73
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.750
Times point five, so that's just equal to one, right?

74
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.960
And so we're just left with access is equal to 49.

75
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.090
And that's their answer.

76
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.850
OK, well, that's simple enough, right?
