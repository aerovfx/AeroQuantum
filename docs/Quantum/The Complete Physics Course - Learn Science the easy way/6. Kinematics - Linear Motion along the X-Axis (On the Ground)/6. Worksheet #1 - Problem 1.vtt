00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.110
OK, so let's get into our first problem, what I want to do when I'm going through these problems well,

2
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.220
I want you to do is to think about what the problem is actually saying.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.350
I don't really care if you're not really paying attention to the numbers the first time you're actually

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.250
going through these problems.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.290
But think about the situation and I'll help you out with going about visualizing that.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.440
The first pump says light from the sun reaches the earth in eight point three minutes, which is equal

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.630
to four hundred ninety eight seconds.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.510
The average velocity of light is three point zero zero times ten to the eight power meters per second.

9
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.190
How far from the earth is the sun now?

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.970
Once again, I just want you to read the question itself again.

11
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.540
But let's not even include the numbers.

12
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.660
Let's just read the words.

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.110
So life from the sun reaches the earth.

14
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.370
In this amount of time, the average velocity of the light is this.

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.550
How far from the earth is the sun?

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.030
OK, so let's think about what's happening here.

17
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.820
So I'm just going to draw a little visual here.

18
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.360
Say it.

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.400
We have the sun over here and we have the earth over here.

20
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.660
What we're basically saying is, hey, no sunlight is going to travel from the sun and reach the earth.

21
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.420
Right.

22
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.490
That's a situation.

23
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.920
We know that it's starting off over here.

24
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.260
That's the initial position.

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.970
And the final position is going to be over here.

26
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.450
So what I'd like to do is this.

27
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.590
I like to pretend, say if we are standing right on the sun, which is hopefully, you know, is physically

28
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.660
impossible, but would be awesome.

29
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.530
OK, so if we're standing right here on the sun.

30
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.690
And we're watching the light all the way over here to the Earth.

31
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.660
Let me ask you this.

32
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.910
What do you think the value is that we're going to be saying?

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.090
Is the initial position of the sunlight?

34
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.670
If it's right here, it's going to go all the way over here.

35
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.150
Initially, it's going to have a value of zero zero meters.

36
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.620
That's the initial position.

37
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.030
So let's go through here and pull out the given information that we have.

38
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.070
It's going to take 498 seconds, which is equal to eight point three minutes.

39
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.400
Hey, which one of these units we want to be using once again, if we're referring to this over here,

40
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.770
we know that time is going to be measured in seconds.

41
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.310
So let's actually just use the 498 seconds.

42
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.130
So we have our Delta team, which is 498 seconds, the average velocity.

43
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.950
Oh, look at that.

44
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.230
All right.

45
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.170
So we are being told that average velocity over here is three point zero zero times ten to the eight

46
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.220
meters per second.

47
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.850
So we also know that's velocity being that we're giving the units and we're being told specifically

48
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.110
that's the average velocity.

49
00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.580
So we know that our variable that we're going to be dealing with is V so three times 10 to the eight

50
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.850
power meters per second.

51
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.550
All right.

52
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.210
And how far from the earth is a sun?

53
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.500
OK, so wait a minute, if we actually know that the initial position is right over here and that the

54
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:27.430
final position is over here, isn't that really just how far away it is that's describing the final

55
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.980
position?

56
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.060
Yeah, right.

57
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.510
So that's actually what we're going to be looking for.

58
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.240
Which one of these kinematic equations do we want to be working with?

59
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.410
Which one will be best suited for our needs?

60
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.020
Well, we know that this velocity here is our average velocity.

61
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.320
So these formulas over here, these first two have to deal with average velocity.

62
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.000
This line separates the formula that have to do with average velocity and all the other ones.

63
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.280
None of these formulas over here have to do with average velocity.

64
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.890
Whenever we're dealing with the average velocity, we're going to be looking at these first two formulas.

65
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.250
So I just want to make that clear.

66
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.730
OK, well, looking at the other variables that we have here, are we giving our final position, initial

67
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.100
position and our Delta T..

68
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:15.450
Well, yeah.

69
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.840
OK, so that's nice.

70
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.780
Well, what about this?

71
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.360
Are we getting our initial velocity, final velocity now?

72
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.730
OK, well that's simple enough.

73
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.290
Let's actually just use this formula right here, so I'm just going to write that out right now.

74
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.060
So we have the is equal to.

75
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.910
That's F minus X I.

76
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.400
Divided by Delta T..

77
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.770
So we just simply plug in our variables right now, so we've XPath, which is the variable that we're

78
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.460
trying to solve.

79
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.820
Oh.

80
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.850
I did not do a good job already, so we have three times 10 to the 8th where I'm just going to do is

81
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.910
exclude our units.

82
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.930
Your teacher might say, hey, know what, I want you to exclude the units when you're plugging in for

83
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:03.950
the equation.

84
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.500
But for myself, I don't mind if you actually do exclude the units.

85
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.810
It just makes it a lot simpler, a lot easier to manage going through these problems.

86
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:23.150
So Zeph, minus our initial position of zero divided by our Delta T., which is 498 and we saw this

87
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.970
out for Zeph and we should be able to get our answer.

88
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.210
I'm just going to delete our picture over here.

89
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.700
So this subtraction of zero does actually add any sort of value to our problem whatsoever now.

90
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.020
Right.

91
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.530
So all that we basically have here is except divide by 498.

92
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.460
How do we actually get rid of a division of 498?

93
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.620
You multiply 490 on both sides of the equation.

94
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.050
When you do that, you should be plugging this in your calculator and getting the final position is

95
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.120
one point four, nine times ten to the eleventh tower.

96
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.660
And that should be in units of meters.

97
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.780
And that's your final answer.
