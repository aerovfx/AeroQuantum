00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:07.260
These last year problems, these are just simply conceptual questions and let's just have a little discussion

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.920
about this.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.060
I'm not going to write any sort of answer for either one of these.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.510
Let's just have a discussion.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.040
So if the velocity of an object is zero, does that mean that the acceleration is zero?

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.390
If the acceleration is zero?

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.670
Does that mean that the velocity zero?

8
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.950
OK, so the way that I look at these types of problems is just take it step by step.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.590
Let's actually just look at this if the velocity of the object is zero.

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.360
OK, so let's think about this.

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.530
We have a car right here.

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.130
If the velocity of the object is zero.

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.680
Well, wait a minute.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.400
Is the car moving right now?

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.580
Oh, for yourself.

16
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.590
Say to yourself, no, it's not moving.

17
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.300
Does it mean that acceleration is zero?

18
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.870
Well, if the car's not moving, how could it possibly be accelerating?

19
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.330
So, yeah, it does mean that acceleration is zero if the object is simply not moving.

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.090
OK, so that's our.

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:16.680
If the acceleration is zero, does that mean the velocity zero, OK, this.

22
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.890
We have to think about what is acceleration is an acceleration, the change of velocity over a certain

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.840
amount of time.

24
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.780
OK, so if acceleration is zero, does that mean that the velocity zero?

25
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.760
Well, if this car is just trucking along to de de de de de de de de de de de.

26
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.280
Would you say that this car is accelerating right now if it is moving like this?

27
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.850
I wouldn't I would say that's going at a constant velocity.

28
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.450
If it has a constant velocity, what's the acceleration?

29
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:06.300
If the objects velocity is constant, if it's steady pace, then the acceleration is zero.

30
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.980
OK, so there you go.

31
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.580
How about this next one?

32
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.870
A car advertised is advertised to go from zero to 60 miles an hour in six seconds.

33
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.390
What does this say about the car?

34
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.000
Does it mean that the is fast or does it mean that it can accelerate?

35
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.390
Well.

36
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.010
Once again, acceleration talks about the change in velocity, being able to go from zero miles an hour

37
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.180
to 60 miles an hour and the time span of six seconds, it's telling you, hey, you know what?

38
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.130
This car has a really good acceleration.
