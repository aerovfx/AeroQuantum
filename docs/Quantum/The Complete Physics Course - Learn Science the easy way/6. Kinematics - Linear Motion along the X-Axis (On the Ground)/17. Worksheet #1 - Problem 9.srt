1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,610
OK, so let's get into problem number nine, so number nine says when Maggie apply the brakes of her

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:14,240
car, the car slows uniformly from 15 meters per second to zero meters per second in 2.5 seconds.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,150
How many meters before a stop sign Mushi apply her brakes.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,370
OK, well, what's happening here?

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,150
Kind of sounds like that Maggie is driving in our car and she's slowing down to a stop sign that she's

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,560
coming to a complete stop.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,590
That's what the zero meters per second is telling us right now.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,960
So let's pull out some given information.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,980
What do you think that her initial position is going to be?

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,080
Hey, it doesn't really tell us anything specific.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,330
So we're just going to go ahead and say it's zero

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,110
slows uniformly from this.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,560
Velocity down to this velocity, we know its velocity because it says meters per second.

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,770
So what is this, 15 meters per second actually representing?

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,670
Is that the initial velocity or final velocity?

16
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,860
And what she's uniformly slowing down from 15 meters per second to zero meters per second.

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,920
Hopefully you're saying yourself that that's her initial velocity, the 15 and that the zero is her

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,090
final velocity.

19
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,570
And we have two point five seconds, that's the time span that she's doing and how many meters before

20
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,970
steps on Mushie apply her brakes.

21
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,310
OK, so it sounds like that we're really just looking for the distance or the the final position.

22
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:29,670
Right.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,630
OK, so the there's no mention of acceleration and it's not asking us for the acceleration, so that's

24
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,950
going to be the variable that we don't care about and that's the one that we're going to be using to

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,360
determine our equation.

26
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,770
So once again, how are we dealing with the average velocity now?

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,070
Right.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,360
So we're not going to be using that one.

29
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,680
Let's come through here and actually just pick out all the ones that do have the acceleration.

30
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,830
We do see right here we have acceleration, not going to use this one or by this formula.

31
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,360
I don't see acceleration in there.

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,650
OK, what about this one?

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,100
Yeah, we got acceleration right there, OK.

34
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,010
And what about this formula?

35
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,690
We got acceleration right there.

36
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,760
So we're not going to be using this one.

37
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,690
All right.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,140
So it looks like that we're going to be using Formula number four for this problem.

39
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,440
So let's go through this math.

40
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,660
And once again, just make sure that you wrote the center correctly, and I think that we're looking

41
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,030
good.

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,340
OK, so always once again, make sure that you verify that you were done correctly.

43
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,180
Oh, look at this.

44
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,720
I like this.

45
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,270
So we have Zeph over here.

46
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,380
We have Zeph over here.

47
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,710
All we're going to have to do is plug this into the calculator and we get our answer.

48
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,210
I love those promises are just super simple.

49
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,130
All right.

50
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,930
So here we go.

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,210
Let's do this at zero plus one.

52
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,400
Our initial velocity and final velocity and.

53
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,800
Times are 2.5 seconds.

54
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,740
OK.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,460
Ah, this doesn't provide any value, this doesn't provide any value.

56
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,850
So all we're left with is one half of 15 times 2.5.

57
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,800
OK.

58
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,420
He played on the calculator once again.

59
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,820
This is one 1/2 times 15 times 2.5.

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:33,230
And when plug in the calculator and we will get our answer so we get XPath is equal to.

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,760
Eighteen point seven, five meters.

62
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,340
Right, and that's the problem.

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:42,750
Janine.
