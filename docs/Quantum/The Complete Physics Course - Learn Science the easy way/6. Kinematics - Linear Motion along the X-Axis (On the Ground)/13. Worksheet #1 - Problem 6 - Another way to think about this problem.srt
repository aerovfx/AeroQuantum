1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
Is there another way that we could think about during this problem?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,690
Now let's keep in mind the definition of acceleration.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,690
Acceleration is the change in velocity over a certain amount of time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So the acceleration of two meters per second squared is equal to the change in velocity over a certain

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,140
amount of time for every one second.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,140
The velocity changes by two meters per second.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,490
That's what acceleration is.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,090
It's a change in velocity over a certain time.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,030
So let me ask you this now.

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:38,990
Once again, we keep keep in mind that the initial velocity here is 20 meters per second.

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,270
So at zero seconds, what's the velocity?

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,060
20 metres a second, right after one second.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,690
What's the new velocity, keeping in mind this definition for every one second, the velocity changes

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,170
by two meters per second, which is what acceleration is.

15
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,260
So after one second, what's the new velocity?

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,110
22 meters per second.

17
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,070
Well, what about after two seconds?

18
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:08,860
Three.

19
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,860
Hopefully you're seeing a pattern right now.

20
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,850
And once again, we get our answer of 30 meters per second as our final velocity.

21
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,600
Hey, so that's by definition, that's what that means.

22
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,010
That's what acceleration is.

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,670
OK, well, we solved it.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,930
And that's that's why this is a this is interesting.

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,750
So what about another way?

26
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,310
Look at this formula right here.

27
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,330
Have you seen a formula kind of similar to this?

28
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,300
Well, what we do here is this.

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,930
I'm just going to rearrange these two terms right now.

30
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,580
Let me just rewrite this.

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,340
Just like this.

32
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,390
Have you ever seen any formulas, any equations looking like this?

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,810
Well, yeah, you have.

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,930
Have you seen this equation before?

35
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:12,170
This is the slope intercept formula where the arm represents the slope.

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,620
And the BEA represents the Y intercept.

37
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,810
And I'm sure by now that you've actually seen this formal before.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,970
OK, well, let's do this.

39
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,160
What's the value of B?

40
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,400
Well, that's the initial blast velocity, which is our 20 meters per second.

41
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,880
So let's say here, this is our 20 meters a second.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,770
How do we go about plotting this on a graph?

43
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:49,710
So we have our VEF is equal to our slope or our acceleration times our Delta T, that's going to be

44
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,300
our input variable plus our B, which is twenty.

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,090
OK, so what is slope.

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,230
It's rise over run.

47
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:58,670
Right.

48
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,340
So we rise to and go over one.

49
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,920
Rise to over one rise to over one rise to go over one dam when we get our line.

50
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,620
So, hey, you know what?

51
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,870
This is just an alternative method, but once again, rise to go over one that's at 20, rise to go

52
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,900
over one, 24, rise to go over one.

53
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:30,660
And that's twenty six, twenty eight all the way up until 30 where the time is equal to one second,

54
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,150
two seconds, three seconds, four seconds and five seconds.

55
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:44,130
Notice once again we have at five seconds our velocity is equal to 30 meters per second.
