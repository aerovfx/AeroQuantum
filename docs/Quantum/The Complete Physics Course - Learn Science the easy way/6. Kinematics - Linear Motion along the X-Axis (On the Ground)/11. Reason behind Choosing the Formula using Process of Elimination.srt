1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,990
So in the last video, we went through the problem and we pulled out this given information and then

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,770
we basically said, hey, and what Delta t the time elapsed.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,770
This is the variable that we don't care about.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,420
It didn't ask about this and it didn't actually give this to us in the given problem.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,630
So what do we do?

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,870
We came over here to these formulas down over here.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,840
We exclude these ones because it didn't have anything to do with average velocity.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,140
I basically said what we're gonna do is scan through these formulas, look for our Delta teams and basically

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,670
say to ourselves, we're not going to be using these formulas that have the Delta T involved.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,250
And this is what we did.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,740
Right.

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,700
So what was the reason why we did this?

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,020
Why did we do this?

14
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:50,400
Now, I'm just getting a little sidestep over here for a quick second and show you this.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,420
I'm going to give you the instruction to solve for X in these two equations.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,530
OK, so once again, we do have to two terms over here.

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,060
We have the five X plus two.

18
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,940
Once again, terms are separated by plus and minus signs.

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,130
How do we go about Iceland X?

20
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,340
Well, first, let's get rid of this term over here of plus two.

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,830
How do we get rid of a plus two?

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,980
Let's subtract two on each side of the equation, 17 minus two, which gives us 15 and that's equal

23
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,130
to five X.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,440
Now what we have is a five being multiplied by X.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,730
How do we get rid of a multiplication of five?

26
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:35,310
We divide both sides by five and we simply get three is equal to X and we will get value for our X.

27
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,740
Now let's do this.

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,850
I'm just going to do the same thing here.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,710
Now, let's get a value for X.

30
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:55,480
Well, wait a minute, I could solve for X, but will this result in a value for X?

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,980
Hmm, I don't think so.

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,440
All right.

33
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,430
Because now we have the two terms here, once again, separated by the plus.

34
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,830
And my one we we could subtract to Y on both sides of the equation.

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,780
And then divide by our five oh.

36
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,220
And this is what's equal to X.

37
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,290
Wait a minute, so if we have here our two unknown's.

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,000
Will we be able to get a value for X no, right, because there's two unknowns here.

39
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,050
Hey, wait a minute.

40
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:38,160
So this is the reason why we were crossing out our delta tears because we have an unknown right here

41
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,620
and we have an unknown right here.

42
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:46,830
And if I want to solve for this and I don't know this value where I be able to get a value now.

43
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,840
So let's come through here once again.

44
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:58,680
I want to sell for this Vieth, this equation here, it has to be both, but it also has Delta T and

45
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,170
that's the reason why Beesly said, hey, let's cancel this one out of this equation over here.

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,600
Well, wait a minute.

47
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,660
It doesn't even have a V.

48
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,610
So how would I be able to go about getting a valid value for VIth?

49
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,510
I wouldn't be able to.

50
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,350
Obviously this one over here, it's got Veth.

51
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,180
And it doesn't have a Delta T Oh, wait a minute, that's the equation that we did use.

52
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:29,250
OK, so this one over here, it's got a V and a Delta T, we can't get a value once again because it

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,550
simply has the Delta T, we're going across that R Delta T is over here and these are the, the formulas

54
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,500
that we can't use this one up here.

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,940
It doesn't have a Delta t it's got to be if we could solve this and get a value and that's the process

56
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,150
and that's the reason why that why we do that.
