1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,510
Here are our kinematic equations, as well as these position velocity, acceleration and time elapsed

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,300
quantities.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,000
So write these down, it will help you and just understand this.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,090
So for position, it's measured in meters, velocity, meters per second, acceleration meters per second

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,800
squared and time elapsed is in seconds.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,570
OK, so the thing that I really want to point out is, hey, know, maybe your teacher doesn't explain

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:38,880
it exactly like this using XY, VI and V, maybe your teacher actually uses X not and X F or does simply

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,030
X not and X or Y.

9
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,790
Oh no, I've never really seen this, but maybe your teacher actually says x1 and x2.

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:56,850
Either way, what these represent is an initial position and a final position and however they want

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,470
to go back, describing the subscripts is up to them and it's completely fine.

12
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,970
There's no like it really should be a little bit more standardized, but it isn't and possibly even

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,680
for average velocity.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,030
Maybe your teacher right.

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,160
Writes it out like this really to explicitly defined the idea that that's the average velocity.

16
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,800
But either one of these two is correct.

17
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,750
Same thing with acceleration, maybe instead of Delta T, maybe they should prefer.

18
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,900
Hey, and what let's explicitly say that's our final minus our initial and maybe they actually don't

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:38,610
use the final initial, maybe the use just T and T not which is this over here that's pronounced not

20
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,980
and I believe that's spelt KNST.

21
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,360
Yes.

22
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,290
So these just represent hand what it's initial.

23
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,340
It's the final.

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,920
And you know, I didn't actually describe before.

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,690
Maybe they don't have your teacher doesn't even have the kinematic equation written like this.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,240
Maybe they actually haven't written like this.

27
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,620
And this delta just represents a change, the change in a position over the change in time.

28
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,990
So your teacher might be describing it like this.

29
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,100
But, Anderson, that's just simply that it's the final position minus the initial position.

30
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,770
So do me a favor.

31
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,730
Don't push in the comments saying, hey, you know what, you're wrong.

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,410
These aren't how they should be.

33
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,110
My teacher teaches it this way.

34
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,970
It's really just a matter of preference on how the teacher actually goes about explaining this is the

35
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:31,840
way that I'm going to do it.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,070
I'm going to consistently use this notation here.

37
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,690
So this is the way I'm going to be describing it.

38
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,560
If you want to use the way that your teacher is doing it, that's completely fine.

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,290
But I just want to have that explained to you.
