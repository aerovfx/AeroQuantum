1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,260
For this next one, we have a bus.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,540
It's traveling at 20 meters per second, which is equivalent to 45 miles an hour, and it speeds up

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,810
at a constant rate of two meters per second squared.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,580
What velocity does it reach?

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,020
Five seconds later.

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,150
OK, so what do we have here?

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:26,730
We have a bus and it's traveling at this speed and it's speeding up at two meters per second squared.

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,620
What velocity doesn't reach?

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,410
OK, so describe to me what the bus is doing.

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,380
It's going fast and it's going faster.

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,860
Right.

12
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,570
So once again, what do you think that the initial position is that of the bus?

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,690
What are we going to say it is if it's not told to us or does it always going to say it's equal to zero

14
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,250
meters?

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,700
What else do we have here?

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,350
What is this?

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,790
So a bus is traveling at this, what does that 20 meters per second telling us?

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,960
What's the velocity?

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,320
Right.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,140
And it's traveling at that currently.

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,650
Oh, so that must be our initial velocity.

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,840
You might be saying to yourself, well, doesn't a bus always start from rest and then it gets up to

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,790
a certain speed and then it goes faster?

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:21,950
Well, OK, but if we're looking at this as a system right now and we're basically just initially observing

25
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,500
the bus to be moving at this speed, that's what we're going to say, is the initial velocity.

26
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,190
And what is this, two meters per second squared telling us, what is that?

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,830
Well, if it's meters per second squared, that's a good indicator that that's the acceleration.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,160
OK.

29
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,690
Oh, we have five seconds here.

30
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,570
Simple enough, what does that tell us?

31
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,250
That's the time the time elapsed.

32
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,340
Oh.

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,880
And what is it that we're trying to find here, what velocity does it reach?

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,580
It sounds like we're trying to find out what the final velocity is.

35
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:09,020
Does it say anything about the final position or are we trying to solve for the final position at all?

36
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:09,780
No.

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,140
Right.

38
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,560
OK, so that's going to be the variable that we don't care about.

39
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,460
So what we're going to do here is, first of all, are we dealing with a average velocity?

40
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,370
No, right.

41
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,510
It doesn't say anything about average velocity.

42
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,410
As a matter of fact, we know that the velocity is changing.

43
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,490
We know that we're accelerating over here.

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,480
We're not dealing with an average velocity at all.

45
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,590
Let's look at this right now.

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,740
We are trying to find the foremost that have the final position in it and we're going to say we don't

47
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,240
care about it.

48
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,860
Does this one have final position in it?

49
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:42,740
No.

50
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,180
Oh, OK.

51
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,100
What about this one yet?

52
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,030
Not right off the bat.

53
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,280
We got final position right there.

54
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,250
We don't care about this formula or about this formula.

55
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,860
Oh, yeah.

56
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,190
Yep.

57
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,060
Right there.

58
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:53,810
I see it.

59
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,640
And what about this one?

60
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,550
Oh, yeah, we got final position right there and we don't care about that one.

61
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,040
The very first formula that we actually were considering using, that's the formula that that we will

62
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,430
use.

63
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:18,030
So we have our Veth is equal to our V.I. Plus our acceleration times the Delta T now the de'ath that's

64
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:26,760
the variable that we're trying to find is equal to the V.I. plus acceleration of two times five.

65
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,090
OK.

66
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,370
Oh this is simple enough.

67
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,070
Look at this.

68
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,410
We could probably just do this in our heads.

69
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,390
And looking at that, we correctly solved this problem.
