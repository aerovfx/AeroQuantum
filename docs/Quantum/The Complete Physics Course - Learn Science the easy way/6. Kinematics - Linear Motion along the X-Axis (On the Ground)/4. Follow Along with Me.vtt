00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.400
Notice I did provide all the formulas up on top for you.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.600
So we're going to be going through these problems.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.330
And don't worry, I actually do have another worksheet where you could actually be practicing problems

4
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.850
on your own.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.580
I just want to go through this with you, though, because I think that these problems are complex enough

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.320
in order for us to feel a lot better about this if we were to go through these problems together.
