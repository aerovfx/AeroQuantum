1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,040
All right, so let's go through this next problem, so a dragster starting from rust accelerates at

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,680
one point five meters per second squared.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,050
How fast is it going when it has traveled 25 meters?

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,140
OK, so let's look at this here.

5
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,380
Let's picture this.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,210
We have our car.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,720
It is starting right here.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,590
It is starting here from rest and it accelerates to one point five meters per second squared.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,700
OK, so it's going to be starting over here and it's going to go this much.

10
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,230
How fast is it going when it has traveled 25 meters?

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,780
OK, so that's the situation.

12
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:43,240
Let's start to plug in what we know.

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,250
If it's starting right here, what are we going to say?

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,450
That initial position is, hey, this is getting a lot more common, right?

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,930
We're going to see this a lot unless it really specifies what the initial position is.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,820
OK, and what's the final position?

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,310
Well, we know it has traveled 25 meters.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,220
OK, so good indicator to us that that's our final position.

19
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,720
All right, and what does this one point, five meters per second squared telling us?

20
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,010
Well, just right off the bat, being that we see the units of meters per second squared, we know that

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,410
it's our acceleration, never mind it are telling us that it's saying that's accelerating at this value.

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,050
So what's this right at that?

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,120
And one point five meters per second squared.

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,030
OK, this is another key word right here, if it's starting from rest, hey, if it's some from just

25
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,430
how fast is it initially going?

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:47,650
OK, and what is the problem, asking us for how fast is going when it has traveled this much?

27
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,600
OK, so how fast is it going?

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,620
Well, that's our final velocity.

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,140
That's what we're being asked for.

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,770
And do we care about our time?

31
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,220
Does it tell us anything about time now?

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,640
Do we care about time?

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,820
Is it asking us for time now?

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,650
OK, so that's the thing that we don't care about.

35
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,440
All right, so we don't care about time.

36
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,990
Well, OK, so are we dealing with it average velocity now, right?

37
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,870
It said nothing about average velocity.

38
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,780
We're not trying to solve for average velocity.

39
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,900
So we know right off the bat that we're going to be dealing with these four formulas down here.

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,460
Once again, we don't care about time.

41
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,730
So wherever we see time, we're just going to say, hey, I don't care about time.

42
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,710
We're not using that formula.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,210
What about this one time?

44
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,890
OK.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,960
Oh, there it is.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,490
Right.

47
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,640
I don't care about this formula.

48
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,270
What about this one?

49
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,180
Oh, we got time here on what?

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,180
We also have time here.

51
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:53,110
We're definitely not using this formula that we're going to be using the last one to we see time.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,500
Nope.

53
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,300
Good indicator to us that we're going to be using Formula Number six in order to solve this problem.

54
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:08,100
So let's ride that out right now, so we have VEF squared is equal to minus X I.

55
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,780
And always, always, always double check to see that you actually wrote in the formula, correct?

56
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:25,300
OK, so I believe I remember writing that incorrectly, that would be an awful mistake to make and I've

57
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,070
seen students actually do that where they forget, hey, and it's very easy to forget Square, it's

58
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,730
over here.

59
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,350
Or instead of writing to my son, I've seen people actually write a plus sign in here.

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,910
Maybe they'll write a minus to a over here.

61
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,710
Either way, make sure that you write the formula correct, because it would just be such a silly mistake

62
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,420
to get the problem wrong because he wrote the formula wrong.

63
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:49,840
All right.

64
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,610
So let's see your substitution now.

65
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,220
What do we have the is what we're trying to find.

66
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,200
So we're just going to drop this down.

67
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,450
V.I. squared, OK, so we have zero and we're going to square that number.

68
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,670
We know that zero times any number is equal to zero.

69
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,460
So that's not going to do anything for us.

70
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,550
So we have two times our acceleration, minus zero.

71
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,570
OK, and let's just continue to solve this out.

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,850
Provides no value.

73
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,410
That provides no value.

74
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,460
Essentially, that's what we're doing, right?

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,650
All right, great.

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,650
So we have the squared is equal to 75 and what I want the velocity.

77
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,970
I don't care what the F squared is equal to.

78
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,530
So how do we get rid of the squared?

79
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,090
We take the square root.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,130
And that will get us our final answer of eight point six meters per second.
