00:00.130 --> 00:03.360
OK so our universe is made up of atoms.

00:03.390 --> 00:03.620
OK.

00:03.660 --> 00:04.520
So let's have a look at.

00:04.530 --> 00:08.770
So all atoms are made up of kind of three different kind of parts.

00:08.870 --> 00:14.100
We have positive charges and the positive charges are usually in the nucleus.

00:14.130 --> 00:16.350
That's kind of the center of the atoms.

00:16.380 --> 00:16.590
OK.

00:16.600 --> 00:22.580
And they're surrounded by these tiny little electrons and you can think of it as a cloud of electrons

00:22.730 --> 00:23.290
OK.

00:23.370 --> 00:29.160
If you want to consider as a point particle kind of circulating in some orbit that's also OK for now

00:29.820 --> 00:31.040
but it's more of a cloud.

00:31.040 --> 00:36.860
There's a kind of a probability distribution that electrons are somewhere in space.

00:36.920 --> 00:37.170
OK.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.020
So we have electrons protons and we also have neutrons.

00:42.140 --> 00:42.390
OK.

00:42.420 --> 00:48.720
So one thing that we're going to see a lot here is that the charge OK the charge of these tiny little

00:48.720 --> 00:52.910
guys Well for now we're just going to say that the protons are going to be positive.

00:52.950 --> 00:55.970
We'll see a little bit later what they're charged charges it's actually written down here.

00:55.980 --> 00:59.790
But in the charge of electrons are negative.

00:59.850 --> 01:00.610
OK.

01:00.660 --> 01:05.120
And neutrons have zero charge OK.

01:05.390 --> 01:09.220
So these are the basic constituents of atoms.

01:09.230 --> 01:15.440
Actually if you have a look at the size of atoms if this kind of black line here represents a 1 Angstrom.

01:15.490 --> 01:15.670
OK.

01:15.680 --> 01:21.420
If you remember what an angstrom is is ten to the negative 10 meters.

01:21.430 --> 01:21.680
OK.

01:21.680 --> 01:29.480
That is one Angstrom it's a way way smaller right the center of a helium atom is kind of this little

01:29.480 --> 01:32.450
pink and purple dot down over here.

01:32.450 --> 01:36.860
And this is actually to the size you're going to right a size down.

01:36.950 --> 01:39.490
It would be at the Fermi meter.

01:39.500 --> 01:47.300
OK Fermi meter effect is actually a fem dough meter I'm sorry a phantom meter is ten to the negative

01:47.300 --> 01:49.050
15 meters.

01:49.070 --> 01:49.470
OK.

01:49.580 --> 01:51.890
So they are really really small.

01:51.950 --> 01:52.150
OK.

01:52.220 --> 01:54.620
So you could see kind of zooming in here that the nucleus.

01:54.620 --> 01:57.110
This is an example of a helium atom.

01:57.170 --> 02:03.020
So we actually would have two protons This is more of the pink center over here and the black kind of

02:03.020 --> 02:04.300
cloud around it.

02:04.340 --> 02:12.450
These would represent it's two electrons so they are very very far away from the center right relative

02:12.450 --> 02:14.500
to the size of the nucleus right.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.650
They could actually be very very far away.
