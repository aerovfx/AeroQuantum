00:00.110 --> 00:06.930
Take a look at the solutions here for the quiz number one first question says if two objects are electrically

00:06.930 --> 00:09.820
attracted to each other okay.

00:09.960 --> 00:14.630
Then there have some choices over here both objects must be negatively charged.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.710
Well let's have a look at two things that are negatively charged to objects.

00:19.710 --> 00:20.820
No that won't work right.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.230
These are not attracted to each other.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.050
These would have a force that would be repulsive.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.700
So actually this one is wrong.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.360
Both objects must be positively charged.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.340
Again that's kind of the same thing right.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.370
These are both positively charged.

00:35.370 --> 00:37.360
They would be repelled by each other.

00:37.390 --> 00:39.840
So so that one there also doesn't work.

00:39.840 --> 00:40.140
All right.

00:40.140 --> 00:42.280
Clean that up a little bit.

00:42.330 --> 00:49.310
Next one object must be negatively charged and the other must be positively charge.

00:49.470 --> 00:50.490
Let's draw that one.

00:50.500 --> 00:52.410
So this one's negatively charged.

00:52.410 --> 00:54.180
This one's positively charged.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.230
Well that one would kind of work.

00:56.370 --> 01:01.960
The only thing that I don't really like about this one here is that it says it must.

01:02.040 --> 01:02.890
OK.

01:03.270 --> 01:05.520
Sometimes you have to be careful with these words.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.520
So let's have a look at the next one.

01:07.590 --> 01:15.120
The object could be I kind of prefer words like could and let's go see why it could be electrically

01:15.120 --> 01:15.930
neutral.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.110
However it says neutral over there.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.490
So this one's actually a little bit of a tricky problem.

01:20.490 --> 01:23.520
Let me show you kind of two neutral objects right.

01:23.910 --> 01:30.270
So one of them is like this and positive and negative and this one is positive and negative.

01:30.270 --> 01:36.300
Well if you look at all the interactions that we would have there would be an interaction between the

01:36.300 --> 01:39.840
positive and the negative here that would be attractive.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.130
There would be a repulsive force between the two positives and then you could do the same thing with

01:44.130 --> 01:45.500
the negative right.

01:45.510 --> 01:49.650
So you might say that those cancel out and you'd probably be true.

01:49.650 --> 01:55.140
However there is another way you can draw these neutral objects I imagine I have a neutral object that

01:55.140 --> 01:56.500
looks like this.

01:56.520 --> 02:01.800
What if it's more positively charged on one side of the object versus the other.

02:01.800 --> 02:02.410
Right.

02:02.430 --> 02:06.390
And over on this side I have the same thing.

02:06.390 --> 02:06.930
All right.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.500
And I've shown you how to create objects like this.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.040
Right.

02:11.040 --> 02:18.720
What if I bring a rod over here that is negatively charged what it's going to do is it's going to push

02:19.530 --> 02:21.890
the negative charges on one side.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.680
All right.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.770
But what is the interaction here between this guy and this guy.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.900
Both of these are neutral.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.600
They're not touching each other.

02:28.680 --> 02:33.270
However these guys would be attractive because you could see that the positive and the negative here

02:33.600 --> 02:36.160
are closer together.

02:36.180 --> 02:36.660
Right.

02:36.660 --> 02:43.410
Although these we have some repulsion between these positives and these positives they're farther apart.

02:43.660 --> 02:51.970
So the net force here is actually attractive so actually the best answer is actually this one over here

02:51.970 --> 02:53.030
choice D.

02:53.170 --> 02:55.830
The little bit of a tricky one you might have said See.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.490
However it's not always the case.

02:57.510 --> 02:57.720
OK.

02:57.730 --> 03:00.850
Because here you can have two neutral objects that attract each other.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.490
All right let's go do problem to let me scroll down over here so we can see the full question.

03:06.550 --> 03:13.720
Problem 2 says we have these diagrams here it says X and Y are two uncharged spherical spheres.

03:13.810 --> 03:15.190
OK.

03:15.250 --> 03:18.520
On insulating stands and there are in contact with each other.

03:18.550 --> 03:18.740
OK.

03:18.750 --> 03:20.090
So that's also important.

03:20.110 --> 03:27.280
That means that electrons can go from x to y positively charged right over here is brought closer to

03:27.280 --> 03:31.450
X is shown sphere Y is then moved the way.

03:31.450 --> 03:34.810
What is the final charge of both X and Y.

03:34.810 --> 03:37.210
All right well let's think about electrons again.

03:37.270 --> 03:39.660
Electrons are the things that are going to move.

03:39.670 --> 03:45.210
So imagine here we have certain number of electrons electrons are going to be attracted to this rod.

03:45.250 --> 03:45.930
Right.

03:45.970 --> 03:50.550
So there's going to be more electrons that are going to move from Y since it's in contact over here

03:50.560 --> 03:53.320
it means the electrons can move to this side.

03:53.350 --> 03:57.320
So what does that leave charge on the sphere wide.

03:57.330 --> 04:03.070
That means overall it's going to be positively charged because the electrons are going to move over

04:03.520 --> 04:04.780
electrons move this way

04:08.460 --> 04:08.800
OK.

04:08.840 --> 04:11.830
So what does that mean then after you remove everything and you split him up.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.980
So once you split them up the charges are stuck.

04:14.990 --> 04:17.300
They can't fly off the sphere.

04:17.300 --> 04:22.190
So what you're doing here is you're going to be leaving the system kind of like this positively charged

04:22.190 --> 04:24.970
object and negatively charged object.

04:24.980 --> 04:25.270
All right.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.800
So both X and Y are neutral.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.520
No that's not going to happen.

04:29.720 --> 04:30.980
X is positive.

04:30.980 --> 04:34.220
No we said X is going to be negative x is neutral.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.070
Nope.

04:35.210 --> 04:38.870
Again the best answer is D is the best answer right.

04:38.870 --> 04:41.460
X is negative y is positive.

04:41.610 --> 04:41.960
All right.

04:42.050 --> 04:44.150
So kind of a good little problem there.

04:44.170 --> 04:45.900
Let's go to problem three.

04:45.910 --> 04:46.820
Me scroll down.

04:48.140 --> 04:52.360
Our problem three says two on charge spheres again.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.340
Well let's go ahead and draw them.

04:54.550 --> 04:59.450
This will be sphere 1 and Sphere 2.

04:59.610 --> 05:04.890
OK third metal sphere carrying a positive charge is then placed.

05:04.920 --> 05:05.120
All right.

05:05.130 --> 05:11.220
So let's place sphere 3 is always a good idea to draw a little sketch of what's going on.

05:11.280 --> 05:16.410
This one is positively charged OK it's placed closer to 2.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.410
Now a copper wire is momentarily connected.

05:19.440 --> 05:19.760
OK.

05:19.800 --> 05:25.620
So we're going to put a conducting path over here between the two and it's then removed.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.770
Finally sphere three is removed.

05:28.780 --> 05:31.380
Well let's see what happens to these electrons again.

05:31.440 --> 05:35.260
They're probably neutral and initially they're uncharged.

05:35.260 --> 05:37.620
And once I bring this positive over here what happens.

05:37.620 --> 05:44.280
Well it's going to attract some of the electrons the electrons from sphere number one are going to move

05:44.280 --> 05:50.520
this way at the end that's going to leave this guy here positively charged because it lost some electrons

05:50.820 --> 05:54.000
the electrons want to go over here and then what do you do.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.700
Well then you remove the conducting wire so you're left with some charges over here.

05:59.820 --> 06:03.220
So once you remove the wire again the charges cannot move anymore.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.210
So let's have a look what our choices are.

06:06.210 --> 06:07.380
They're still in charge.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.490
No.

06:08.730 --> 06:13.130
Sphere one carries a positive charge and sphere to a negative charge.

06:13.130 --> 06:16.290
I like that one the other ones are kind of the opposite.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.510
Nope and no one no.

06:18.510 --> 06:18.950
All right.

06:18.990 --> 06:21.810
So B is actually the best answer for this one.

06:21.810 --> 06:26.010
All right now let's look at our final one says a negatively charged Rod this time to be a little bit

06:26.010 --> 06:30.150
careful as brought close to but does not touch.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.820
OK two neutral spheres that are in contact.

06:32.820 --> 06:39.510
So it's kind of like question two that the spheres are in contact but they're insulated from the ground.

06:39.570 --> 06:41.460
If the two spheres are then separated.

06:41.610 --> 06:41.910
All right.

06:41.940 --> 06:44.010
So again it's kind of let's just draw it out.

06:44.010 --> 06:50.860
Sphere one sphere two initially in contact and then then I burn my rod which is negatively charged.

06:51.890 --> 06:56.900
Well let's think about what happens to the electrons when there's a negatively charged object over here

06:56.910 --> 06:58.890
electrons want to go this way.

06:59.070 --> 06:59.600
Right.

06:59.670 --> 07:03.100
And you're gonna be left with a net positive charge over here.

07:03.100 --> 07:08.530
And once you separate them this is going to stay fixed like this.

07:08.870 --> 07:09.100
All right.

07:09.120 --> 07:13.980
If the two spheres are then separated what kind of charge will be on the spheres.

07:13.980 --> 07:14.270
All right.

07:14.270 --> 07:19.110
The sphere near the rod becomes positive and the other sphere becomes negative.

07:19.110 --> 07:19.310
Yeah.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.630
This is what we have right.

07:20.820 --> 07:21.990
This guy here is positive.

07:22.020 --> 07:22.990
That's near the rod.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.000
And this one's negative.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.710
So I kind of like that choice already.

07:25.710 --> 07:27.280
Let's look at the other ones.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.140
Let's be is the exact opposite of a.

07:30.290 --> 07:32.830
And this we know the objects will become charged.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.610
OK so a is the best answer for that one.

07:35.730 --> 07:41.910
All right hopefully you kind of understand this charging process when you make objects in contact and

07:41.910 --> 07:42.930
then you remove them.

07:43.080 --> 07:43.340
OK.

07:43.350 --> 07:49.260
This charge is going to stay fixed on them and you can charge objects simply by bringing other objects

07:49.260 --> 07:52.640
like rods or other charge spheres close to them.
