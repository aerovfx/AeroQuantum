# Charging Objects  - Triboelectric Series

## 01. Introduction

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. The next thing you want to talk about is actually charging objects because we know if we could put điện tích on objects then they're going to be các lực acting between them. Vậy what if I wanted to điện tích my coffee mug. What if I wanted to điện tích this aluminum can. Được rồi. There is something called the Tribal electric series. Được. And I've got a list of elements over here of different materials on this tribal electric series. We'll come back to this in a minute. The first thing I really want you to understand that when you have any object and you want to điện tích it the only thing that you're moving are the electrons. Được. Take this aluminum can ví dụ if I wanted to điện tích it I can either add electrons to it or I can remove some of the electrons that are kind of free that are not tightly bound to the nucleus. The protons and neutrons Do not move for that to happen I would have to break off a piece. Được it's really only the electrons that either get added or they get taken away from objects and that's how you can điện tích them. Được rồi. If I would add electrons to this can somehow. Then it would become negatively charged if I would remove some of the electrons that are on the outside of the aluminum nucleus. What I would do then is I would make it positively charged because I've removed some electrons. OK. Bây giờ the tribal electric series tells us which materials tend to lose electrons easily and which materials tend to gain electrons easily Vậy let's have a little look at some of these. Vậy let's have a look at the rabbit fur the rabbit fur is near the top. OK. And near the top. And I've kind of listed it over here which means it loses electrons really easily. OK. This guy loses electrons very very easily. And what I have here is a piece of rabbit pelt rabbit fur and it's been dyed blue. But that's OK. It's still rabbit pelts Vậy this is a material that tends to lose its electrons very easily and it will lose them when you rub it against something. Vậy what we want to do Bây giờ. Imagine if I wanted to negatively điện tích an object. OK. Vậy here's my object. I'm gonna have a pipe and here's my rabbit pelt. OK. What I want to do this guy here will lose electrons. Vậy I want to end up having a whole bunch of electrons added electrons on this rod over here. Được I imagine here chúng ta có a rod or a pipe. Let me show you the pipe that I'm going to use. Ideally what you want to do is you want to have a pipe that gains electrons or accepts electrons very very easily. OK. And what I have here is a PDC pipe. This is used in kind of plumbing Đúng. And this object actually if I go down this tribal electric series over here the further I go down the more it's easily for that object to gain electrons. OK. That's what chúng ta có here. Game electrons actually PDC pipe is not here but it actually falls Đúng over here. This is PDC pipe poly vinyl chloride. OK. That's this material over here. And it gains electrons very easily. Vậy imagine Bây giờ if I take my rabbit Pelt and I rub it Đúng. Rabbit pelt loses electrons. And you rub it against the PDC pipe that's it. Give it a few strokes like this. And Bây giờ what I have here is a piece of pipe that is negatively charged. You can actually hear it when you rub it. You can hear the electrons actually jumping across or going onto the pipe this is negatively charged. Được rồi. How do I prove that to you that it's negatively charged. Well let's do a little experiment. Vậy for this first experiment here I have the aluminum can which is basically neutral Đúng Bây giờ. There's maybe a little bit of excess điện tích on it but not much. And what I'm going to do Bây giờ is I'm going to điện tích my pipe or the PDC pipes Vậy all I do is I just take the rabbit pelt and just rub it up against it. Được rồi I have quite a bit of điện tích on it. Bây giờ watch what happens when I bring it close to this neutral can over here. Oh see you can control the motion of the can and I'm not touching it here. I'm not touching it. Be very very careful and you can see the closer I have it the faster the lực but I can make this can move or accelerate pretty fast just by bringing it close to it. Được rồi kind of a cool little experiment you could do. Vậy PDC pipe is negatively charged. The question is Bây giờ why does that can end up being attracted to the PDC pipe. If this is neutral Vậy what happens over here. Let's have a look at that Được rồi Vậy let's have a look at my PVR pipes or after rubbing it with the pelt. The PDC since it appears at the bottom of this tribal electric series we said that it gains electrons very easily. OK. Vậy that becomes negatively charged. OK Vậy we're gonna have access negative điện tích over here on this PDC pipe and then I bring it close to an aluminum can which is really neutral. Đúng. It has the same number of positives and negatives. Đúng. It has all these aluminum atoms just Đúng next to each other. However it is kind of a conducting material. Đúng. And the electrons actually are able to move. Vậy imagine Bây giờ you bring this negatively charged object if you bring it closer. OK if I bring it closer. Well what happens. Đúng. Imagine initially we had kind of electrons. And again it's only the electrons that moves I'm only going to draw the electrons but clearly there is also positive các điện tích for each one of those. Let's just draw both of them. Được rồi. Just imagine this can here made up of only a few atoms. Được rồi. Vậy what happens. Well as you bring this closer we know Bây giờ that these negative các điện tích on the PDC pipe are going to đẩy the negative các điện tích of the aluminum can. Đúng. And what's going to happen is these guys here are basically going to move. Bây giờ some of them are kind of closer to the atoms to the positive protons of the aluminum. Vậy they're going to stay there. But there are some electrons that want to move away from it. Đúng. Because they get repelled by these negative các điện tích. Vậy when they move away from it what happens then. Well we've got to get rid of some of these excess electrons on this side. And what we're left with then is this picture of excess positive các điện tích on this side fewer Oh I lost my can. Let's try. Let's try this. And chúng ta có a net positive điện tích over here. I'm going to add extra electrons because some of the electrons that were closer on this side end up moving on this side. Đúng. Vậy what happens over here for this can. Vậy this side of the CAN side that's far away is becomes more negative and the side over here that's closest to the PDC rod. This guy here becomes more positive always that mean in terms of the các lực Bây giờ. I think about all the các lực involved. Each one of these các điện tích interacts with every điện tích over here but as a whole you get kind of all of these negative các điện tích which are going to interact with these ones that's a attractive lực on the can f this way. And there's also a repulsive lực from this PDC pipe to the excess negative các điện tích over here however that lực might draw like this. This is the other lực Đúng from the repulsive lực between the các điện tích. However this véctơ is smaller than this one. Đúng. And the reason that it's smaller is simply due to the khoảng cách. Được rồi. This khoảng cách over here is small. OK. Small khoảng cách we saw from cool Ohm's Law. Small khoảng cách equals a bigger lực. Vậy the net lực on the can then has to be in this hướng. There is Không way for me to take this pipe into actually đẩy the can. It's always going to be attractive when I bring the pipe on the other side. Again the electrons just want to get away from it. Vậy they kind of move to the other side of the car. And the ones that can. Some of these electrons are free electrons are not bound not tightly bound to the positives of the aluminum. The aluminum atoms. Được rồi. Vậy that's kind of the simple explanation as to why this can is always attracted to this PDC pipe and you can control its motion just by moving the BBC pipe from one side to the other.
