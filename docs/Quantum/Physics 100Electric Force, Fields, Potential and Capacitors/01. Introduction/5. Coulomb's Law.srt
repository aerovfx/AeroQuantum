00:00.180 --> 00:03.490
So let's talk about cool homes now cool Ohm's law now.

00:03.540 --> 00:08.010
Well we're going to first assume is that we have two small charges usually these are referred to as

00:08.010 --> 00:13.850
kind of point charges and they are separated by a certain distance.

00:13.890 --> 00:16.690
Are so are as measured from center to center.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.480
We already know the direction.

00:18.540 --> 00:18.840
OK.

00:18.870 --> 00:23.010
So we don't have to worry about the direction of the force because we just look at it.

00:23.010 --> 00:26.370
If there are two positive charges the force is repelling.

00:26.370 --> 00:37.020
If they're two negatives that also repels so direction of force is known or now interested in is what

00:37.020 --> 00:38.070
is the magnitude.

00:38.070 --> 00:43.150
So how big is the force how big is f.

00:43.940 --> 00:48.040
OK and that's given by cool law cool homes law you can write as something like this.

00:48.040 --> 00:53.470
The force is equal to there is a constant in the front which is one over for pi.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.170
There's this other value here which I'll get to in just a second.

00:56.740 --> 00:58.380
And the important stuff is right here.

00:58.450 --> 01:07.450
Q1 the magnitude Q2 the magnitude I put absolute values in there and divided bytes depends on how far

01:07.450 --> 01:07.770
they are.

01:07.780 --> 01:11.030
But it's the distance squared.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.380
So let's look at this equation in just a little bit more detail.

01:14.410 --> 01:17.500
So first of all this guy right here Epsilon 0.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.800
This is a constant.

01:18.940 --> 01:25.510
And it's referred to as the permitting city of free space.

01:25.600 --> 01:29.530
So all you have to do is open your book and just find its value.

01:29.710 --> 01:30.030
OK.

01:30.040 --> 01:36.100
So people have kind of measured that and in a value is eight point eight five times 10 to the negative

01:36.120 --> 01:37.060
twelve.

01:37.340 --> 01:43.000
The units for this again at the end of the day I need to have Newton's on the left hand side of cool

01:43.000 --> 01:45.840
Ohm's Law in an order for all that to work out.

01:45.880 --> 01:48.580
You're going to need cool loam squared.

01:48.590 --> 01:52.230
Per Newton in meters square it's something like this.

01:52.250 --> 01:57.160
These are going to be the units that I'm going to need if at the end of the day this guy is measured

01:57.160 --> 02:04.180
in Newton's because I'll have to cancel cool ohms twice and I'll have to cancel meters squared also.

02:04.420 --> 02:10.380
This is referred to as a inverse square law.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.030
You might have seen the force of gravity.

02:13.050 --> 02:13.230
Right.

02:13.230 --> 02:19.040
Newton's Law of Gravitation is also an inverse square law which means that its inverse.

02:19.050 --> 02:23.820
So the distance between the charges square it appears in the denominator here.

02:23.820 --> 02:26.790
That's why the inverse squared law.

02:26.850 --> 02:27.120
All right.

02:27.120 --> 02:32.550
Now to simplify things a little bit rather than kind of writing it like this a lot of people just kind

02:32.550 --> 02:36.240
of simplify they'll represent everything here in the bracket.

02:36.240 --> 02:42.900
And again since that's all one constant term you can evaluate that sometimes you rewrite Coombs law

02:42.930 --> 02:48.770
the same law will write it like this or write it as F is some other constant k.

02:48.840 --> 02:55.320
And again everything else is the same Q1 Q2 and again over our squared.

02:55.590 --> 03:02.540
In this case you could see that this value K is nothing more than one over for Pi Epsilon 0.

03:02.790 --> 03:08.100
If you actually take your calculator and evaluate this you should get approximately nine point nine

03:08.290 --> 03:11.870
so a nine point zero times ten to the nine.

03:11.870 --> 03:12.330
Okay.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.920
Now the units are going to be different.

03:13.920 --> 03:20.190
Here here we're gonna have units of Newton's meters squared per Coolum Square they're actually the inverse

03:20.190 --> 03:24.260
of the units of the permitting of free space.

03:24.260 --> 03:24.500
Okay.

03:24.510 --> 03:30.150
So depending on the textbook that you use I kind of like this form is just kind of easier to calculate.

03:30.150 --> 03:35.940
Again it's just a constant term and these are the two things are that are important as to charges here

03:35.940 --> 03:40.740
in the numerator and distance squared in the denominator.

03:40.820 --> 03:41.080
Okay.

03:41.100 --> 03:47.700
So this tells you how big the charges how big the forces sorry how big the forces between both of these

03:47.700 --> 03:48.450
charges.
