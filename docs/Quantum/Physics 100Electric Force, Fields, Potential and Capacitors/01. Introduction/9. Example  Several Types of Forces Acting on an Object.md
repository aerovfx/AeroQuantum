# Example  Several Types of Forces Acting on an Object

## 01. Introduction

### Tóm tắt nội dung

It's sometimes cool Ohm's Law gets mixed into problems where there's other types of các lực present not only electrical các lực. OK Vậy in this problem I want to see an electrical lực with other các lực in the system ví dụ gravitational lực and tension. Vậy let's have a look at this example and see how we would incorporate cool homes law to help us solve this problem. Here's the example Vậy chúng ta có a two Styrofoam balls. OK. Number one and number two on this side. And they each have a mass. OK. The masses 10 grams and they're suspended by threads and the threads we're given their length is 25 centimeters. Được rồi Bây giờ these balls are charged. OK Vậy that's kind of what's gonna make this problem a little bit different. And when they're charged after you set the system up they make this angle here which is 15 degrees with respect to the vertical hướng. OK then I've got a couple questions relating to this configuration for these two Styrofoam balls. First of all are the signs of the các điện tích the same or opposite. Do both of those have to be positive both negative or can one be positive or negative. I think that one's pretty easy to say Đúng. This one definitely Vâng. Đúng. They both have to have the same because we want to have this repulsive lực that pushes them apart. If one of them was negative well then they would be stuck together. Đúng. They'd be kind of over here at the middle and they would rather be kind of Đúng next to each other like that. But that's not what chúng ta có. Vậy Vâng they either have to be both positive or both negative are the magnitudes of the các điện tích necessarily the same. Được rồi. Can you have a Q1 and Q2 and can those be different as long as they're both positive. Actually the answer of this one is they don't necessarily have to be the same. OK. Vậy not not necessarily. You can actually have ví dụ one cool arm and two columns. Đúng. That would tạo ra a lực on this guy in that hướng and it would also tạo ra we saw from Coombs law an bằng nhau và ngược chiều lực on this one. Được rồi. And it really doesn't matter on the độ lớn of each one because these các lực are going to be the same. OK Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that they don't necessarily have to have the same độ lớn. Được rồi. Vậy that's kind of a little bit of a trickier problem Vậy long as the lực is the same the độ lớn of the các điện tích can be different. Được rồi. However with that being said in the last problem we're going to say let's find the net điện tích on each one. And the important thing here is we are going to assume we are going to assume that the các điện tích are equal. OK. Vậy let's assume that they're either both positive or both negative and we're going to get rid of this little subscript because we're going to assume that both các điện tích are the value Q And that's going to give us a repulsive lực and that's going to give us a free body diagram that looks similar to this one. chúng ta có a wait acting down because our styrofoam balls have a mass of 10 grams. It's connected to a thread which means there has to be some tension tác dụng lên it in the hướng and the tension is always along in the hướng of the thread or the rope. And Bây giờ we're going to have this new lực which is our lực điện and the độ lớn of this guy is given by columns law. Được rồi Vậy let's go on the page the next page and set this up. Bây giờ it doesn't matter whether you do a free body diagram on this guy or the other guy. Đúng you're gonna get the same thing. Just the. các lực are going to be flipped around. My attention would be like this my lực điện would be like this. And the weight would be down if I did it on the điện tích on the left hand side. Được rồi let's go set up the system and our equations and see how chúng ta có thể actually obtain. Our goal is to find what is this value Q Đúng here. Vậy let's set it up and solve the problem Đúng. Vậy here's the free body diagram over here and I've listed some of the numbers Vậy the length of the thread was 25 centimeters the angle here that the thread makes with relative to the vertical that angle theta is 15 degrees. I've also listed this number here or introduce the variable which is the khoảng cách between the two các điện tích which is r and that's required for cool Ohm's Law. Được rồi. And if we look at just the điện tích on the Đúng hand side again if it's not moving it should be an equilibrium. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the tổng of the các lực tác dụng lên that điện tích have to be equal to zero. That's Newton's first law. Vậy since it's a two dimensional problem what we're gonna do here is we're gonna look at it in the x hướng and in the y hướng separately. This is gonna be my x hướng and this is my vertical hướng is the y hướng over here. Được rồi. Vậy let's just kind of clean this up a little bit. Vậy in the x hướng what do chúng ta có. chúng ta có an lực điện and the lực điện is pointing to the Đúng. Vậy we're gonna have plus the electrical lực that's given by columns law. We'll come back in a minute. And then what else is acting in the x hướng. Well there's all a component of the tension Đúng. If I break my tension down into two các lực there's this guy Đúng here and this is the tension in the x hướng Vậy I'm gonna write this as minus the tension in the x hướng. Được rồi. Vậy chúng ta có thể take this one step further. This is my lực điện. And how do I write tension in the x hướng using the độ lớn of the tension Đúng here. I could use some trigonometry over here if this angle is 15 degrees then the tension in the x hướng should be the tension multiplied by sign of 15 degrees. Make sure you understand this part. That's really important. And that is should be equal to zero because there is Không net lực in that x hướng. Được rồi how about in the vertical hướng Bây giờ. Được. In the vertical hướng chúng ta có two các lực. chúng ta có a component of the tension that is acting up. That's this guy Đúng here. I'm gonna call this t y and then chúng ta có the wait acting down and the độ lớn of the weight is simply M.G.. Đúng the mass of the styrofoam ball multiplied by Little G and the mass was 10 grams I think. Được rồi. Vậy let's go back Bây giờ and writes Đúng the tổng of the các lực in the vertical hướng. Vậy chúng ta có t y acting up and chúng ta có minus the weight or minus M.G. acting down again. Let's get rid of t y and let's write it in terms of the tension T. Again if that angle is 15 degrees điều đó có nghĩa là that this interior angle here is also 15 degrees. And then you should be able to write t coasts of 15 degrees minus the weight minus M.G. equals to zero. OK Vậy Bây giờ we've got two equations Đúng. Here's phương trình 1 in the x hướng and phương trình 2 in the y hướng. Bây giờ let's go see what our unknowns are really we want to get rid of tension Đúng Bây giờ because tension doesn't help us. Vậy let me go ahead and first fix the phương trình 1. What I'm gonna do is I'm going to bring t sine 15 on the other side Vậy I have that my electrical lực should be equal to T sign of 15 degrees. Được rồi how about phương trình 2 phương trình to do the same thing. I'm going to bring the weight on the other side and the weight is something I know because I know the mass of the styrofoam balls. Vậy chúng ta có M.G. which is t coasts of 15 degrees for me to eliminate the tension which you can do here is is using both of these equations. Let's get rid of tension. One thing I could do is just divide one phương trình by the other phương trình. If I just divide both sides that's going to eliminate the tension. Vậy that's gonna be something I want to do here. Vậy if I do one divided by phương trình 2 this will eliminate T and we're gonna be left with this. Vậy the electrical lực divided by M.G. is going to be equal sine divided by coasts is actually tangent tangent of 15 degrees. Được rồi one last step Bây giờ I want to. Well let's figure out what is my electrical lực here for this problem. Vậy what I have our two các điện tích they have the same độ lớn. Đúng Vậy let's go ahead and write an expression for this electrical lực chúng ta có our hằng số k both các điện tích are the same Vậy that numerator for cool Ohm's law simply becomes Q bình phương and Bây giờ it's divided by the khoảng cách bình phương r bình phương R bình phương. I don't really know Đúng Bây giờ. Đúng. However I do know that the string is twenty five centimeters long. Đúng. Vậy actually if you use a little bit of trigonometry you should be able to find this khoảng cách Đúng here D Đúng. This is called D the khoảng cách from the điện tích all the way to the vertical are half. And once you know D then R is simply going to be two times that value D. Vậy you should be able to write something like this. This is simply two times D and then D you should be on the Đúng in terms of some trigonometry. You should be able to write this is too and this here should be D should be the length of that rope twenty five centimeters already and meters Đúng away and multiplied by sine a 15 degrees. Được rồi good. Vậy that is the value are you can go ahead and substitute and find a value for that. And that's required because that's what gets substituted into my cool Ohm's Law. Được rồi. Vậy and again the reason you have to introduce this at the end this is what we're trying to find is the Q value. Vậy let's do a little bit more algebra and get Q by itself. Vậy what I'm going to do is I'm going to substitute this entire expression here inside my lực the electrical lực expression Đúng here. First thing you could do is bring the M.G. over on the other side. Vậy let's go ahead and start by doing that. Let's get rid of this and if I write it on this side I'm gonna have M.G. and the other thing I want to do Bây giờ is eliminate my electrical lực. Vậy the electrical lực I'm going gonna write it as K Q bình phương over R bình phương. Được rồi Bây giờ you have to do is just get Q by itself which means I bring the r bình phương over here. Get rid of it over here and I bring the K at the bottom. Which means I can get rid of it there and I have to divide by that value Được. The last thing I want to eliminate is the bình phương term. Vậy my final expression for q is equal to this. And then you've got to take the square root of everything. Vậy I have tangent of 15 degrees I have the weight. M.G. I have our bình phương and are here I'm gonna just go ahead and substitute everything here. This is two zero point two five sign of 15 is kind of a really long expression. You have to be careful when you substitute this in your calculator. Then at the end it's divided by my hằng số K and everything here is actually under the square root term. B put another bracket around there. Được rồi if you're really really careful when you do this at the end you should get a value of the hằng số. Sorry the điện tích the độ lớn of the điện tích which is zero point to two times 10 to the negative 6 and that's measured in columns. Được rồi kind of a lengthy problem. It involves two equations and two unknowns. And the reason that we needed two equations and two at least two equations was even from phương trình 1. We weren't really able to find the điện tích cube because chúng ta có to get rid of this Đúng. There is nowhere where we're asked to solve for tension and we don't know what the value of the tension is. Vậy that's really why we needed the second phương trình in order to Đúng the tension in terms of the weight and the weight is something we know Đúng. The math was given as a 10 grams I think. Vậy remember to convert that into kilograms. Anyway that's it for this problem.
