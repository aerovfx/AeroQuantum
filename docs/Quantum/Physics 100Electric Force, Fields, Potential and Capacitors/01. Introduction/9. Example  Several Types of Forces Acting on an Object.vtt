00:00.110 --> 00:06.180
It's sometimes cool Ohm's Law gets mixed into problems where there's other types of forces present not

00:06.240 --> 00:08.000
only electrical forces.

00:08.010 --> 00:15.120
OK so in this problem I want to see an electrical force with other forces in the system for example

00:15.120 --> 00:17.250
gravitational force and tension.

00:17.250 --> 00:22.230
So let's have a look at this example and see how we would incorporate cool homes law to help us solve

00:22.230 --> 00:22.980
this problem.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.700
Here's the example so we have a two Styrofoam balls.

00:25.710 --> 00:25.980
OK.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.430
Number one and number two on this side.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.240
And they each have a mass.

00:30.270 --> 00:30.510
OK.

00:30.510 --> 00:36.360
The masses 10 grams and they're suspended by threads and the threads we're given their length is 25

00:36.360 --> 00:37.620
centimeters.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.690
All right now these balls are charged.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.790
OK so that's kind of what's gonna make this problem a little bit different.

00:42.930 --> 00:49.110
And when they're charged after you set the system up they make this angle here which is 15 degrees with

00:49.110 --> 00:50.960
respect to the vertical direction.

00:51.090 --> 00:57.440
OK then I've got a couple questions relating to this configuration for these two Styrofoam balls.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.930
First of all are the signs of the charges the same or opposite.

01:01.950 --> 01:05.880
Do both of those have to be positive both negative or can one be positive or negative.

01:05.880 --> 01:08.160
I think that one's pretty easy to say right.

01:08.190 --> 01:10.000
This one definitely yes.

01:10.000 --> 01:10.160
Right.

01:10.170 --> 01:15.700
They both have to have the same because we want to have this repulsive force that pushes them apart.

01:15.810 --> 01:20.070
If one of them was negative well then they would be stuck together.

01:20.090 --> 01:20.220
Right.

01:20.220 --> 01:24.180
They'd be kind of over here at the middle and they would rather be kind of right next to each other

01:24.180 --> 01:24.560
like that.

01:24.570 --> 01:26.010
But that's not what we have.

01:26.010 --> 01:33.060
So yes they either have to be both positive or both negative are the magnitudes of the charges necessarily

01:33.060 --> 01:34.050
the same.

01:34.050 --> 01:34.260
All right.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.600
Can you have a Q1 and Q2 and can those be different as long as they're both positive.

01:40.020 --> 01:44.340
Actually the answer of this one is they don't necessarily have to be the same.

01:44.370 --> 01:44.600
OK.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.410
So not not necessarily.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.710
You can actually have for example one cool arm and two columns.

01:52.730 --> 01:52.880
Right.

01:52.890 --> 01:58.670
That would produce a force on this guy in that direction and it would also produce we saw from Coombs

01:58.770 --> 02:02.180
law an equal and opposite force on this one.

02:02.180 --> 02:02.960
All right.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.210
And it really doesn't matter on the magnitude of each one because these forces are going to be the same.

02:08.220 --> 02:12.730
OK so that means that they don't necessarily have to have the same magnitude.

02:12.750 --> 02:12.950
All right.

02:12.960 --> 02:18.930
So that's kind of a little bit of a trickier problem so long as the force is the same the magnitude

02:18.930 --> 02:21.060
of the charges can be different.

02:21.060 --> 02:21.400
All right.

02:21.630 --> 02:27.600
However with that being said in the last problem we're going to say let's find the net charge on each

02:27.600 --> 02:28.260
one.

02:28.350 --> 02:36.090
And the important thing here is we are going to assume we are going to assume that the charges are equal.

02:36.240 --> 02:36.820
OK.

02:36.840 --> 02:42.390
So let's assume that they're either both positive or both negative and we're going to get rid of this

02:42.390 --> 02:48.750
little subscript because we're going to assume that both charges are the value Q And that's going to

02:48.750 --> 02:54.240
give us a repulsive force and that's going to give us a free body diagram that looks similar to this

02:54.240 --> 02:54.810
one.

02:54.930 --> 03:01.420
We have a wait acting down because our styrofoam balls have a mass of 10 grams.

03:01.710 --> 03:06.870
It's connected to a thread which means there has to be some tension acting on it in the direction and

03:06.890 --> 03:11.160
the tension is always along in the direction of the thread or the rope.

03:11.250 --> 03:17.310
And now we're going to have this new force which is our electric force and the magnitude of this guy

03:17.310 --> 03:18.870
is given by columns law.

03:19.140 --> 03:22.120
All right so let's go on the page the next page and set this up.

03:22.140 --> 03:26.630
Now it doesn't matter whether you do a free body diagram on this guy or the other guy.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.470
Right you're gonna get the same thing.

03:28.590 --> 03:29.010
Just the.

03:29.010 --> 03:30.510
Forces are going to be flipped around.

03:30.510 --> 03:34.240
My attention would be like this my electric force would be like this.

03:34.260 --> 03:38.640
And the weight would be down if I did it on the charge on the left hand side.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.720
All right let's go set up the system and our equations and see how we can actually obtain.

03:42.900 --> 03:46.110
Our goal is to find what is this value Q Right here.

03:46.110 --> 03:49.030
So let's set it up and solve the problem right.

03:49.050 --> 03:54.960
So here's the free body diagram over here and I've listed some of the numbers so the length of the thread

03:54.960 --> 04:01.110
was 25 centimeters the angle here that the thread makes with relative to the vertical that angle theta

04:01.110 --> 04:02.670
is 15 degrees.

04:02.700 --> 04:08.040
I've also listed this number here or introduce the variable which is the distance between the two charges

04:08.040 --> 04:11.420
which is r and that's required for cool Ohm's Law.

04:11.420 --> 04:11.720
All right.

04:11.730 --> 04:18.800
And if we look at just the charge on the right hand side again if it's not moving it should be an equilibrium.

04:18.840 --> 04:24.600
So that means that the sum of the forces acting on that charge have to be equal to zero.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.460
That's Newton's first law.

04:26.730 --> 04:31.440
So since it's a two dimensional problem what we're gonna do here is we're gonna look at it in the x

04:31.440 --> 04:35.410
direction and in the y direction separately.

04:35.430 --> 04:40.740
This is gonna be my x direction and this is my vertical direction is the y direction over here.

04:40.830 --> 04:41.180
All right.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.730
So let's just kind of clean this up a little bit.

04:43.770 --> 04:45.410
So in the x direction what do we have.

04:45.420 --> 04:49.340
We have an electric force and the electric force is pointing to the right.

04:49.410 --> 04:55.490
So we're gonna have plus the electrical force that's given by columns law.

04:55.490 --> 04:56.480
We'll come back in a minute.

04:56.910 --> 04:59.130
And then what else is acting in the x direction.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.980
Well there's all a component of the tension right.

05:01.990 --> 05:07.210
If I break my tension down into two forces there's this guy right here and this is the tension in the

05:07.210 --> 05:13.680
x direction so I'm gonna write this as minus the tension in the x direction.

05:13.680 --> 05:13.910
All right.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.990
So we can take this one step further.

05:16.030 --> 05:17.710
This is my electric force.

05:17.860 --> 05:23.710
And how do I write tension in the x direction using the magnitude of the tension right here.

05:23.710 --> 05:30.490
I could use some trigonometry over here if this angle is 15 degrees then the tension in the x direction

05:31.120 --> 05:36.850
should be the tension multiplied by sign of 15 degrees.

05:36.910 --> 05:38.340
Make sure you understand this part.

05:38.370 --> 05:39.610
That's really important.

05:39.790 --> 05:45.140
And that is should be equal to zero because there is no net force in that x direction.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.480
All right how about in the vertical direction now.

05:47.520 --> 05:47.740
Okay.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.500
In the vertical direction we have two forces.

05:50.620 --> 05:53.600
We have a component of the tension that is acting up.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.170
That's this guy right here.

05:55.630 --> 06:01.510
I'm gonna call this t y and then we have the wait acting down and the magnitude of the weight is simply

06:01.510 --> 06:02.380
M.G..

06:02.450 --> 06:08.560
Right the mass of the styrofoam ball multiplied by Little G and the mass was 10 grams I think.

06:08.560 --> 06:08.830
All right.

06:08.860 --> 06:12.840
So let's go back now and writes right the sum of the forces in the vertical direction.

06:12.910 --> 06:19.950
So we have t y acting up and we have minus the weight or minus M.G. acting down again.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.890
Let's get rid of t y and let's write it in terms of the tension T.

06:24.130 --> 06:30.190
Again if that angle is 15 degrees that means that this interior angle here is also 15 degrees.

06:30.190 --> 06:40.690
And then you should be able to write t coasts of 15 degrees minus the weight minus M.G. equals to zero.

06:40.930 --> 06:43.480
OK so now we've got two equations right.

06:43.490 --> 06:47.770
Here's equation 1 in the x direction and equation 2 in the y direction.

06:47.770 --> 06:53.830
Now let's go see what our unknowns are really we want to get rid of tension right now because tension

06:53.830 --> 06:54.580
doesn't help us.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.430
So let me go ahead and first fix the equation 1.

06:58.720 --> 07:05.080
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to bring t sine 15 on the other side so I have that my electrical force

07:05.830 --> 07:10.840
should be equal to T sign of 15 degrees.

07:10.840 --> 07:15.340
All right how about equation 2 equation to do the same thing.

07:15.340 --> 07:20.110
I'm going to bring the weight on the other side and the weight is something I know because I know the

07:20.110 --> 07:22.180
mass of the styrofoam balls.

07:22.180 --> 07:30.870
So we have M.G. which is t coasts of 15 degrees for me to eliminate the tension which you can do here

07:30.870 --> 07:32.700
is is using both of these equations.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.020
Let's get rid of tension.

07:34.060 --> 07:38.020
One thing I could do is just divide one equation by the other equation.

07:38.020 --> 07:42.250
If I just divide both sides that's going to eliminate the tension.

07:42.550 --> 07:44.200
So that's gonna be something I want to do here.

07:44.230 --> 07:49.330
So if I do one divided by equation 2 this will eliminate

07:52.430 --> 07:54.650
T and we're gonna be left with this.

07:54.680 --> 08:03.170
So the electrical force divided by M.G. is going to be equal sine divided by coasts is actually tangent

08:03.770 --> 08:06.080
tangent of 15 degrees.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.480
All right one last step now I want to.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.760
Well let's figure out what is my electrical force here for this problem.

08:12.830 --> 08:16.010
So what I have our two charges they have the same magnitude.

08:16.050 --> 08:22.520
Right so let's go ahead and write an expression for this electrical force we have our constant k both

08:22.520 --> 08:28.970
charges are the same so that numerator for cool Ohm's law simply becomes Q squared and now it's divided

08:28.970 --> 08:33.590
by the distance squared r squared R squared.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.340
I don't really know right now.

08:35.410 --> 08:35.850
Right.

08:35.870 --> 08:41.200
However I do know that the string is twenty five centimeters long.

08:41.290 --> 08:41.790
Right.

08:41.810 --> 08:46.340
So actually if you use a little bit of trigonometry you should be able to find this distance right here

08:46.650 --> 08:47.340
D right.

08:47.350 --> 08:52.780
This is called D the distance from the charge all the way to the vertical are half.

08:52.940 --> 08:57.950
And once you know D then R is simply going to be two times that value D.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.340
So you should be able to write something like this.

09:00.440 --> 09:07.270
This is simply two times D and then D you should be on the right in terms of some trigonometry.

09:07.730 --> 09:14.010
You should be able to write this is too and this here should be D should be the length of that rope

09:14.050 --> 09:22.230
twenty five centimeters already and meters right away and multiplied by sine a 15 degrees.

09:22.490 --> 09:23.630
All right good.

09:23.690 --> 09:29.660
So that is the value are you can go ahead and substitute and find a value for that.

09:31.470 --> 09:37.290
And that's required because that's what gets substituted into my cool Ohm's Law.

09:37.320 --> 09:37.710
All right.

09:37.740 --> 09:42.540
So and again the reason you have to introduce this at the end this is what we're trying to find is the

09:42.540 --> 09:43.260
Q value.

09:43.320 --> 09:46.920
So let's do a little bit more algebra and get Q by itself.

09:46.920 --> 09:53.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to substitute this entire expression here inside my force the electrical

09:53.100 --> 09:54.900
force expression right here.

09:55.290 --> 09:58.430
First thing you could do is bring the M.G. over on the other side.

09:58.530 --> 10:00.170
So let's go ahead and start by doing that.

10:00.190 --> 10:07.010
Let's get rid of this and if I write it on this side I'm gonna have M.G. and the other thing I want

10:07.010 --> 10:10.650
to do now is eliminate my electrical force.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.480
So the electrical force I'm going gonna write it as K Q squared over R squared.

10:19.610 --> 10:24.860
All right now you have to do is just get Q by itself which means I bring the r squared over here.

10:26.670 --> 10:29.360
Get rid of it over here and I bring the K at the bottom.

10:29.430 --> 10:35.290
Which means I can get rid of it there and I have to divide by that value okay.

10:35.490 --> 10:39.650
The last thing I want to eliminate is the squared term.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.830
So my final expression for q is equal to this.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.400
And then you've got to take the square root of everything.

10:46.590 --> 10:52.140
So I have tangent of 15 degrees I have the weight.

10:52.430 --> 11:01.000
M.G. I have our squared and are here I'm gonna just go ahead and substitute everything here.

11:01.130 --> 11:09.830
This is two zero point two five sign of 15 is kind of a really long expression.

11:09.940 --> 11:12.830
You have to be careful when you substitute this in your calculator.

11:13.010 --> 11:19.120
Then at the end it's divided by my constant K and everything here is actually under the square root

11:19.120 --> 11:20.980
term.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.510
B put another bracket around there.

11:23.580 --> 11:28.880
All right if you're really really careful when you do this at the end you should get a value of the

11:28.880 --> 11:29.780
constant.

11:29.930 --> 11:37.160
Sorry the charge the magnitude of the charge which is zero point to two times 10 to the negative 6 and

11:37.160 --> 11:39.840
that's measured in columns.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.220
All right kind of a lengthy problem.

11:43.250 --> 11:46.180
It involves two equations and two unknowns.

11:46.310 --> 11:52.610
And the reason that we needed two equations and two at least two equations was even from equation 1.

11:52.700 --> 11:57.300
We weren't really able to find the charge cube because we have to get rid of this right.

11:57.330 --> 12:01.220
There is nowhere where we're asked to solve for tension and we don't know what the value of the tension

12:01.220 --> 12:01.620
is.

12:01.760 --> 12:06.590
So that's really why we needed the second equation in order to right the tension in terms of the weight

12:07.010 --> 12:08.390
and the weight is something we know right.

12:08.420 --> 12:11.030
The math was given as a 10 grams I think.

12:11.130 --> 12:15.420
So remember to convert that into kilograms.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.150
Anyway that's it for this problem.
