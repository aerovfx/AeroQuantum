00:00.140 --> 00:04.200
The other way that you can actually charge an object is through something called induction.

00:04.230 --> 00:04.460
OK.

00:04.500 --> 00:07.130
So let's start with the figure here at the top.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.160
We have here is a kind of a metal sphere.

00:10.170 --> 00:17.610
So I mean just write this down metal sphere and first of all it is a neutral.

00:17.700 --> 00:20.540
So it has the same number of positives and negatives.

00:20.590 --> 00:21.370
OK.

00:21.660 --> 00:24.410
It's also not sitting on the ground here right.

00:24.420 --> 00:30.210
This here is a piece of glass or something that is a not a conductor.

00:30.240 --> 00:30.430
OK.

00:30.450 --> 00:36.270
As long as this piece you that's supporting it is non conducting right we say it's kind of an insulator

00:38.460 --> 00:38.850
OK.

00:38.940 --> 00:43.680
So that means that whatever charges are here are kind of stuck on the sphere.

00:43.900 --> 00:49.290
All right and Figure B what you do here imagine I bring my PDC Rod here that I've rubbed with the rabbit

00:49.290 --> 00:53.220
pelt and it's negatively charged again.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.560
Now it's kind of the same picture as the can.

00:55.560 --> 00:55.860
Right.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.840
Can we had those electrons that moved to the other side of the can is shown over here and the positive

01:00.840 --> 01:02.940
ones are over here and that's fine.

01:02.970 --> 01:08.160
So there is a little bit of an attractive force here between the rod and the metal sphere.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.750
Well that's all fine and dandy.

01:09.750 --> 01:13.970
Now this is not going to move because it's kind of stuck to the ground down here.

01:14.010 --> 01:14.310
All right.

01:14.310 --> 01:21.480
So now imagine we connected a wire as connected from the sphere and goes all the way to the ground and

01:21.480 --> 01:23.650
we repeat the same experiment.

01:23.670 --> 01:28.520
What that means is now the electrons instead of piling up here on the opposite side of the sphere.

01:28.650 --> 01:33.110
We now give them a path to actually leave the surface of the sphere.

01:33.730 --> 01:33.950
OK.

01:33.990 --> 01:39.370
So they're actually leaving and going to the ground the ground can accept a lot of charges.

01:39.600 --> 01:45.280
And then what we remove while we remove that we remove that wire OK.

01:45.390 --> 01:48.670
We remove the wire and then if we remove the rod.

01:49.140 --> 01:49.940
Well what happens.

01:49.950 --> 01:50.790
So a couple of things.

01:50.790 --> 01:55.950
So all those electrons that were on the other side of the sphere went through that wire and they ended

01:55.950 --> 01:56.630
up on the ground.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.300
So the ground becomes slightly negatively charged.

02:00.450 --> 02:00.840
OK.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.500
And you could see that down here.

02:02.640 --> 02:11.370
And then once you remove the rod again what you're going to end up getting here is a positively charged

02:11.370 --> 02:12.810
sphere at the end.

02:12.840 --> 02:13.330
OK.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.400
It becomes positively charged.

02:15.420 --> 02:19.160
Now these pictures a little bit misleading these charges are not physically moving.

02:19.170 --> 02:25.140
It's just the total charge of the object now will become because of the electron motion and they go

02:25.140 --> 02:27.950
back to some equilibrium configuration at the end.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.700
The object will become positively charged.

02:30.720 --> 02:31.020
OK.

02:31.260 --> 02:34.910
So at no point did the actual rod touch the sphere.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.250
So that's really important.

02:36.270 --> 02:36.590
Yeah.

02:36.780 --> 02:39.730
And this is what is called charging by induction.

02:39.780 --> 02:44.530
This is how we would obtain a positively charged object.

02:44.530 --> 02:45.070
OK.

02:45.090 --> 02:47.310
Remember it's only the electrons that can move.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.460
That's really really important.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.020
The positive charges do not move.
