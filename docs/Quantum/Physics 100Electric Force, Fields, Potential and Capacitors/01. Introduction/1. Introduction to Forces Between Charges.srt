00:00.650 --> 00:00.950
All right.

00:00.950 --> 00:05.750
So we start off with some basic things, some things that you might already know even before kind of

00:05.750 --> 00:07.790
studying anything to do with electrostatic.

00:08.570 --> 00:13.070
The first statement I have here is that like charges, they repel each other.

00:13.370 --> 00:16.130
So let's consider the two cases of like charges.

00:16.130 --> 00:16.330
Right?

00:16.340 --> 00:18.530
We have positive and a positive charge.

00:19.400 --> 00:25.400
Another case we would have would be a negative charge separated by a certain distance from another negative

00:25.400 --> 00:26.000
charge.

00:26.450 --> 00:26.660
All right.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.700
So these are the like charges.

00:28.700 --> 00:34.670
And, well, one thing we can do is write down the force acting between the like charges.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.940
So if a positive is next to a positive, there would be a force acting like this, acting on the left

00:40.940 --> 00:41.450
charge.

00:41.450 --> 00:46.850
And we're going to have a force acting to the right on this or on the left and the right.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.310
How about two negatives right next to each other?

00:49.310 --> 00:53.360
Again, they would feel a repulsive force between both of them.

00:53.630 --> 00:57.200
And I'm going to label that force just with the same letter F.

00:58.490 --> 00:58.910
All right.

00:58.910 --> 01:00.350
So a couple of things.

01:00.350 --> 01:01.990
These forces are opposite.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.530
They're equal magnitude.

01:03.860 --> 01:04.220
Right.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.040
And they're acting on the different charges.

01:07.160 --> 01:11.390
Let's consider the last statement over here says Opposite charges attract to each other.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.990
Now, I can plot it any way I want, but let's just do it this way.

01:16.010 --> 01:20.270
We have the positive separated from a negative by a certain distance.

01:20.690 --> 01:22.550
Again, now they attract each other.

01:22.550 --> 01:27.760
So that means the force that you would add would be like this one forces acting on the positive charge,

01:27.770 --> 01:30.980
the other force would be acting on the negative charge, and that's it.

01:31.370 --> 01:35.300
Now these forces form action reaction pairs, right?

01:35.630 --> 01:38.620
This is really Newton's third law at work here.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.670
So let me just write down that down.

01:40.670 --> 01:46.460
Newton's third law and third law says for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.

01:46.910 --> 01:49.490
And you need three things for Newton's third law, right?

01:49.490 --> 01:51.700
We need the same force.

01:51.710 --> 01:52.460
That's what we have.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.360
We need opposite direction.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.410
That's what we have.

01:57.630 --> 01:58.650
I'll just write opposite.

01:58.650 --> 01:59.400
And number three.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.950
What we do need are different objects.

02:02.490 --> 02:02.790
Right.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.350
In this case, what are the objects?

02:04.350 --> 02:06.150
We have different charges.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.770
Okay, that is what's going on.

02:08.010 --> 02:12.690
So these action reaction pairs, this force here obeys Newton's third law.

02:12.840 --> 02:14.820
All right, so just get us started over here.
