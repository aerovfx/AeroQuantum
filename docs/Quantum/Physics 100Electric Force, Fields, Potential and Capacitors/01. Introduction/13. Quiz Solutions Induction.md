Take a look at the solutions here for the quiz number one first question says if two objects are electrically attracted to each other Được. Then there have some choices over here both objects must be negatively charged. Well let's have a look at two things that are negatively charged to objects. Không that won't work Đúng. These are not attracted to each other. These would have a lực that would be repulsive. Vậy actually this one is wrong. Both objects must be positively charged. Again that's kind of the same thing Đúng. These are both positively charged. They would be repelled by each other. Vậy Vậy that one there also doesn't work. Được rồi. Clean that up a little bit. Next one object must be negatively charged and the other must be positively điện tích. Let's draw that one. Vậy this one's negatively charged. This one's positively charged. Well that one would kind of work. The only thing that I don't really like about this one here is that it says it must. OK. Sometimes you have to be careful with these words. Vậy let's have a look at the next one. The object could be I kind of prefer words like could and let's go see why it could be electrically neutral. However it says neutral over there. Vậy this one's actually a little bit of a tricky problem. Let me show you kind of two neutral objects Đúng. Vậy one of them is like this and positive and negative and this one is positive and negative. Well if you look at all the interactions that we would have there would be an interaction between the positive and the negative here that would be attractive. There would be a repulsive lực between the two positives and then you could do the same thing with the negative Đúng. Vậy you might say that those cancel out and you'd probably be true. However there is another way you can draw these neutral objects I imagine I have a neutral object that looks like this. What if it's more positively charged on one side of the object versus the other. Đúng. And over on this side I have the same thing. Được rồi. And I've shown you how to tạo ra objects like this. Đúng. What if I bring a rod over here that is negatively charged what it's going to do is it's going to push the negative các điện tích on one side. Được rồi. But what is the interaction here between this guy and this guy. Both of these are neutral. They're not touching each other. However these guys would be attractive because you could see that the positive and the negative here are closer together. Đúng. Although these chúng ta có some repulsion between these positives and these positives they're farther apart. Vậy the net lực here is actually attractive Vậy actually the best answer is actually this one over here choice D. The little bit of a tricky one you might have said See. However it's not always the case. OK. Because here you can have two neutral objects that hút each other. Được rồi let's go do problem to let me scroll down over here Vậy chúng ta có thể see the full question. Problem 2 says chúng ta có these diagrams here it says X and Y are two uncharged spherical spheres. OK. On insulating stands and there are in contact with each other. OK. Vậy that's also important. điều đó có nghĩa là that electrons can go from x to y positively charged Đúng over here is brought closer to X is shown hình cầu Y is then moved the way. What is the final điện tích of both X and Y. Được rồi well let's think about electrons again. Electrons are the things that are going to move. Vậy imagine here chúng ta có certain number of electrons electrons are going to be attracted to this rod. Đúng. Vậy there's going to be more electrons that are going to move from Y since it's in contact over here it means the electrons can move to this side. Vậy what does that leave điện tích on the hình cầu wide. điều đó có nghĩa là overall it's going to be positively charged because the electrons are going to move over electrons move this way OK. Vậy what does that mean then after you remove everything and you split him up. Vậy once you split them up the các điện tích are stuck. They can't fly off the hình cầu. Vậy what you're doing here is you're going to be leaving the system kind of like this positively charged object and negatively charged object. Được rồi. Vậy both X and Y are neutral. Không that's not going to happen. X is positive. Không we said X is going to be negative x is neutral. Nope. Again the best answer is D is the best answer Đúng. X is negative y is positive. Được rồi. Vậy kind of a good little problem there. Let's go to problem three. Me scroll down. Our problem three says two on điện tích spheres again. Well let's go ahead and draw them. This will be hình cầu 1 and hình cầu 2. OK third metal hình cầu carrying a positive điện tích is then placed. Được rồi. Vậy let's place hình cầu 3 is always a good idea to draw a little sketch of what's going on. This one is positively charged OK it's placed closer to 2. Bây giờ a copper wire is momentarily connected. OK. Vậy we're going to put a conducting path over here between the two and it's then removed. Finally hình cầu three is removed. Well let's see what happens to these electrons again. They're probably neutral and initially they're uncharged. And once I bring this positive over here what happens. Well it's going to hút some of the electrons the electrons from hình cầu number one are going to move this way at the end that's going to leave this guy here positively charged because it lost some electrons the electrons want to go over here and then what do you do. Well then you remove the conducting wire Vậy you're left with some các điện tích over here. Vậy once you remove the wire again the các điện tích cannot move anymore. Vậy let's have a look what our choices are. They're still in điện tích. Không. hình cầu one carries a positive điện tích and hình cầu to a negative điện tích. I like that one the other ones are kind of the opposite. Nope and Không one Không. Được rồi. Vậy B is actually the best answer for this one. Được rồi Bây giờ let's look at our final one says a negatively charged Rod this time to be a little bit careful as brought close to but does not touch. OK two neutral spheres that are in contact. Vậy it's kind of like question two that the spheres are in contact but they're insulated from the ground. If the two spheres are then separated. Được rồi. Vậy again it's kind of let's just draw it out. hình cầu one hình cầu two initially in contact and then then I burn my rod which is negatively charged. Well let's think about what happens to the electrons when there's a negatively charged object over here electrons want to go this way. Đúng. And you're gonna be left with a net positive điện tích over here. And once you separate them this is going to stay fixed like this. Được rồi. If the two spheres are then separated what kind of điện tích will be on the spheres. Được rồi. The hình cầu near the rod becomes positive and the other hình cầu becomes negative. Yeah. This is what chúng ta có Đúng. This guy here is positive. That's near the rod. And this one's negative. Vậy I kind of like that choice already. Let's look at the other ones. Let's be is the exact opposite of a. And this we know the objects will become charged. OK Vậy a is the best answer for that one. Được rồi hopefully you kind of understand this charging process when you make objects in contact and then you remove them. OK. This điện tích is going to stay fixed on them and you can điện tích objects simply by bringing other objects like rods or other điện tích spheres close to them.
