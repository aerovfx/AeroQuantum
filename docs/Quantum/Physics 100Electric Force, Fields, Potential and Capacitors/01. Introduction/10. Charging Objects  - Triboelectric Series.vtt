00:00.150 --> 00:00.330
All right.

00:00.330 --> 00:05.160
The next thing you want to talk about is actually charging objects because we know if we could put charge

00:05.160 --> 00:09.220
on objects then they're going to be forces acting between them.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.790
So what if I wanted to charge my coffee mug.

00:13.170 --> 00:16.060
What if I wanted to charge this aluminum can.

00:16.080 --> 00:16.530
All right.

00:16.530 --> 00:20.130
There is something called the Tribal electric series.

00:20.140 --> 00:20.560
Okay.

00:20.700 --> 00:25.860
And I've got a list of elements over here of different materials on this tribal electric series.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.330
We'll come back to this in a minute.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.920
The first thing I really want you to understand that when you have any object and you want to charge

00:31.920 --> 00:35.680
it the only thing that you're moving are the electrons.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.460
Okay.

00:36.600 --> 00:43.470
Take this aluminum can for example if I wanted to charge it I can either add electrons to it or I can

00:43.470 --> 00:49.800
remove some of the electrons that are kind of free that are not tightly bound to the nucleus.

00:49.800 --> 00:55.980
The protons and neutrons Do not move for that to happen I would have to break off a piece.

00:56.050 --> 01:02.760
Okay it's really only the electrons that either get added or they get taken away from objects and that's

01:02.760 --> 01:04.530
how you can charge them.

01:04.530 --> 01:04.700
All right.

01:04.710 --> 01:08.010
If I would add electrons to this can somehow.

01:08.520 --> 01:14.850
Then it would become negatively charged if I would remove some of the electrons that are on the outside

01:14.850 --> 01:17.070
of the aluminum nucleus.

01:17.070 --> 01:22.170
What I would do then is I would make it positively charged because I've removed some electrons.

01:22.320 --> 01:22.790
OK.

01:22.920 --> 01:31.080
Now the tribal electric series tells us which materials tend to lose electrons easily and which materials

01:31.080 --> 01:35.360
tend to gain electrons easily so let's have a little look at some of these.

01:35.430 --> 01:40.260
So let's have a look at the rabbit fur the rabbit fur is near the top.

01:40.260 --> 01:40.530
OK.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.690
And near the top.

01:41.690 --> 01:46.440
And I've kind of listed it over here which means it loses electrons really easily.

01:46.470 --> 01:47.250
OK.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.230
This guy loses electrons very very easily.

01:50.230 --> 01:56.360
And what I have here is a piece of rabbit pelt rabbit fur and it's been dyed blue.

01:56.390 --> 01:57.080
But that's OK.

01:57.090 --> 02:02.340
It's still rabbit pelts so this is a material that tends to lose its electrons very easily and it will

02:02.340 --> 02:04.380
lose them when you rub it against something.

02:05.220 --> 02:06.330
So what we want to do now.

02:06.330 --> 02:09.610
Imagine if I wanted to negatively charge an object.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.830
OK.

02:10.890 --> 02:12.140
So here's my object.

02:12.150 --> 02:15.770
I'm gonna have a pipe and here's my rabbit pelt.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.080
OK.

02:18.130 --> 02:22.210
What I want to do this guy here will lose electrons.

02:22.210 --> 02:28.590
So I want to end up having a whole bunch of electrons added electrons on this rod over here.

02:28.600 --> 02:34.010
Okay I imagine here we have a rod or a pipe.

02:34.810 --> 02:36.940
Let me show you the pipe that I'm going to use.

02:36.970 --> 02:42.850
Ideally what you want to do is you want to have a pipe that gains electrons or accepts electrons very

02:42.850 --> 02:43.850
very easily.

02:44.070 --> 02:44.610
OK.

02:44.650 --> 02:46.990
And what I have here is a PDC pipe.

02:46.990 --> 02:49.540
This is used in kind of plumbing right.

02:49.960 --> 02:56.440
And this object actually if I go down this tribal electric series over here the further I go down the

02:56.440 --> 02:59.770
more it's easily for that object to gain electrons.

02:59.790 --> 03:00.040
OK.

03:00.070 --> 03:00.880
That's what we have here.

03:00.880 --> 03:06.980
Game electrons actually PDC pipe is not here but it actually falls right over here.

03:07.030 --> 03:10.770
This is PDC pipe poly vinyl chloride.

03:10.860 --> 03:11.080
OK.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.540
That's this material over here.

03:12.910 --> 03:15.140
And it gains electrons very easily.

03:15.430 --> 03:19.570
So imagine now if I take my rabbit Pelt and I rub it right.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.130
Rabbit pelt loses electrons.

03:21.940 --> 03:25.840
And you rub it against the PDC pipe that's it.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.530
Give it a few strokes like this.

03:27.580 --> 03:33.560
And now what I have here is a piece of pipe that is negatively charged.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.430
You can actually hear it when you rub it.

03:35.440 --> 03:42.860
You can hear the electrons actually jumping across or going onto the pipe this is negatively charged.

03:42.860 --> 03:43.060
All right.

03:43.070 --> 03:45.530
How do I prove that to you that it's negatively charged.

03:45.530 --> 03:47.170
Well let's do a little experiment.

03:47.210 --> 03:52.840
So for this first experiment here I have the aluminum can which is basically neutral right now.

03:52.850 --> 03:56.540
There's maybe a little bit of excess charge on it but not much.

03:56.540 --> 04:03.770
And what I'm going to do now is I'm going to charge my pipe or the PDC pipes so all I do is I just take

04:03.770 --> 04:06.980
the rabbit pelt and just rub it up against it.

04:06.980 --> 04:09.110
All right I have quite a bit of charge on it.

04:09.140 --> 04:12.570
Now watch what happens when I bring it close to this neutral can over here.

04:12.690 --> 04:18.410
Oh see you can control the motion of the can and I'm not touching it here.

04:18.680 --> 04:19.800
I'm not touching it.

04:19.820 --> 04:24.890
Be very very careful and you can see the closer I have it the faster the force but I can make this can

04:24.890 --> 04:29.900
move or accelerate pretty fast just by bringing it close to it.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.250
All right kind of a cool little experiment you could do.

04:33.250 --> 04:36.610
So PDC pipe is negatively charged.

04:36.770 --> 04:41.740
The question is now why does that can end up being attracted to the PDC pipe.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.660
If this is neutral so what happens over here.

04:46.130 --> 04:52.850
Let's have a look at that all right so let's have a look at my PVR pipes or after rubbing it with the

04:52.850 --> 04:53.880
pelt.

04:53.920 --> 05:00.860
The PDC since it appears at the bottom of this tribal electric series we said that it gains electrons

05:00.860 --> 05:01.790
very easily.

05:01.820 --> 05:02.510
OK.

05:02.630 --> 05:05.180
So that becomes negatively charged.

05:05.180 --> 05:11.090
OK so we're gonna have access negative charge over here on this PDC pipe and then I bring it close to

05:11.090 --> 05:13.240
an aluminum can which is really neutral.

05:13.240 --> 05:13.470
Right.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.940
It has the same number of positives and negatives.

05:15.950 --> 05:16.130
Right.

05:16.130 --> 05:20.440
It has all these aluminum atoms just right next to each other.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.520
However it is kind of a conducting material.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.060
Right.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.050
And the electrons actually are able to move.

05:27.050 --> 05:31.910
So imagine now you bring this negatively charged object if you bring it closer.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.230
OK if I bring it closer.

05:34.270 --> 05:35.520
Well what happens.

05:35.610 --> 05:35.780
Right.

05:35.810 --> 05:39.710
Imagine initially we had kind of electrons.

05:39.710 --> 05:44.300
And again it's only the electrons that moves I'm only going to draw the electrons but clearly there

05:44.300 --> 05:47.210
is also positive charges for each one of those.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.870
Let's just draw both of them.

05:49.990 --> 05:50.310
All right.

05:50.330 --> 05:53.620
Just imagine this can here made up of only a few atoms.

05:53.630 --> 05:53.830
All right.

05:53.930 --> 05:54.620
So what happens.

05:54.620 --> 06:01.970
Well as you bring this closer we know now that these negative charges on the PDC pipe are going to repel

06:01.970 --> 06:05.300
the negative charges of the aluminum can.

06:05.300 --> 06:05.570
Right.

06:05.570 --> 06:10.360
And what's going to happen is these guys here are basically going to move.

06:10.390 --> 06:16.010
Now some of them are kind of closer to the atoms to the positive protons of the aluminum.

06:16.040 --> 06:16.960
So they're going to stay there.

06:16.970 --> 06:20.630
But there are some electrons that want to move away from it.

06:20.660 --> 06:20.890
Right.

06:20.900 --> 06:24.630
Because they get repelled by these negative charges.

06:24.680 --> 06:27.220
So when they move away from it what happens then.

06:27.300 --> 06:31.840
Well we've got to get rid of some of these excess electrons on this side.

06:32.840 --> 06:41.840
And what we're left with then is this picture of excess positive charges on this side fewer Oh I lost

06:41.840 --> 06:42.470
my can.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.110
Let's try.

06:43.190 --> 06:45.060
Let's try this.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.100
And we have a net positive charge over here.

06:49.160 --> 06:53.480
I'm going to add extra electrons because some of the electrons that were closer on this side end up

06:53.480 --> 06:55.000
moving on this side.

06:55.130 --> 06:55.760
Right.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.490
So what happens over here for this can.

06:57.490 --> 07:06.470
So this side of the CAN side that's far away is becomes more negative and the side over here that's

07:06.470 --> 07:08.750
closest to the PDC rod.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.030
This guy here becomes more positive

07:14.240 --> 07:16.550
always that mean in terms of the forces now.

07:16.630 --> 07:18.710
I think about all the forces involved.

07:18.710 --> 07:24.950
Each one of these charges interacts with every charge over here but as a whole you get kind of all of

07:24.950 --> 07:30.800
these negative charges which are going to interact with these ones that's a attractive force on the

07:30.800 --> 07:34.190
can f this way.

07:34.190 --> 07:41.540
And there's also a repulsive force from this PDC pipe to the excess negative charges over here however

07:42.200 --> 07:45.440
that force might draw like this.

07:45.470 --> 07:51.430
This is the other force right from the repulsive force between the charges.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.650
However this vector is smaller than this one.

07:54.930 --> 07:55.210
Right.

07:55.210 --> 08:00.300
And the reason that it's smaller is simply due to the distance.

08:00.310 --> 08:00.870
All right.

08:00.940 --> 08:03.780
This distance over here is small.

08:03.790 --> 08:04.080
OK.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.320
Small distance we saw from cool Ohm's Law.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.480
Small distance equals a bigger force.

08:11.530 --> 08:18.170
So the net force on the can then has to be in this direction.

08:18.270 --> 08:22.020
There is no way for me to take this pipe into actually repel the can.

08:22.020 --> 08:26.260
It's always going to be attractive when I bring the pipe on the other side.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.680
Again the electrons just want to get away from it.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.770
So they kind of move to the other side of the car.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.110
And the ones that can.

08:32.160 --> 08:40.150
Some of these electrons are free electrons are not bound not tightly bound to the positives of the aluminum.

08:40.260 --> 08:41.960
The aluminum atoms.

08:41.970 --> 08:42.200
All right.

08:42.210 --> 08:50.190
So that's kind of the simple explanation as to why this can is always attracted to this PDC pipe and

08:50.190 --> 08:54.510
you can control its motion just by moving the BBC pipe from one side to the other.
