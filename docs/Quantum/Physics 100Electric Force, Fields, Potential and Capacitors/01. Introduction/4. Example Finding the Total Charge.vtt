00:00.120 --> 00:04.860
I've got to kind of short problems over here and they're both involve kind of finding the charge or

00:04.860 --> 00:06.500
the total number of charge.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.990
So in the first case here I have an object that has two point three million protons.

00:13.020 --> 00:18.300
Okay so two point three million and we want to find what is the total charge.

00:18.360 --> 00:24.780
So here I would just simply use my equation that the total charge was from the previous lecture over

00:24.780 --> 00:26.400
here it's two point three million.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.120
So it's always n multiplied by the charge of each proton.

00:30.180 --> 00:32.110
That's the elementary charge.

00:32.130 --> 00:37.740
So in this case little end is two point three multiplied by ten to the six.

00:37.740 --> 00:39.750
That's to get my million okay.

00:39.840 --> 00:47.630
And the charge of each one of these little guys is one point six multiplied by ten to the negative 19.

00:47.740 --> 00:48.810
Cool homes.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.060
Okay.

00:49.080 --> 00:52.320
So at the end all you have to do is do this multiplication.

00:52.330 --> 00:53.740
I'm want to do that one of my calculator.

00:53.740 --> 00:55.680
So two point three.

00:55.680 --> 01:05.130
Each of the six times one point six either the negative nine teen at the end I get three point six eight

01:05.490 --> 01:12.250
multiplied by ten to the negative thirteen and that should be also measured in columns.

01:12.270 --> 01:15.420
So this would be the total charge of this object.

01:15.600 --> 01:16.280
Okay.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.090
Pretty straightforward.

01:18.090 --> 01:19.680
Let's do an arrow here.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.780
Connect that one now would be the charge of this guy.

01:22.320 --> 01:22.530
All right.

01:22.530 --> 01:27.930
How about example number two I'm told that this object over here which kind of has a weird shape has

01:27.930 --> 01:33.780
a total charge of minus four this letter MEU refers to micro cool home.

01:33.840 --> 01:40.110
So if you're going to write micro you would write it as negative four times 10 to the negative six columns.

01:40.140 --> 01:40.340
Okay.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.940
That's the total charge of this object.

01:42.210 --> 01:46.540
So how many electrons would be present here in this object.

01:46.590 --> 01:46.890
All right.

01:46.920 --> 01:53.160
So again we're gonna use the same equation here that I previously used except this time what do I know.

01:53.160 --> 01:58.560
Well I know the total charge in this case and all I want to do is I want to find out what little Ed

01:58.560 --> 01:59.150
is.

01:59.200 --> 02:05.730
OK so from using that equation you should build the right that little N is equal to the total charge

02:07.680 --> 02:13.210
and divided by again the elementary charge or the charge of each electron.

02:13.210 --> 02:13.640
OK.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.280
So again here I'm gonna have negative e right.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.530
I'm going to have negative e because I'm dividing by the charge of each electron.

02:20.580 --> 02:27.060
So in this case I would have minus four times 10 to the negative sixth total charge divided by the charge

02:27.060 --> 02:27.940
of each guy.

02:27.960 --> 02:33.480
Which is one point six times ten of the negative 19 charge of each electron is negative.

02:33.480 --> 02:38.670
So I have that negative there at the end the number should always be a positive value.

02:38.760 --> 02:44.730
So a little N for this specific object here let me do this one in my calculator that's for either the

02:44.730 --> 02:56.850
negative six divided by one point six e of the negative nineteen at the end I get 2.5 times 10 to the

02:57.770 --> 03:03.570
thirteen it's a very very large number and that is measured that's just the number of electrons at the

03:03.570 --> 03:07.880
end I would simply write electrons right here okay.

03:08.190 --> 03:13.230
Anyway so to short examples just to show you how to use my equation here in the red box that the total

03:13.230 --> 03:17.490
charge is always an integer number of elementary charges.
