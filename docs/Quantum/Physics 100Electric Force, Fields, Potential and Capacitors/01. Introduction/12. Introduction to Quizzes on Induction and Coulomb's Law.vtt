All right guys it's now time for you to practice a couple problems so I have two quizzes.

00:05.580 --> 00:10.950
The first is on charging by induction and the second one is on cool Ohm's Law.

00:10.950 --> 00:14.880
They are more conceptual questions or short questions.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.370
All right they're not very long they're multiple choice.

00:17.370 --> 00:19.920
Some of them involve some small calculations.

00:19.920 --> 00:20.290
OK.

00:20.370 --> 00:21.170
So go ahead.

00:21.180 --> 00:25.470
There are two PDA F's that are attached to this video here.

00:25.650 --> 00:26.520
Have a look at them.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.780
Try them out for yourself.

00:27.790 --> 00:30.550
Then look at the video solutions and the explanations.

00:30.600 --> 00:35.010
Make sure you understand these two concepts because they're going to be really important moving forward.

00:35.010 --> 00:35.970
All right let's get started.
