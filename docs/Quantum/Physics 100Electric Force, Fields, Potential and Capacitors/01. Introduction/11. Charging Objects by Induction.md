# Charging Objects by Induction

## 01. Introduction

### Tóm tắt nội dung

The other way that you can actually điện tích an object is through something called induction. OK. Vậy let's start with the figure here at the top. chúng ta có here is a kind of a metal hình cầu. Vậy I mean just write this down metal hình cầu and first of all it is a neutral. Vậy it has the same number of positives and negatives. OK. It's also not sitting on the ground here Đúng. This here is a piece of glass or something that is a not a chất dẫn điện. OK. As long as this piece you that's supporting it is non conducting Đúng we say it's kind of an chất cách điện OK. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that whatever các điện tích are here are kind of stuck on the hình cầu. Được rồi and Figure B what you do here imagine I bring my PDC Rod here that I've rubbed with the rabbit pelt and it's negatively charged again. Bây giờ it's kind of the same picture as the can. Đúng. Can we had those electrons that moved to the other side of the can is shown over here and the positive ones are over here and that's fine. Vậy there is a little bit of an attractive lực here between the rod and the metal hình cầu. Well that's all fine and dandy. Bây giờ this is not going to move because it's kind of stuck to the ground down here. Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ imagine we connected a wire as connected from the hình cầu and goes all the way to the ground and we repeat the same experiment. What điều đó có nghĩa là is Bây giờ the electrons instead of piling up here on the opposite side of the hình cầu. We Bây giờ give them a path to actually leave the mặt of the hình cầu. OK. Vậy they're actually leaving and going to the ground the ground can accept a lot of các điện tích. And then what we remove while we remove that we remove that wire OK. We remove the wire and then if we remove the rod. Well what happens. Vậy a couple of things. Vậy all those electrons that were on the other side of the hình cầu went through that wire and they ended up on the ground. Vậy the ground becomes slightly negatively charged. OK. And you could see that down here. And then once you remove the rod again what you're going to end up getting here is a positively charged hình cầu at the end. OK. It becomes positively charged. Bây giờ these pictures a little bit misleading these các điện tích are not physically moving. It's just the total điện tích of the object Bây giờ will become because of the electron motion and they go back to some equilibrium configuration at the end. The object will become positively charged. OK. Vậy at Không point did the actual rod touch the hình cầu. Vậy that's really important. Yeah. And this is what is called charging by induction. This is how we would obtain a positively charged object. OK. Remember it's only the electrons that can move. That's really really important. The positive các điện tích do not move.
