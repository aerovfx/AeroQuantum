# Coulomb's Law Example Problem 1

## 01. Introduction

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ what we want to do is we want to apply cool Ohm's law to cases where chúng ta có more than two point các điện tích. The first problem here that I'm going to look at we're going to have three point các điện tích there all along the x axis and I've given you the magnitudes of those three point các điện tích in a second problem I have the same three các điện tích. However Bây giờ they're in the x y mặt phẳng. It's kind of like a two dimensional problem. Vậy how would that change how we apply cool Ohm's Law to this particular problem. Được Vậy let's go ahead and solve both of these problems Được rồi. Vậy here's my first problem My goal is to find out what is the net lực tác dụng lên this điện tích Q3. Vậy let me go ahead and kind of just draw it over here here's Q3 Đúng here and Q3 is negative saying go ahead and maybe just remind myself that's a negative điện tích here. Được rồi. Vậy let's go ahead and get started. Vậy cool Ohm's law you might see a rate like this k q a QB divided by our bình phương R bình phương or r rather is the khoảng cách between the two các điện tích a and b Sometimes It's written with a different hằng số in the front instead of this value K is sometimes written as one over for Pi Epsilon 0. And that's OK if that's what's done in your textbook. The only thing to realize is that that value K is actually equal to one over for Pi Epsilon 0. And if you substitute the numbers you look this up in your textbook you say look this substitute everything in your calculator you should get nine times tend to the nine in the units four that are going to be Newton's meters bình phương per Coolum bình phương. And you need those units in order to have Newtons for the lực at the end of the day. Được rồi. Vậy how do you find the lực. Well let's first look at them in pairs cool Ohm's Law works with two các điện tích at a time. Vậy chúng ta có to do is if we're looking for the total lực on Q3 Well there's going to be an interaction between Q3 and Q1. Vậy let's go ahead and draw what is the hướng of that lực between Q1 and Q3. Q1 is a positive điện tích and Q3 is a negative điện tích which means they are attracted to each other. Vậy if I go ahead and draw the lực điều đó có nghĩa là Q3 wants to get closer to Q1. There is an attractive lực there. Vậy we're going to go ahead and we're going to call this fourth F one. Vậy the hướng has to be to the left because it's attracted to Q1. Được rồi what else do chúng ta có. We also have an interaction here between the điện tích Q2 which is negative and the điện tích Q3 which is also negative. Vậy if I'm looking at all the các lực tác dụng lên Q3 điều đó có nghĩa là it's also trying to be being repelled by Q2. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là over here I should probably have another lực and I'm going to label this one F2. Vậy this is interaction of Q2 and Q3. Được rồi let's remind ourselves that this here is the điện tích Q3. Vậy Bây giờ the only thing that's left is chúng ta có to find how big those two các lực are. Vậy let's go ahead and do that. Vậy the fourth F one in order to find its độ lớn. Well all you have to do Bây giờ is use Coombs law. Vậy f 1 is going to be equal to let's use this first phương trình over here. K is our hằng số nine times tend to the 9. Our first điện tích here we're going to call it Q1 our second điện tích Bây giờ is going to be the điện tích Q3 the one we're interested in and Bây giờ it's divided by r bình phương and our bình phương is the khoảng cách between both of those các điện tích. If I look on the figure here it would be the khoảng cách between this guy and Q3. Vậy let's go ahead and call this a khoảng cách here. D 1. Được. Vậy I have to add this to Coombs law D1 bình phương. Được rồi. Vậy all you have to do Bây giờ is substitute in all the values. Vậy for K we get nine times tend to the nine. I'm not going to write the units. Q One is listed over here is five micro cool alone that's five times 10 to the negative 6 if I want to convert into columns $Q_3$ you know Q3 is negative 2. Được rồi. Micro cool. I'm actually just going to write as to micro Coolum I'm gonna drop the negative sign because the negative sign here is only going to tell me something about the hướng of the lực but we know the hướng of the lực because one điện tích is positive in the other one is negative. Vậy there is Không real reason to put negative signs here if you're looking at interaction between point các điện tích we automatically know the hướng of the lực just by looking at. Are they both positive is one positive and the other one's negative. Được rồi. And Bây giờ we also have to divide by the khoảng cách bình phương. Bây giờ Trong trường hợp này this is the khoảng cách between Q1 and Q3. If I look down at the figure I've given you some distances here you should see that this khoảng cách should be zero point six zero point six meters. And I have to square that value Được rồi Bây giờ be a little bit careful when you enter this in the calculator. I did this and hopefully I did it correctly at the end I get to zero point to five Newtons. Bây giờ if you kept the negative sign here you would get a negative zero point two five Newtons but negative simply tell me tells me that the lực is attractive. OK. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that this lực here is zero point to five Newtons and it's pointing to the left. Được rồi. Bây giờ chúng ta có to find the độ lớn of this other lực. Vậy let's go ahead and we're going to apply cool Ohm's law yet again. Vậy again Bây giờ Trong trường hợp này it's K the two các điện tích you're acting Bây giờ or Q2 and Q3 Q2 Q3 and Bây giờ it's going to be divided by a different khoảng cách. Đúng. The khoảng cách is much smaller. Vậy we're going to call this D2 D2 and I have to square that value. Được rồi let's go ahead and substitute in all the values Vậy we get nine times tend to the nine for our K hằng số Q Q2 has a độ lớn of negative 3. Again I'm not too worried about the độ lớn that tells me the hướng of the lực. Tend to the negative 6 because we're dealing with micro columns 2 3 still the same 2 times tend to the negative 6. And Bây giờ I have to divide by this khoảng cách this khoảng cách is zero point two and I have to square that value you place everything in your calculator again. Trong trường hợp này here I got a stronger lực I got one point three five Newtons as the độ lớn of EF 2 Let's go ahead and write this on the figure. Vậy we get one point three five here and I get a véctơ that is zero point two five Newtons pointing to the left for the red one and that's it. All you have to do Bây giờ is find what is the net lực you can tell just by looking at this that the net lực is going to have to point to the Đúng hand side. Được rồi. Again my goal was định nghĩa f net the definition of f net as a véctơ means you have to add up all of the các lực tác dụng lên the điện tích Trong trường hợp này I have two of them. OK. Vậy what I'm going to do Bây giờ is I'm going to assume that everything pointing to the Đúng hand side is going to be a positive lực and everything pointing to the left hand side is going to be a negative lực. Vậy at the end if you want to add both of these up I would say there is a positive one point three five Newton lực acting to the Đúng and there is a negative zero point to five Newton lực acting to the left. Vậy my net lực at the end of the day simply have to evaluate both of those. My net lực at the end should be one point one Newtons in the hướng since it's a positive value the hướng of the lực has to be like this. This is the hướng of f net it's in the same hướng as the lực F two. Được Vậy there's a nice simple application of cool Ohm's law when there's more than two các điện tích. Let's go ahead and look at problem number two Bây giờ.
