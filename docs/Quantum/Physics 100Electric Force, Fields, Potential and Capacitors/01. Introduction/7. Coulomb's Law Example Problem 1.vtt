00:00.150 --> 00:00.350
All right.

00:00.360 --> 00:05.400
So now what we want to do is we want to apply cool Ohm's law to cases where we have more than two point

00:05.400 --> 00:06.640
charges.

00:06.690 --> 00:11.910
The first problem here that I'm going to look at we're going to have three point charges there all along

00:11.910 --> 00:17.370
the x axis and I've given you the magnitudes of those three point charges in a second problem I have

00:17.370 --> 00:18.630
the same three charges.

00:18.630 --> 00:21.650
However now they're in the x y plane.

00:21.650 --> 00:23.400
It's kind of like a two dimensional problem.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.700
So how would that change how we apply cool Ohm's Law to this particular problem.

00:27.810 --> 00:31.410
Okay so let's go ahead and solve both of these problems all right.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.440
So here's my first problem My goal is to find out what is the net force acting on this charge Q3.

00:36.480 --> 00:42.670
So let me go ahead and kind of just draw it over here here's Q3 right here and Q3 is negative saying

00:42.720 --> 00:47.030
go ahead and maybe just remind myself that's a negative charge here.

00:47.040 --> 00:47.360
All right.

00:47.370 --> 00:48.660
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:48.660 --> 00:54.870
So cool Ohm's law you might see a rate like this k q a QB divided by our Squared R squared or r rather

00:54.870 --> 01:00.900
is the distance between the two charges a and b Sometimes It's written with a different constant in

01:00.900 --> 01:05.990
the front instead of this value K is sometimes written as one over for Pi Epsilon 0.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.890
And that's OK if that's what's done in your textbook.

01:09.900 --> 01:16.790
The only thing to realize is that that value K is actually equal to one over for Pi Epsilon 0.

01:16.860 --> 01:22.170
And if you substitute the numbers you look this up in your textbook you say look this substitute everything

01:22.170 --> 01:27.240
in your calculator you should get nine times tend to the nine in the units four that are going to be

01:27.250 --> 01:31.530
Newton's meters squared per Coolum squared.

01:31.530 --> 01:35.460
And you need those units in order to have Newtons for the force at the end of the day.

01:35.520 --> 01:35.730
All right.

01:35.730 --> 01:37.350
So how do you find the force.

01:37.350 --> 01:42.630
Well let's first look at them in pairs cool Ohm's Law works with two charges at a time.

01:42.630 --> 01:48.270
So we have to do is if we're looking for the total force on Q3 Well there's going to be an interaction

01:48.270 --> 01:50.910
between Q3 and Q1.

01:50.910 --> 01:56.650
So let's go ahead and draw what is the direction of that force between Q1 and Q3.

01:56.790 --> 02:03.740
Q1 is a positive charge and Q3 is a negative charge which means they are attracted to each other.

02:03.750 --> 02:08.640
So if I go ahead and draw the force that means Q3 wants to get closer to Q1.

02:08.790 --> 02:10.410
There is an attractive force there.

02:10.410 --> 02:14.010
So we're going to go ahead and we're going to call this fourth F one.

02:14.130 --> 02:18.930
So the direction has to be to the left because it's attracted to Q1.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.110
All right what else do we have.

02:20.160 --> 02:27.180
We also have an interaction here between the charge Q2 which is negative and the charge Q3 which is

02:27.210 --> 02:28.900
also negative.

02:28.920 --> 02:35.520
So if I'm looking at all the forces acting on Q3 that means it's also trying to be being repelled by

02:35.520 --> 02:36.630
Q2.

02:36.720 --> 02:43.300
So that means over here I should probably have another force and I'm going to label this one F2.

02:43.380 --> 02:47.410
So this is interaction of Q2 and Q3.

02:47.430 --> 02:50.820
All right let's remind ourselves that this here is the charge Q3.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.740
So now the only thing that's left is we have to find how big those two forces are.

02:55.740 --> 02:56.820
So let's go ahead and do that.

02:58.020 --> 03:00.840
So the fourth F one in order to find its magnitude.

03:01.830 --> 03:04.280
Well all you have to do now is use Coombs law.

03:04.410 --> 03:09.030
So f 1 is going to be equal to let's use this first equation over here.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.180
K is our constant nine times tend to the 9.

03:12.300 --> 03:19.950
Our first charge here we're going to call it Q1 our second charge now is going to be the charge Q3 the

03:19.950 --> 03:27.000
one we're interested in and now it's divided by r squared and our squared is the distance between both

03:27.000 --> 03:28.440
of those charges.

03:28.500 --> 03:33.870
If I look on the figure here it would be the distance between this guy and Q3.

03:33.870 --> 03:36.050
So let's go ahead and call this a distance here.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.600
D 1.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.130
Okay.

03:38.190 --> 03:43.250
So I have to add this to Coombs law D1 squared.

03:43.770 --> 03:44.010
All right.

03:44.010 --> 03:46.740
So all you have to do now is substitute in all the values.

03:46.730 --> 03:49.670
So for K we get nine times tend to the nine.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.510
I'm not going to write the units.

03:51.790 --> 03:58.560
Q One is listed over here is five micro cool alone that's five times 10 to the negative 6 if I want

03:58.560 --> 04:04.470
to convert into columns Q 3 you know Q3 is negative 2.

04:04.500 --> 04:04.840
All right.

04:05.070 --> 04:05.870
Micro cool.

04:05.930 --> 04:12.510
I'm actually just going to write as to micro Coolum I'm gonna drop the negative sign because the negative

04:12.510 --> 04:18.150
sign here is only going to tell me something about the direction of the force but we know the direction

04:18.150 --> 04:22.170
of the force because one charge is positive in the other one is negative.

04:22.170 --> 04:27.690
So there is no real reason to put negative signs here if you're looking at interaction between point

04:27.690 --> 04:31.950
charges we automatically know the direction of the force just by looking at.

04:31.950 --> 04:35.670
Are they both positive is one positive and the other one's negative.

04:35.670 --> 04:35.980
All right.

04:36.030 --> 04:39.540
And now we also have to divide by the distance squared.

04:39.570 --> 04:43.540
Now in this case this is the distance between Q1 and Q3.

04:43.620 --> 04:48.720
If I look down at the figure I've given you some distances here you should see that this distance should

04:48.720 --> 04:52.470
be zero point six zero point six meters.

04:52.470 --> 04:58.450
And I have to square that value all right now be a little bit careful when you enter this in the calculator.

04:58.650 --> 05:04.700
I did this and hopefully I did it correctly at the end I get to zero point to five Newtons.

05:04.790 --> 05:09.850
Now if you kept the negative sign here you would get a negative zero point two five Newtons but negative

05:09.870 --> 05:13.200
simply tell me tells me that the force is attractive.

05:13.660 --> 05:14.070
OK.

05:14.090 --> 05:19.740
So that means that this force here is zero point to five Newtons and it's pointing to the left.

05:19.890 --> 05:20.100
All right.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.550
Now we have to find the magnitude of this other force.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.360
So let's go ahead and we're going to apply cool Ohm's law yet again.

05:27.360 --> 05:35.790
So again now in this case it's K the two charges you're acting now or Q2 and Q3 Q2 Q3 and now it's going

05:35.790 --> 05:37.860
to be divided by a different distance.

05:37.860 --> 05:38.120
Right.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.380
The distance is much smaller.

05:40.380 --> 05:45.300
So we're going to call this D2 D2 and I have to square that value.

05:45.300 --> 05:50.370
All right let's go ahead and substitute in all the values so we get nine times tend to the nine for

05:50.370 --> 05:55.250
our K constant Q Q2 has a magnitude of negative 3.

05:55.260 --> 05:59.670
Again I'm not too worried about the magnitude that tells me the direction of the force.

06:00.330 --> 06:06.000
Tend to the negative 6 because we're dealing with micro columns 2 3 still the same 2 times tend to the

06:06.000 --> 06:07.380
negative 6.

06:07.380 --> 06:13.230
And now I have to divide by this distance this distance is zero point two and I have to square that

06:13.230 --> 06:16.580
value you place everything in your calculator again.

06:16.740 --> 06:24.670
In this case here I got a stronger force I got one point three five Newtons as the magnitude of EF 2

06:25.110 --> 06:26.780
Let's go ahead and write this on the figure.

06:26.820 --> 06:35.400
So we get one point three five here and I get a vector that is zero point two five Newtons pointing

06:35.400 --> 06:38.420
to the left for the red one and that's it.

06:38.490 --> 06:44.070
All you have to do now is find what is the net force you can tell just by looking at this that the net

06:44.070 --> 06:48.410
force is going to have to point to the right hand side.

06:48.500 --> 06:48.720
All right.

06:48.720 --> 06:57.750
Again my goal was define f net the definition of f net as a vector means you have to add up all of the

06:57.750 --> 07:02.620
forces acting on the charge in this case I have two of them.

07:03.100 --> 07:03.390
OK.

07:03.420 --> 07:10.140
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to assume that everything pointing to the right hand side is

07:10.140 --> 07:15.030
going to be a positive force and everything pointing to the left hand side is going to be a negative

07:15.030 --> 07:15.940
force.

07:15.940 --> 07:20.910
So at the end if you want to add both of these up I would say there is a positive one point three five

07:20.910 --> 07:29.850
Newton force acting to the right and there is a negative zero point to five Newton force acting to the

07:29.850 --> 07:30.940
left.

07:31.020 --> 07:38.310
So my net force at the end of the day simply have to evaluate both of those.

07:38.310 --> 07:44.870
My net force at the end should be one point one Newtons in the direction since it's a positive value

07:44.880 --> 07:47.630
the direction of the force has to be like this.

07:47.700 --> 07:53.660
This is the direction of f net it's in the same direction as the force F two.

07:54.520 --> 07:59.250
Okay so there's a nice simple application of cool Ohm's law when there's more than two charges.

07:59.340 --> 08:01.170
Let's go ahead and look at problem number two now.
