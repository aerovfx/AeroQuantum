# The Atom

## 01. Introduction

### Tóm tắt nội dung

OK Vậy our universe is made up of atoms. OK. Vậy let's have a look at. Vậy all atoms are made up of kind of three different kind of parts. chúng ta có positive các điện tích and the positive các điện tích are usually in the nucleus. That's kind of the center of the atoms. OK. And they're surrounded by these tiny little electrons and you can think of it as a cloud of electrons OK. If you want to xem xét as a point particle kind of circulating in some orbit that's also OK for Bây giờ but it's more of a cloud. There's a kind of a probability distribution that electrons are somewhere in space. OK. Vậy chúng ta có electrons protons and we also have neutrons. OK. Vậy one thing that we're going to see a lot here is that the điện tích OK the điện tích of these tiny little guys Well for Bây giờ we're just going to say that the protons are going to be positive. We'll see a little bit later what they're charged các điện tích it's actually written down here. But in the điện tích of electrons are negative. OK. And neutrons have zero điện tích OK. Vậy these are the basic constituents of atoms. Actually if you have a look at the size of atoms if this kind of black line here represents a 1 Angstrom. OK. If you remember what an angstrom is is ten to the negative 10 meters. OK. That is one Angstrom it's a way way smaller Đúng the center of a helium atom is kind of this little pink and purple dot down over here. And this is actually to the size you're going to Đúng a size down. It would be at the Fermi meter. OK Fermi meter effect is actually a fem dough meter I'm sorry a phantom meter is ten to the negative 15 meters. OK. Vậy they are really really small. OK. Vậy you could see kind of zooming in here that the nucleus. This is an example of a helium atom. Vậy we actually would have two protons This is more of the pink center over here and the black kind of cloud around it. These would represent it's two electrons Vậy they are very very far away from the center Đúng relative to the size of the nucleus Đúng. They could actually be very very far away.
