00:00.090 --> 00:01.620
All right, here's quiz number.

00:02.580 --> 00:03.660
Number two, I guess.

00:04.080 --> 00:04.440
Sorry.

00:04.470 --> 00:05.730
It's on cool Ohm's Law.

00:06.270 --> 00:11.700
All right, so we have two tiny beads that are 25 centimeters apart and no other charges or fields are

00:11.700 --> 00:12.120
present.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.340
BD carries ten micro coulomb, so you just draw it over here.

00:18.490 --> 00:19.240
A and B.

00:20.230 --> 00:20.580
All right.

00:20.590 --> 00:22.840
So this guy here has ten micro Coulomb.

00:24.010 --> 00:26.080
And this guy here has one micro coulomb.

00:26.080 --> 00:27.940
So smaller amount of charge over here.

00:28.360 --> 00:35.330
Which of the following statements is true about the magnitudes of the electric forces on the beads?

00:35.350 --> 00:37.480
Okay, so we want to know the force.

00:37.480 --> 00:39.220
So this is given by cool Ohm's Law, right?

00:39.490 --> 00:48.100
The magnitude of the force, remember, is K, it'll be Q, A, Q B and divided by the distance R squared.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.900
If you were going to draw the vector of the forces over here, both of those are positively charged

00:52.900 --> 00:53.530
objects.

00:53.920 --> 00:55.660
So I would have a force like this.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.500
F And on this guy here, I would have a force f like this.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.920
And what we would know is they would be the same magnitude, right?

01:02.920 --> 01:04.930
It would be the same magnitude of the force.

01:04.930 --> 01:06.700
If this is 100 Newtons.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.380
This one's also 100 Newtons.

01:08.890 --> 01:10.090
So let's have a look at these choices.

01:10.090 --> 01:12.490
The Force A is ten times the force on B?

01:12.490 --> 01:12.940
Nope.

01:13.660 --> 01:14.830
Force B is ten times.

01:14.950 --> 01:15.340
Nope.

01:16.180 --> 01:18.700
It's exactly the same as the force.

01:18.700 --> 01:18.840
Right?

01:18.850 --> 01:24.730
The force have to be the exact same because we only have one way of calculating the force and it's between

01:24.730 --> 01:25.810
the two charges.

01:26.290 --> 01:27.340
So it has to be this.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.600
The force can't be different.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.020
Okay.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.900
This is really Newton's third law at work.

01:32.140 --> 01:34.570
For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.

01:34.930 --> 01:35.290
Okay.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.830
Same magnitude of the force, different direction in on different objects.

01:42.160 --> 01:42.520
All right.

01:43.210 --> 01:47.830
These are all different forces that can't be this the correct answer.

01:48.400 --> 01:48.640
All right.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.320
So make sure you really understand this one.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.580
That's critical, right?

01:51.730 --> 01:55.930
Two objects different charged are going to have the same force acting on them.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.370
All right, let's go.

01:57.370 --> 01:58.130
Scroll down here.

01:58.160 --> 01:58.780
Number two.

02:00.080 --> 02:00.370
All right.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.360
In outer space, a positive charge.

02:02.380 --> 02:08.950
Q This guy over here is released a near a positive fixed charge big.

02:08.960 --> 02:15.010
Q Okay, so let's just kind of highlight this one is the one that released and the big Q is fixed as

02:15.010 --> 02:16.060
Q moves away.

02:16.060 --> 02:17.710
So let me just draw it in a different position.

02:17.710 --> 02:22.840
Eventually, it's going to be moving this way because these are two positives and there is a force acting

02:22.840 --> 02:23.460
on it, right?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.570
There is a repulsive force, at least acting on it.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.130
There's also a force acting on that one.

02:27.660 --> 02:33.730
What is true about the motion of this little Q over here there may be more than one correct choice.

02:33.730 --> 02:34.840
Okay, so keep that in mind.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.420
So first choice, it will move with a decreasing speed.

02:40.540 --> 02:41.080
Okay?

02:41.380 --> 02:45.120
And all of the other choices have to do with either speed or acceleration.

02:45.130 --> 02:47.830
B says it will move at constant acceleration and so forth.

02:48.040 --> 02:52.950
Increasing acceleration, decreasing acceleration, increasing speed.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.570
Well, let's think about what we do know for sure.

02:55.840 --> 03:02.380
We do know that the force acting between them is Q big Q and divided by this distance squared.

03:02.710 --> 03:08.950
So initially that distance is here, but after a period of time, the distance get bigger, right?

03:09.190 --> 03:12.400
This is our later in time, our two, right?

03:13.270 --> 03:14.890
So our gets bigger.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.590
So what happens to our force?

03:16.600 --> 03:19.720
Because I don't change any of the terms in the numerator.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.020
I don't change k I don't change little Q, I don't change big Q.

03:23.260 --> 03:25.360
All I do is I increase this.

03:25.840 --> 03:32.170
So that means that our force has to get smaller as the distance goes away.

03:32.590 --> 03:36.550
So if I was going to draw this vector here a certain length, that means over here I would have to draw

03:36.550 --> 03:37.750
it a little bit smaller.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.540
Now the force is always in the same direction.

03:40.540 --> 03:46.120
However, right here, let me kind of just give myself a bit more space here and have a look at it.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.280
What happens when the charge is over here?

03:48.280 --> 03:50.170
The distance is even further away.

03:50.410 --> 03:51.040
So guess what?

03:51.040 --> 03:53.050
That force should be even smaller.

03:53.710 --> 04:00.610
Okay, so if the force is getting smaller, what can we say about the acceleration of the object?

04:00.610 --> 04:02.350
Remember, Newton's second law told us this.

04:02.350 --> 04:07.300
If you add up all the forces, they have to be equal to the mass times, the acceleration.

04:07.780 --> 04:12.340
So the acceleration is just this force divided by the mass of this little charge.

04:12.340 --> 04:14.860
Q But we don't change the mass.

04:14.860 --> 04:20.980
We only know that the force is getting smaller, so therefore the acceleration is always going to get

04:20.980 --> 04:21.760
smaller.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.350
Okay?

04:23.350 --> 04:27.190
Now so is the acceleration constant.

04:27.190 --> 04:28.420
Look at the second choice.

04:28.690 --> 04:32.020
It certainly can't be constant because the force is not constant.

04:32.020 --> 04:33.010
So get rid of that one.

04:33.460 --> 04:33.850
Okay.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.000
It will move with increasing acceleration.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.260
Well, that doesn't make sense either.

04:38.260 --> 04:42.790
We just said the force is getting smaller, therefore the acceleration is going to get smaller.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.150
Is it moving with decreasing acceleration?

04:46.420 --> 04:47.530
Absolutely right.

04:47.530 --> 04:53.470
The acceleration over at position one, the initial position is big because the forces big acceleration

04:53.470 --> 04:54.460
is getting smaller.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.080
So this one here is okay.

04:56.290 --> 04:57.310
Nothing wrong with that one.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.950
Now the last two have to do with the speed.

04:59.950 --> 05:05.470
So is the speed going to decrease or is the speed going to increase?

05:05.980 --> 05:09.880
So now we have to think how is acceleration and speed related to each other?

05:10.300 --> 05:15.820
The definition of acceleration is the change of velocity versus the change in time.

05:15.820 --> 05:17.020
Now I put a vector here.

05:17.020 --> 05:19.780
However, things are always in the same direction.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.170
So imagine here if the charge is released.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.080
It's released.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.560
That means that the initial speed is zero.

05:27.310 --> 05:27.860
Okay.

05:28.210 --> 05:29.530
So what happens to this?

05:29.920 --> 05:34.080
Well, think about if I'm accelerating, it means that I am speeding up.

05:34.090 --> 05:38.200
So over here I'm going to have some speed because of the forces always trying to speed it up.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.650
Although the force is getting smaller, it's still trying to speed it up.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.740
And over here, the speed is going to get even bigger.

05:44.740 --> 05:47.950
Although the force is getting smaller, it's always in the same direction.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.770
The acceleration is always in the same direction.

05:51.070 --> 05:53.860
So actually this case here, we actually have two of them.

05:53.860 --> 05:58.270
The speed is certainly not going to decrease ever rate it started had zero that it speeds up.

05:58.840 --> 05:59.260
Okay.

05:59.830 --> 06:01.210
Kind of a little bit tricky with this one.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.620
Also, two correct answers.

06:03.820 --> 06:04.200
All right.

06:04.290 --> 06:11.970
Problem three says a hydrogen nucleus, which has a charge of positive E is situated.

06:11.970 --> 06:12.990
So let's draw it out.

06:13.290 --> 06:20.910
One charge positive E is situated to the left of a carbon nucleus, which has a mass of salt, a charge

06:20.910 --> 06:21.780
of six e.

06:21.780 --> 06:23.040
So let's draw it here.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.580
One, two, three, four, five, six.

06:26.580 --> 06:28.770
All right, which statement is true?

06:29.400 --> 06:36.420
Now, again, they're looking at the electrical force experienced by the hydrogen is to the left, and

06:36.420 --> 06:41.880
the magnitude of the force is equal to the force exerted on the carbon nucleus.

06:42.390 --> 06:42.690
All right.

06:42.690 --> 06:43.960
So let's go have a look at this one.

06:43.960 --> 06:44.520
There's this one here.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.000
Makes sense.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.460
So what's the direction of the force?

06:46.470 --> 06:47.670
Both of these are positive.

06:48.210 --> 06:51.240
So on this hydrogen, we would have a force acting like this.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.450
On the carbon here, we would have a force acting like this.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.390
It's pointing to the left.

06:57.390 --> 06:58.200
So that's true.

06:58.470 --> 07:01.170
And the magnitude of the force equals.

07:01.170 --> 07:04.320
Yeah, both of those forces are the same, so I think that one makes sense.

07:04.950 --> 07:05.910
We'll circle that one.

07:05.910 --> 07:06.930
Let's look at the other ones.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.990
And to the left is greater here.

07:10.990 --> 07:12.310
They say that the force is greater.

07:12.310 --> 07:13.930
We know that's not true here.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.210
They say that the forces like that.

07:17.590 --> 07:22.900
The last one choice says that the force on this guy, on the hydrogen nucleus is to the right.

07:23.140 --> 07:28.000
Well, no, we know that's not true, because the forces the force is repulsive between both of those.

07:28.480 --> 07:28.750
All right.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.670
So that's question three.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.510
Let's go down scroll down to number four.

07:33.160 --> 07:33.400
All right.

07:33.400 --> 07:40.960
Two identical charged spheres are a certain distance apart, and each one experiences an electrostatic

07:40.960 --> 07:42.100
force of magnitude.

07:42.100 --> 07:42.520
F.

07:43.770 --> 07:44.460
So here are the.

07:44.610 --> 07:45.150
Okay.

07:46.530 --> 07:56.040
With time, charge gradually diminishes on both spheres by leaking off when each of the spheres has

07:56.040 --> 07:58.410
lost half its initial charge.

07:58.890 --> 08:01.890
What will the magnitude of the electric force be?

08:01.920 --> 08:02.220
All right.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.740
So this is kind of case one, the straw case one.

08:05.100 --> 08:05.640
Case one.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.290
They're separated by some distance.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.630
And we say there's a force acting on it.

08:09.870 --> 08:10.070
All right.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.690
How much charge do we have here initially?

08:13.020 --> 08:18.930
Well, let's imagine this one here has Q and this one here also has Q.

08:19.410 --> 08:19.800
All right.

08:20.910 --> 08:21.870
What's the second case?

08:21.900 --> 08:22.650
The second case?

08:22.650 --> 08:24.870
Well, what happens to the charge?

08:25.710 --> 08:27.360
The charge goes down, right?

08:27.510 --> 08:30.090
It loses half of its initial charge.

08:30.900 --> 08:37.560
So that means in the final configuration, we have the two things that are the same distance apart.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.440
We haven't moved their distance.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.510
However, the charge now is.

08:42.510 --> 08:45.600
Q over two and Q over two.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.100
So let's imagine cool Ohm's Law for the first case.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.270
So I would write it like this.

08:50.270 --> 08:54.890
K Q Q over r squared.

08:55.130 --> 08:57.110
And you can call this Q1 and Q2.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.040
It really doesn't matter.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.270
Yeah, let's do the more general case.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.750
This would be Q1 and Q2.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.850
They don't have to have the same amount of charge.

09:05.450 --> 09:09.470
And that means that this one here would be Q one over two and this wouldn't be Q2 over two.

09:10.160 --> 09:10.430
All right.

09:10.430 --> 09:11.450
How would we write down.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.540
Q Ohm's Law for the second case here?

09:13.580 --> 09:20.840
So you'd have K again, it's still over R squared this term here would be Q one over two and this term

09:20.840 --> 09:22.460
here would be Q two over two.

09:23.450 --> 09:27.200
Now at the end, if you multiply reading through, you're going to have two factors of two.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.670
Over here it's actually one fourth and everything else.

09:31.670 --> 09:32.840
Now it looks the same.

09:32.840 --> 09:37.100
It's kq1 Q2 over R squared.

09:38.030 --> 09:42.530
See, the term in the red bracket is exactly this term right here.

09:43.400 --> 09:50.300
So that means that the force in this case, F two, is actually equal to one fourth, the force in the

09:50.300 --> 09:51.050
first case.

09:51.350 --> 09:51.560
All right.

09:51.560 --> 09:55.730
Notice here, we're going to get a smaller force because it's going down.

09:56.390 --> 09:56.810
Okay.

09:57.710 --> 09:58.070
All right.

09:58.070 --> 10:01.460
So what do we get here for one fourth of F?

10:01.460 --> 10:03.380
It's actually question sorry.

10:03.380 --> 10:05.180
Choice C is the best answer.

10:05.180 --> 10:05.420
Okay.

10:05.420 --> 10:06.500
And this one is just one of them.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.310
You have to work out.

10:08.330 --> 10:13.910
Hopefully you understand that if I have each charge, I'm going to make the force one fourth.

10:14.870 --> 10:17.360
All right, let's go look at the next one.

10:18.840 --> 10:19.170
Problem.

10:19.170 --> 10:19.680
Five.

10:20.610 --> 10:21.030
All right.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.380
Two point charges.

10:22.410 --> 10:24.840
Q One are separated by some distance.

10:25.110 --> 10:26.280
You can go ahead and draw that.

10:26.580 --> 10:28.140
Q1 and Q2.

10:31.260 --> 10:33.690
Again, there are some distance are between them.

10:33.690 --> 10:34.500
That's uppercase.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.980
R if the magnitudes of both charges are doubled.

10:38.400 --> 10:45.600
Okay, so we're going to double the charge and their separation is also double what happens to the force.

10:46.380 --> 10:46.650
All right.

10:46.650 --> 10:52.830
Well, let's write down the force would be kq1q2 over R squared.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.840
All right, let's make the changes now.

10:54.870 --> 10:55.140
Right.

10:55.140 --> 10:57.090
So if you make the changes, what happens?

10:57.100 --> 11:04.100
So we're going to still have the same constant K Now we the magnitude of both charges are doubled.

11:04.110 --> 11:06.300
So that means it would become like two times.

11:06.300 --> 11:09.660
Q one over here and it would be two times.

11:09.660 --> 11:12.660
Q Two for this one because I've doubled each charge.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.060
And then what do I do to the distance?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.310
The separation is also double.

11:17.310 --> 11:22.110
So instead of R, I'm going to have twice R, then I square that.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.670
So what you want to do now is you want to take out all the numerical factors, right?

11:26.670 --> 11:29.400
So we're going to have this one, two multiplied by two.

11:29.820 --> 11:30.890
That gives me four.

11:31.770 --> 11:38.670
However you notice this two here is get squared because of cool Ohm's Law and once I square it, another

11:38.670 --> 11:39.600
four comes out.

11:39.960 --> 11:45.240
So at the end these factors of four simply cancel each other out and you're going to be left with the

11:45.240 --> 11:47.130
exact same force equation.

11:48.410 --> 11:55.130
So in this case it actually remains the same is the best choice double both charges and you double the

11:55.130 --> 11:59.030
distance, you actually get the same force.

12:00.260 --> 12:01.550
So make sure you understand these.

12:01.550 --> 12:02.960
I think these are kind of good problems.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.390
I love asking my students these questions.

12:05.780 --> 12:07.640
See if they can understand the equations.

12:08.420 --> 12:08.690
All right.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.570
Two point charges, kind of a similar one here for problem six.

12:11.570 --> 12:13.520
Q1 and Q2 again are separated.

12:13.970 --> 12:14.270
Okay.

12:14.270 --> 12:17.810
Look, in this case, the magnitudes of both charges are halved.

12:18.140 --> 12:19.280
So you make them smaller.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.890
That would make the force smaller.

12:22.610 --> 12:25.100
And their separation is also halved.

12:25.340 --> 12:25.700
Okay.

12:25.700 --> 12:29.840
So you also make the separation half what happens to the electrical force?

12:30.140 --> 12:30.320
All right.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.400
Let's draw the first case.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.080
So it was Q1 and Q2.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.180
And they're separated by.

12:37.180 --> 12:37.540
Ah.

12:37.570 --> 12:38.260
I'll write it out.

12:38.710 --> 12:39.280
Out long.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.040
In this case, the forth between both of them would be okay.

12:43.000 --> 12:43.720
Q one.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.540
Q two divided by our squared.

12:47.440 --> 12:47.710
All right.

12:47.710 --> 12:48.950
Let's do the bottom case.

12:48.970 --> 12:50.380
What do we have the charges?

12:50.380 --> 12:55.270
Half the Q1 over to the charge over here is Q two over two.

12:55.780 --> 12:56.170
Oops.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.790
I didn't make the separation.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.230
I left the separation there.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.330
So the separation should be something like this.

13:02.080 --> 13:02.470
All right.

13:02.890 --> 13:05.290
So let's kind of move this a little closer.

13:06.670 --> 13:06.970
All right.

13:06.970 --> 13:08.870
And now we've got to change the separation.

13:08.890 --> 13:10.390
The separation now is.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.440
Smaller.

13:13.070 --> 13:14.300
It's all over, too.

13:15.170 --> 13:15.410
All right.

13:15.410 --> 13:20.480
How would you write down cool Ohm's Law for the interaction between both of these objects over here?

13:20.510 --> 13:22.130
Well, you'd have my k constant.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.620
You'd have my two charges.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.630
Q one over two.

13:27.810 --> 13:31.590
Q two over two and now divided by the distance.

13:31.590 --> 13:34.050
The distance now is half.

13:35.340 --> 13:39.720
All right, now, again, what you want to do is you want to factor out all of those terms, right?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.540
So you're going to have K.

13:41.580 --> 13:42.480
Q one.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.860
Q two or you're going to have one over four in the numerator, right?

13:47.310 --> 13:48.300
One over four.

13:49.410 --> 13:51.720
But now take a look at the denominator term here.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.900
This becomes R squared over four, right?

13:55.080 --> 13:56.820
You got to square this two right here.

13:57.320 --> 14:02.580
Now, at the end, both of these fours again are going to cancel out and you're going to be left with

14:02.580 --> 14:05.040
the expression that looks exactly the same.

14:05.040 --> 14:05.340
Right?

14:05.340 --> 14:10.770
You're going to be the left that might force even after making all of those changes, it simplifies

14:10.770 --> 14:14.450
to Q1, Q2, over R squared.

14:14.460 --> 14:17.220
All of these other factors have to end up canceling out.

14:18.000 --> 14:18.300
Okay.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.760
So at the end, both of these expressions are the same.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.160
So we have to have choice.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.410
E is the correct answer for this one.

14:26.040 --> 14:26.370
All right.

14:26.370 --> 14:27.390
Great job, everybody.
