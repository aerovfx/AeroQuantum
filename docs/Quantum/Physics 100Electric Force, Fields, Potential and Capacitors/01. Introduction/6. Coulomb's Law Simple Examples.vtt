00:00.120 --> 00:05.700
We have two examples here of applying a cool arms loss on the first example here I want to find what

00:05.700 --> 00:08.700
the forces acting between both of these charges.

00:08.730 --> 00:15.090
So the purple one has a magnitude of zero point one micro cool on the green one here has three micro

00:15.090 --> 00:17.850
cooling so significantly bigger.

00:17.850 --> 00:23.820
So first of all if you were going to draw the direction of the force acting between these charges since

00:23.820 --> 00:28.890
they're both positive you would have the force F acting on this one in that direction.

00:28.890 --> 00:35.400
That would be my vector and again repulsive I would have the exact same magnitude but the force would

00:35.400 --> 00:37.030
be in the opposite direction.

00:37.060 --> 00:37.560
All right.

00:38.070 --> 00:42.510
OK so now what I'm interested in here is what is the magnitude of that force F.

00:42.570 --> 00:50.130
So I'm gonna use my second definition which was K Q1 Q2 and over R squared.

00:50.280 --> 00:50.510
All right.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.580
So now what we have to do is simply substitute our values over here.

00:53.610 --> 00:57.570
So my k VALUE IS NINE TIMES 10 TO THE NINE.

00:57.570 --> 00:59.410
I'M NOT GONNA BOTHER right in the units.

00:59.470 --> 01:02.360
Q1 is the magnitude of one of these guys.

01:02.370 --> 01:07.320
So that's zero point one times ten to the negative six columns.

01:07.470 --> 01:13.940
That's the ten to the negative six is for the micro column and the other one is three.

01:14.130 --> 01:18.710
Three times tend to the negative six micro column.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.330
Now I can't forget to divide by that distance in this case the distance from center to center between

01:24.330 --> 01:27.880
these two point charges is one point five meters.

01:27.930 --> 01:32.100
So it's one point five meters and I have to square that term.

01:32.100 --> 01:32.580
All right.

01:32.580 --> 01:36.300
And that is going to give me the magnitude of this force F.

01:36.790 --> 01:40.490
OK so we're going to put that my calculate I'm going to do right now.

01:40.490 --> 01:46.080
So I'm going to do the one point five squared first and then I take the inverse of that and then I simply

01:46.080 --> 01:48.270
have to multiply by everything in the numerator.

01:48.270 --> 01:59.820
So at times nine either the nine times zero point one e to the negative six equals in times three either

01:59.820 --> 02:02.000
the negative six OK.

02:02.010 --> 02:07.650
If I put everything in the calculator and assuming that I've done things correctly over here I get one

02:07.650 --> 02:13.440
point two times 10 to the negative three and that should be measured in Newton's at the end.

02:13.470 --> 02:13.940
OK.

02:14.130 --> 02:19.610
So that means that this force on this charges one point two times ten to the negative three.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.890
And it's the same as this one just in an opposite direction right.

02:22.890 --> 02:26.120
One point two times 10 to the negative three Newton's.

02:26.280 --> 02:26.520
All right.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.390
Pretty straightforward hopefully.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.360
All right how about this one.

02:29.370 --> 02:34.740
In this case here I've got a negative and a positive and I know that the force acting on those would

02:34.740 --> 02:35.630
be attractive.

02:35.640 --> 02:35.870
Right.

02:35.880 --> 02:40.710
So on the positive one I'd have a force vector that's pointing to the left on the negative charge I'd

02:40.710 --> 02:46.860
have a force vector that's pointing to the right the separation between both of these is given by three

02:46.860 --> 02:47.740
meters.

02:47.850 --> 02:53.610
And in this case I've given us what the forces My question is let's find what the magnitude of the charges

02:53.970 --> 02:57.920
in this case here it's the same magnitude just one of them is positive.

02:58.020 --> 02:59.730
And one of them is negative.

02:59.790 --> 03:02.340
But they're going to be the same magnitude.

03:02.370 --> 03:03.320
So how do we do this.

03:03.330 --> 03:07.110
Well again using cool Ohm's Law I could start off simply by writing it.

03:07.750 --> 03:12.140
K. again it's gonna be q TIMES Q So this is simply Q squared.

03:12.150 --> 03:16.050
If the magnitude is the same in divided by our squared.

03:16.290 --> 03:20.870
So what I'm gonna do is just rearrange is because what I'm trying to find is what the value of Q is.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.750
I can start off by this Q squared.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.730
Bring the r squared on the other side.

03:26.730 --> 03:33.930
R squared and divided by that constant k in at the end to get rid of that square root that a squared

03:33.930 --> 03:40.050
term all I have to do is take the square root on both sides my final expression should look something

03:40.050 --> 03:41.370
like this.

03:41.450 --> 03:48.420
So now I'm gonna start substituting in all my values so my forces three point six Newtons the distance

03:48.420 --> 03:58.650
squared it's three squared and now divided by my constant K which is nine point zero times ten to the

03:58.650 --> 03:59.820
nine.

03:59.830 --> 04:04.210
Okay now let's try to do this one in the calculator again I'm going to do it right now so I'm gonna

04:04.230 --> 04:14.130
get three points six times this term ends up being nine times nine and all of this gets divided by nine

04:14.630 --> 04:16.620
and ten to the nine.

04:16.620 --> 04:19.200
All right now DNA can't forget to take the square root.

04:19.230 --> 04:27.810
So if I take my square root I should get a charge which is six point zero times I get ten to the negative

04:27.810 --> 04:28.490
five.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.900
And again that should be now measured in columns.

04:30.950 --> 04:38.490
Okay so that means that the charge over here should be positive six point zero times ten to the five

04:38.500 --> 04:39.640
columns.

04:39.720 --> 04:45.960
And this guy here would be negative six point zero times ten to the negative five columns.

04:45.980 --> 04:46.420
Okay.

04:46.500 --> 04:52.180
So in this case I'm able to do this because I've actually told you that the magnitude is the same.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.960
If the magnitude wasn't the same I would need some other information because I would have two unknowns.

04:57.090 --> 04:59.950
I would have Q1 and Q2 and columns law.

05:00.070 --> 05:00.430
Okay.

05:00.630 --> 05:06.430
But if the problem tells you that the magnitude is the same you can make the simplification over here.
