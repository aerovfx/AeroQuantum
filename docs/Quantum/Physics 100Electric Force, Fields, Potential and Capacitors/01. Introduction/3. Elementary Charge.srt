00:00.150 --> 00:02.950
So we've seen we have two kinds of charges.

00:03.040 --> 00:05.610
We now want to talk about how big that charges.

00:05.640 --> 00:05.860
OK.

00:05.880 --> 00:11.460
So now we're going to talk about the magnitude of the charge and let's focus on the proton and on the

00:11.460 --> 00:12.570
electron.

00:12.570 --> 00:17.920
So again we've discussed that the difference between the two is that one of them is positive.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.500
And the other one here we say is negatively charged.

00:21.510 --> 00:22.390
All right.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.390
This brings us to something called the elementary charge of the elementary charge the symbol for the

00:27.390 --> 00:29.750
elementary charges the little letter E..

00:29.850 --> 00:30.530
OK.

00:30.600 --> 00:38.350
And its value is one point six multiplied by ten to the negative 19.

00:38.360 --> 00:42.380
Let me clear that up here tend to the negative 19 columns.

00:42.420 --> 00:42.720
OK.

00:42.720 --> 00:55.690
The symbol here this refers to cool homes and this is the S.I. unit for charge a unit for charge.

00:55.700 --> 00:55.910
All right.

00:55.940 --> 00:57.420
So this is super important.

00:57.420 --> 01:05.340
So that means if I have a one proton if I draw one proton over here it would have a charge of I can

01:05.340 --> 01:13.950
write it as positive E that would be the charge of the proton positive one point six times ten to the

01:13.950 --> 01:16.120
negative 19 columns.

01:16.260 --> 01:20.680
If I have one electron draw an electron down over here.

01:20.790 --> 01:22.820
All right I put a little negative sign.

01:22.890 --> 01:28.980
I would write its charge as being well I would go over here and I would write as negative E OK.

01:29.010 --> 01:35.200
And that would be negative one point six times ten to the negative 19 columns.

01:35.610 --> 01:44.240
If I go back and look at my helium for example my helium atom and let's just look at the helium nucleus.

01:44.430 --> 01:46.850
So forget about the electrons only the protons.

01:46.850 --> 01:52.600
So what you would have would be two positive charges that are close to each other.

01:52.710 --> 01:55.170
And if I just kind of just circle around here.

01:55.200 --> 01:55.780
OK.

01:55.950 --> 02:00.170
I would say that the total charge for this helium atom would be well.

02:00.270 --> 02:01.590
So total charge

02:04.660 --> 02:07.240
is simply going to be two multiplied by each.

02:07.270 --> 02:10.790
So it would be three point two loops.

02:10.910 --> 02:15.970
That's three point two and I wrote three point six three point two times 10 to the negative 19.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.070
Cool.

02:17.140 --> 02:17.690
OK.

02:17.740 --> 02:20.650
If you take any object it doesn't matter what it is.

02:20.680 --> 02:20.980
OK.

02:21.030 --> 02:25.300
If I take any object and imagine it's positively charged.

02:25.320 --> 02:30.900
So it has a whole bunch of protons and no electrons so I've stripped away all the electrons that I know

02:30.900 --> 02:32.190
how many we have here.

02:32.680 --> 02:39.190
But the total charge of any object I can write it as q q is usually the letter we use for charge.

02:39.730 --> 02:42.610
And if I write it as Q total.

02:42.610 --> 02:49.660
The important thing is that it's always going to be some number N multiplied by the elementary charge.

02:49.660 --> 02:57.340
Again this is really really important because charge we say is quantized it comes in these packets over

02:57.340 --> 03:04.260
here that are all one point six times ten of the negative 19 and over here should be just a number.

03:04.570 --> 03:06.330
Okay.

03:06.610 --> 03:11.370
Example it could be 15 it could be ten thousand.

03:11.400 --> 03:17.480
Okay it could be whatever two million times tend to the six.

03:17.620 --> 03:22.360
It's simply a number which refers to the number of charges that we have got.

03:22.630 --> 03:27.370
So in this case if you're going to count them all we'd have one two three four five six seven eight

03:27.370 --> 03:29.570
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen.

03:29.590 --> 03:38.350
So in this case little Ed would be 13 and the total charge would simply be 13 multiplied by one point

03:38.350 --> 03:42.940
six times ten to the negative 19 columns.

03:42.940 --> 03:44.340
So at the end the total charge.

03:44.340 --> 03:45.730
Let me use my calculator here.

03:45.730 --> 03:49.480
So 13 times one point six.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.010
Now this gives me 20.

03:53.110 --> 03:57.370
And again point eight times 10 to the negative 19 columns.

03:57.370 --> 04:01.060
That would be the total charge for this object here in green.

04:01.060 --> 04:01.520
All right.

04:01.630 --> 04:07.360
So a couple of important concepts elementary charge and the total charge is always some number multiplied

04:07.360 --> 04:08.800
by that elementary charge.
