# Coulomb's Law

## 01. Introduction

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Vậy let's talk about cool homes Bây giờ cool Ohm's law Bây giờ. Well we're going to first assume is that chúng ta có two small các điện tích usually these are referred to as kind of point các điện tích and they are separated by a certain khoảng cách. Are Vậy are as measured from center to center. We already know the hướng. OK. Vậy we don't have to worry about the hướng of the lực because we just look at it. If there are two positive các điện tích the lực is repelling. If they're two negatives that also repels Vậy hướng of lực is known or Bây giờ interested in is what is the độ lớn. Vậy how big is the lực how big is f. OK and that's given by cool law cool homes law you can write as something like this. The lực is equal to there is a hằng số in the front which is one over for pi. There's this other value here which I'll get to in just a second. And the important stuff is Đúng here. Q1 the độ lớn Q2 the độ lớn I put absolute values in there and divided bytes depends on how far they are. But it's the khoảng cách bình phương. Vậy let's look at this phương trình in just a little bit more detail. Vậy first of all this guy Đúng here Epsilon 0. This is a hằng số. And it's referred to as the permitting city of free space. Vậy all you have to do is open your book and just find its value. OK. Vậy people have kind of measured that and in a value is eight point eight five times 10 to the negative twelve. The units for this again at the end of the day I need to have Newton's on the left hand side of cool Ohm's Law in an order for all that to work out. You're going to need cool loam bình phương. Per Newton in meters square it's something like this. These are going to be the units that I'm going to need if at the end of the day this guy is measured in Newton's because I'll have to cancel cool ohms twice and I'll have to cancel meters bình phương also. This is referred to as a inverse square law. You might have seen the lực of gravity. Đúng. Newton's Law of Gravitation is also an inverse square law which means that its inverse. Vậy the khoảng cách between the các điện tích square it appears in the denominator here. That's why the inverse bình phương law. Được rồi. Bây giờ to simplify things a little bit rather than kind of writing it like this a lot of people just kind of simplify they'll represent everything here in the bracket. And again since that's all one hằng số term you can evaluate that sometimes you rewrite Coombs law the same law will write it like this or write it as F is some other hằng số k. And again everything else is the same Q1 Q2 and again over our bình phương. Trong trường hợp này you could see that this value K is nothing more than one over for Pi Epsilon 0. If you actually take your calculator and evaluate this you should get approximately nine point nine Vậy a nine point zero times ten to the nine. Được. Bây giờ the units are going to be different. Here here we're gonna have units of Newton's meters bình phương per Coolum Square they're actually the inverse of the units of the permitting of free space. Được. Vậy depending on the textbook that you use I kind of like this form is just kind of easier to tính toán. Again it's just a hằng số term and these are the two things are that are important as to các điện tích here in the numerator and khoảng cách bình phương in the denominator. Được. Vậy this tells you how big the các điện tích how big the các lực sorry how big the các lực between both of these các điện tích.
