### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi, here's quiz number. Number two, I guess. Sorry. It's on cool Ohm's Law. Được rồi, Vậy chúng ta có two tiny beads that are 25 centimeters apart and Không other các điện tích or fields are present. BD carries ten micro coulomb, Vậy you just draw it over here. A and B. Được rồi. Vậy this guy here has ten micro Coulomb. And this guy here has one micro coulomb. Vậy smaller amount of điện tích over here. Which of the following statements is true about the magnitudes of the electric các lực on the beads? Được, Vậy we want to know the lực. Vậy this is given by cool Ohm's Law, Đúng? The độ lớn of the lực, remember, is K, it'll be Q, A, Q B and divided by the khoảng cách R bình phương. If you were going to draw the véctơ of the các lực over here, both of those are positively charged objects. Vậy I would have a lực like this. F And on this guy here, I would have a lực f like this. And what we would know is they would be the same độ lớn, Đúng? It would be the same độ lớn of the lực. If this is 100 Newtons. This one's also 100 Newtons. Vậy let's have a look at these choices. The lực A is ten times the lực on B? Nope. lực B is ten times. Nope. It's exactly the same as the lực. Đúng? The lực have to be the exact same because we only have one way of calculating the lực and it's between the two các điện tích. Vậy it has to be this. The lực can't be different. Được. This is really Định luật thứ ba của Newton at work. For every action, there's an bằng nhau và ngược chiều reaction. Được. Same độ lớn of the lực, different hướng in on các vật thể khác nhau. Được rồi. These are all different các lực that can't be this the correct answer. Được rồi. Vậy make sure you really understand this one. That's critical, Đúng? Two objects different charged are going to have the same lực tác dụng lên them. Được rồi, let's go. Scroll down here. Number two. Được rồi. In outer space, a positive điện tích. Q This guy over here is released a near a positive fixed điện tích big. Q Được, Vậy let's just kind of highlight this one is the one that released and the big Q is fixed as Q moves away. Vậy let me just draw it in a different position. Eventually, it's going to be moving this way because these are two positives and there is a lực tác dụng lên it, Đúng? There is a repulsive lực, at least tác dụng lên it. There's also a lực tác dụng lên that one. What is true about the motion of this little Q over here there may be more than one correct choice. Được, Vậy keep that in mind. Vậy first choice, it will move with a decreasing tốc độ. Được? And all of the other choices have to do with either tốc độ or gia tốc. B says it will move at hằng số gia tốc and Vậy forth. Increasing gia tốc, decreasing gia tốc, increasing tốc độ. Well, let's think about what we do know for sure. We do know that the lực acting between them is Q big Q and divided by this khoảng cách bình phương. Vậy initially that khoảng cách is here, but after a period of time, the khoảng cách get bigger, Đúng? This is our later in time, our two, Đúng? Vậy our gets bigger. Vậy what happens to our lực? Because I don't change any of the terms in the numerator. I don't change k I don't change little Q, I don't change big Q. All I do is I increase this. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that our lực has to get smaller as the khoảng cách goes away. Vậy if I was going to draw this véctơ here a certain length, điều đó có nghĩa là over here I would have to draw it a little bit smaller. Bây giờ the lực is always in the same hướng. However, Đúng here, let me kind of just give myself a bit more space here and have a look at it. What happens when the điện tích is over here? The khoảng cách is even further away. Vậy guess what? That lực should be even smaller. Được, Vậy if the lực is getting smaller, what can we say about the gia tốc of the object? Remember, Newton's second law told us this. If you add up all the các lực, they have to be equal to the mass times, the gia tốc. Vậy the gia tốc is just this lực divided by the mass of this little điện tích. Q But we don't change the mass. We only know that the lực is getting smaller, Vậy therefore the gia tốc is always going to get smaller. Được? Bây giờ Vậy is the gia tốc hằng số. Look at the second choice. It certainly can't be hằng số because the lực is not hằng số. Vậy get rid of that one. Được. It will move with increasing gia tốc. Well, that doesn't make sense either. We just said the lực is getting smaller, therefore the gia tốc is going to get smaller. Is it moving with decreasing gia tốc? Absolutely Đúng. The gia tốc over at position one, the initial position is big because the các lực big gia tốc is getting smaller. Vậy this one here is Được. Nothing wrong with that one. Bây giờ the last two have to do with the tốc độ. Vậy is the tốc độ going to decrease or is the tốc độ going to increase? Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có to think how is gia tốc and tốc độ related to each other? The definition of gia tốc is the change of vận tốc versus the change in time. Bây giờ I put a véctơ here. However, things are always in the same hướng. Vậy imagine here if the điện tích is released. It's released. điều đó có nghĩa là that the initial tốc độ is zero. Được. Vậy what happens to this? Well, think about if I'm accelerating, it means that I am speeding up. Vậy over here I'm going to have some tốc độ because of the các lực always trying to tốc độ it up. Although the lực is getting smaller, it's still trying to tốc độ it up. And over here, the tốc độ is going to get even bigger. Although the lực is getting smaller, it's always in the same hướng. The gia tốc is always in the same hướng. Vậy actually this case here, we actually have two of them. The tốc độ is certainly not going to decrease ever rate it started had zero that it speeds up. Được. Kind of a little bit tricky with this one. Also, two correct answers. Được rồi. Problem three says a hydrogen nucleus, which has a điện tích of positive E is situated. Vậy let's draw it out. One điện tích positive E is situated to the left of a carbon nucleus, which has a mass of salt, a điện tích of six e. Vậy let's draw it here. One, two, three, four, five, six. Được rồi, which statement is true? Bây giờ, again, they're looking at the electrical lực experienced by the hydrogen is to the left, and the độ lớn of the lực is equal to the lực exerted on the carbon nucleus. Được rồi. Vậy let's go have a look at this one. There's this one here. Makes sense. Vậy what's the hướng of the lực? Both of these are positive. Vậy on this hydrogen, we would have a lực acting like this. On the carbon here, we would have a lực acting like this. It's pointing to the left. Vậy that's true. And the độ lớn of the lực equals. Yeah, both of those các lực are the same, Vậy I think that one makes sense. We'll circle that one. Let's look at the other ones. And to the left is greater here. They say that the lực is greater. We know that's not true here. They say that the các lực like that. The last one choice says that the lực on this guy, on the hydrogen nucleus is to the Đúng. Well, Không, we know that's not true, because the các lực the lực is repulsive between both of those. Được rồi. Vậy that's question three. Let's go down scroll down to number four. Được rồi. Two identical charged spheres are a certain khoảng cách apart, and each one experiences an electrostatic lực of độ lớn. F. Vậy here are the. Được. With time, điện tích gradually diminishes on both spheres by leaking off when each of the spheres has lost half its initial điện tích. What will the độ lớn of the lực điện be? Được rồi. Vậy this is kind of case one, the straw case one. Case one. They're separated by some khoảng cách. And we say there's a lực tác dụng lên it. Được rồi. How much điện tích do chúng ta có here initially? Well, let's imagine this one here has Q and this one here also has Q. Được rồi. What's the second case? The second case? Well, what happens to the điện tích? The điện tích goes down, Đúng? It loses half of its initial điện tích. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là in the final configuration, chúng ta có the two things that are the same khoảng cách apart. We haven't moved their khoảng cách. However, the điện tích Bây giờ is. Q over two and Q over two. Vậy let's imagine cool Ohm's Law for the first case. Vậy I would write it like this. K Q Q over r bình phương. And you can call this Q1 and Q2. It really doesn't matter. Yeah, let's do the more general case. This would be Q1 and Q2. They don't have to have the same amount of điện tích. And điều đó có nghĩa là that this one here would be Q one over two and this wouldn't be Q2 over two. Được rồi. How would we write down. Q Ohm's Law for the second case here? Vậy you'd have K again, it's still over R bình phương this term here would be Q one over two and this term here would be Q two over two. Bây giờ at the end, if you multiply reading through, you're going to have two factors of two. Over here it's actually one fourth and everything else. Bây giờ it looks the same. It's kq1 Q2 over R bình phương. See, the term in the red bracket is exactly this term Đúng here. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the lực Trong trường hợp này, F two, is actually equal to one fourth, the lực in the first case. Được rồi. Notice here, we're going to get a smaller lực because it's going down. Được. Được rồi. Vậy what do we get here for one fourth of F? It's actually question sorry. Choice C is the best answer. Được. And this one is just one of them. You have to work out. Hopefully you understand that if I have each điện tích, I'm going to make the lực one fourth. Được rồi, let's go look at the next one. Problem. Five. Được rồi. Two point các điện tích. Q One are separated by some khoảng cách. You can go ahead and draw that. Q1 and Q2. Again, there are some khoảng cách are between them. That's uppercase. R if the magnitudes of both các điện tích are doubled. Được, Vậy we're going to double the điện tích and their separation is also double what happens to the lực. Được rồi. Well, let's write down the lực would be kq1q2 over R bình phương. Được rồi, let's make the changes Bây giờ. Đúng. Vậy if you make the changes, what happens? Vậy we're going to still have the same hằng số K Bây giờ we the độ lớn of both các điện tích are doubled. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là it would become like two times. Q one over here and it would be two times. Q Two for this one because I've doubled each điện tích. And then what do I do to the khoảng cách? The separation is also double. Vậy instead of R, I'm going to have twice R, then I square that. Vậy what you want to do Bây giờ is you want to take out all the numerical factors, Đúng? Vậy we're going to have this one, two multiplied by two. That gives me four. However you notice this two here is get bình phương because of cool Ohm's Law and once I square it, another four comes out. Vậy at the end these factors of four simply cancel each other out and you're going to be left with the exact same lực phương trình. Vậy Trong trường hợp này it actually remains the same is the best choice double both các điện tích and you double the khoảng cách, you actually get the same lực. Vậy make sure you understand these. I think these are kind of good problems. I love asking my students these questions. See if they can understand the equations. Được rồi. Two point các điện tích, kind of a similar one here for problem six. Q1 and Q2 again are separated. Được. Look, Trong trường hợp này, the magnitudes of both các điện tích are halved. Vậy you make them smaller. That would make the lực smaller. And their separation is also halved. Được. Vậy you also make the separation half what happens to the electrical lực? Được rồi. Let's draw the first case. Vậy it was Q1 and Q2. And they're separated by. Ah. I'll write it out. Out long. Trong trường hợp này, the forth between both of them would be Được. Q one. Q two divided by our bình phương. Được rồi. Let's do the bottom case. What do chúng ta có the các điện tích? Half the Q1 over to the điện tích over here is Q two over two. Oops. I didn't make the separation. I left the separation there. Vậy the separation should be something like this. Được rồi. Vậy let's kind of move this a little closer. Được rồi. And Bây giờ we've got to change the separation. The separation Bây giờ is. Smaller. It's all over, too. Được rồi. How would you write down cool Ohm's Law for the interaction between both of these objects over here? Well, you'd have my k hằng số. You'd have my two các điện tích. Q one over two. Q two over two and Bây giờ divided by the khoảng cách. The khoảng cách Bây giờ is half. Được rồi, Bây giờ, again, what you want to do is you want to factor out all of those terms, Đúng? Vậy you're going to have K. Q one. Q two or you're going to have one over four in the numerator, Đúng? One over four. But Bây giờ take a look at the denominator term here. This becomes R bình phương over four, Đúng? You got to square this two Đúng here. Bây giờ, at the end, both of these fours again are going to cancel out and you're going to be left with the expression that looks exactly the same. Đúng? You're going to be the left that might lực even after making all of those changes, it simplifies to Q1, Q2, over R bình phương. All of these other factors have to end up canceling out. Được. Vậy at the end, both of these expressions are the same. Vậy chúng ta có to have choice. E is the correct answer for this one. Được rồi. Great job, everybody.
