# Capacitors with Dielectrics

## 07. Capacitors

### Tóm tắt nội dung

I Bây giờ want to xem xét what happens when I play something between the plates of a tụ điện Trong trường hợp này let's just keep the discussion to parallel play capacitors on the material that I'm going to place is something called a chất điện môi and that is just another word for an insulating material. Vậy it's not a chất dẫn điện. You don't want a chất dẫn điện between the các bản song song because then the điện tích is just going to leave. Vậy you want the điện tích to remain there Vậy it has to be a material that doesn't conduct electricity very well. One example of that is rubber. You can have plastic paper wood. Again things that are they don't let the Chargers move across. Được rồi. Bây giờ if I xem xét just this simple case where I have some điện tích on each plate. Được rồi here's the illustration down here in the left figure and I have a way that I've measured the hiệu điện thế between those plates Vậy I use a meter over here and I've charged the plates using a battery and I get a certain reading on that dial the điện dung for this case again. If it's just that parallel plate tụ điện we looked at this phương trình before it's Epsilon 0 a divided by D. Bây giờ the question is what happens when I place this material inside. Well there's always something that happens and the key is that the điện dung C always goes up whatever number I get here when there's nothing between the plates. When I play something between the plates the điện dung always increases it will never go down. Vậy let me write that down điện dung will increase always. Vậy how much does it go. Does it increase by. Well it kind of depends on what you place in that between the các bản song song. Vậy all of these materials are rubber plastic wood. Được. They're all characterized with something called a chất điện môi hằng số. Let me highlight this point. The chất điện môi hằng số is usually given by the letter K or Kappa and it is dimension less it's just the number. Được Vậy this chất điện môi hằng số I mean just write it as K Number One is it's always bigger equal to one if it's air the điện dung sorry the chất điện môi hằng số for air is very very close to one. Vậy that's why it behaves just like this. Vậy when you place the chất điện môi hằng số between the plates the điện dung increases we said and the new điện dung is given by this phương trình. See when there is a chất điện môi inside is equal to the chất điện môi hằng số. Again multiplied by the điện dung when there's nothing between the plates. Vậy I'm gonna call this C0 when there's nothing between the plates. Vậy the new điện dung is written as chất điện môi hằng số multiplied by the value of the điện dung when it's air filled or nothing between the plates. Ok Vậy this is really the key phương trình and again that chất điện môi hằng số is always bigger than one. Which means if I multiply this by the original capacities I'm always going to get something bigger. OK. Vậy why is that. And the other question is kind of what happens to the hiệu điện thế between the plates. You can see here if I kept everything connected and I have some điện tích between the plates. Look what happened to the reading Đúng. We had a hiệu điện thế drop over here Đúng. V went down a little bit. It used to be at the maximum value. Bây giờ it's kind of gone down a little bit and it's going to go down by the chất điện môi hằng số. And to really understand this you really have to look at what's happening to that material when you place it between the plates. Again we talked about this before. And again the atoms although they're neutral they can still spread out Đúng the positives and the negatives are going to go in different directions because there's an điện trường inside that material. Vậy let me draw a kind of one big atom Vậy chúng ta có thể see what's going to happen. It was a neutral atom except the positive side's going to end up here. And the electrons are going to end up closer to the positive plates. Vậy there's charged separation we say there is a polarization Bây giờ. Vậy if you have a look at it Bây giờ. Vậy we had a hiệu điện thế between the plates. However look what happens Đúng chúng ta có the hiệu điện thế which is due to both of those. However Bây giờ look what happens. We also have some positive các điện tích that are going to be close to those negatives. It basically reduces the thế hiệu between the plates on this side here you got negatives that are really close to the positive. Vậy they have some hiệu điện thế between them. Vậy at the end the total hiệu điện thế is going to end up dropping because you end up canceling out some of these positive các điện tích on the plates with the negative các điện tích from the material that are really close to it. Được rồi. Vậy the net hiệu điện thế is always a hiệu điện thế drop when I have charged plates and I stick something between them.
