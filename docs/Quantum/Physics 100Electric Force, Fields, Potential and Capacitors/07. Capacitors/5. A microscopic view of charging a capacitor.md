### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy to understand this picture a little bit more let's again xem xét this simple circuit here where I have a battery of a certain hiệu điện thế. Again we're gonna have one point five Vôn here Được. And let's imagine Bây giờ. Vậy this is a positive and this is negative. Đúng. Vậy imagine you are an electron somewhere in this segment of wire anywhere it could be on the plate could be in the segment of wire. Đúng. What do you want to do if you're an electron if you're an electron over here. What you're going to do is you're going to want to go toward the positive plate. Đúng. If you're electrons electrons that was sitting on the plate. You want to go toward the positive plate and you have a conducting path to get there. Vậy all the kind of free electrons there kind of go over here. Vậy let's get rid of them. They're not going to be all the free electrons we're gonna get rid of a lot of them. Imagine you're an electron kind of on the other side. Được rồi if you're an electron over here what do you want to do. Well you want to get away from this negative side. Đúng. Vậy the electrons over here are going to want to go in this hướng. Electrons are really going to want to go kind of deposit themselves on the plate and electrons that were on this side. They want to go toward the positive plate. Vậy again if I had an electron that was originally Đúng there again it wants to leave and get off that mặt phẳng. Vậy at the end if I have negative các điện tích that have left this plate guess what happens at the end it's going to become positively charged because the electrons want to get attracted to this positive plate from the battery the positive side of the battery on the negative side again you're going to have all these excess electrons Bây giờ that are going to go on the plate. Vậy what chúng ta có is something like this. Bây giờ it doesn't continue forever. Đúng the reason that you have this motion of the điện tích is because you really had this battery that was kind of producing an điện trường inside the wire. But imagine Bây giờ chúng ta có kind of two things going on. Let's have a look at a segment of wire Đúng here. OK. chúng ta có the battery that produces an điện trường that goes up like this. Vậy this is either the battery and what else after you place or you've removed some negative điện tích from this plate. Guess what happens. Được rồi. It basically produces an opposite. Được rồi. E from the tụ điện and once these are balanced out again there's not going to be anything that's going to happen the net điện trường is going to be zero over here. Vậy this process is going to stop. It's basically going to stop once the hiệu điện thế across this tụ điện V is equal to one point five Vôn. In that case it's going to be equal to the hiệu điện thế of the battery. Được rồi. Vậy chúng ta có the hiệu điện thế of the battery is going to be equal to the hiệu điện thế across this tụ điện. OK. And that's when the process stops if you know the hiệu điện thế across the tụ điện then that's when we use our phương trình that the điện tích on the tụ điện is equal to the điện dung multiplied by the hiệu điện thế across the tụ điện. And again Bây giờ chúng ta có thể get our simple calculation which was three times 10 to the negative six cool ohms again going back. điều đó có nghĩa là that this plate here has positive three times 10 to the negative six columns. And this guy Đúng here has negative three times ten to the negative six columns. You always have a positive and a negative plate like this. And we use our basic tụ điện phương trình in order to find its value.
