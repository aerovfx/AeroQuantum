00:00.350 --> 00:00.600
All right.

00:00.600 --> 00:07.260
The last thing I want to say here about these capacitors here is concerning the potential energy stored

00:07.740 --> 00:09.210
in capacitors.

00:09.330 --> 00:12.840
Again to get charges on these plates it doesn't happen by itself.

00:12.840 --> 00:15.400
You need to plug in a battery.

00:15.540 --> 00:18.340
And it's the battery that does the work.

00:18.450 --> 00:18.810
OK.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.930
That's where the energy comes from.

00:20.940 --> 00:21.150
All right.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.330
It comes from the power supply.

00:23.340 --> 00:28.190
So let me just write this down so battery does work.

00:29.150 --> 00:35.940
And as a result of something doing work we store what kind of energy we would store electrical potential

00:35.940 --> 00:38.260
energy in this capacitor.

00:38.260 --> 00:39.840
So let me just right capacitor

00:42.130 --> 00:46.420
stores electrical potential energy

00:54.750 --> 00:55.110
all right.

00:55.230 --> 00:57.750
So that is a very very important concept.

00:58.050 --> 01:02.410
So the next thing we want to do is how do we calculate the electrical potential energy.

01:02.610 --> 01:09.360
Again first we're going to start with our famous capacitor equation the famous capacitor equation is

01:09.480 --> 01:17.520
simply that the charge is equal to the capacitance multiplied by the voltage between the plates.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.560
So again one plate has positive charge.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.360
The other plate has negative charge.

01:21.360 --> 01:23.670
There is a voltage between those plates.

01:23.670 --> 01:28.680
This is number one that's always true.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.250
So how much potential energy with there have.

01:31.470 --> 01:37.950
Would you have let me write down the first equation going gonna write this equation three different

01:37.950 --> 01:38.280
ways.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.870
There's three variables involved.

01:39.870 --> 01:44.430
There's the charge there is capacitance and there is voltage.

01:44.430 --> 01:47.720
The equation for potential energy involves two of those variables.

01:47.820 --> 01:54.330
One way of writing it is like this one half the charge multiplied by the voltage.

01:54.550 --> 02:00.390
If you remember the units here the units for charge are columns the units for voltage are joules per

02:00.390 --> 02:05.970
column if you multiply those things at the end of the day we're going to get a quantity here that is

02:05.970 --> 02:09.010
measured in Joules.

02:09.150 --> 02:13.090
So this is the first equation for energy.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.480
How can I.

02:14.550 --> 02:17.280
It's written in terms of the charge in the voltage.

02:17.280 --> 02:23.520
What if instead if I wanted to write this equation without the charge q in that equation what I could

02:23.520 --> 02:27.120
do is use equation 1 and eliminate the charge.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.450
So let me go ahead and do that.

02:29.890 --> 02:36.210
So instead of having the charged Q I'm going to replace Q by the capacitance multiplied by the voltage

02:36.210 --> 02:42.380
I could do that and I still have the voltage from the equation for potential energy.

02:42.480 --> 02:48.410
So at the end you could see that this one here reduces to one half CV squared.

02:48.750 --> 02:55.510
Same equation just different terms involved so somebody gives you the capacitance and you know the voltage

02:55.540 --> 02:57.750
automatically you could quickly calculate it.

02:57.820 --> 02:59.490
You don't have to go through the charge.

03:00.250 --> 03:03.380
So that's the second way of calculating the same quantity.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.270
The third way now which often comes up is sometimes

03:10.310 --> 03:13.630
you may just know the charge in the capacitance.

03:13.740 --> 03:18.950
Then usually you'd have to go through the voltage but again I can use my start with the first equation

03:18.950 --> 03:20.660
for potential energy.

03:20.930 --> 03:27.230
And let me eliminate voltage and I'm going to eliminate the voltage using equation 1.

03:27.410 --> 03:33.050
So again I'm going to have the charge q from the definition and instead of me writing voltage over here

03:33.050 --> 03:38.870
for that term I am going to write charge divided by the capacitance.

03:38.870 --> 03:47.880
So the third formula for calculating the exact same thing is Q squared divided by C Okay.

03:47.900 --> 03:56.330
So we really have three different equations to calculate the energy generated is one two and three they

03:56.330 --> 03:58.280
all mean the same thing.

03:58.580 --> 04:00.020
They're all the same.

04:00.020 --> 04:05.950
They will give you a number of joules if you're charges and cooldowns and your voltage is in volts.

04:06.080 --> 04:06.570
Okay.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.320
So that is really really important.
