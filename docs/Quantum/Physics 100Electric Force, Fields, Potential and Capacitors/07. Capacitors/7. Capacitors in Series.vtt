00:00.240 --> 00:04.350
So let's recap here what we just saw for capacitors and series.

00:04.410 --> 00:06.930
The first thing is our capacitor equation.

00:06.930 --> 00:13.200
It applies to each one of those capacitors which means you're going to write that that charge q one

00:13.590 --> 00:20.460
is equal to see one multiplied by the voltage across that one capacitor we call that V1.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.520
We go ahead and show what V1 looks like.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.030
The voltage across here.

00:24.090 --> 00:24.960
Right.

00:25.020 --> 00:27.280
And this is the voltage across this one.

00:27.550 --> 00:30.560
And this is the voltage across this one V3.

00:30.630 --> 00:38.800
So you're going to write this for each one of those capacitors right C2 V2 Q Three.

00:38.930 --> 00:39.430
Oy.

00:39.450 --> 00:40.260
Try that again.

00:40.260 --> 00:41.130
Come on.

00:41.130 --> 00:47.570
Q three equals to see three v three very important.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.710
Now what do we say about the charge.

00:49.770 --> 00:53.350
The charge is the same for all three capacitors.

00:53.370 --> 01:00.270
OK so that means each one of these has to be simply equal to Q some value.

01:00.390 --> 01:03.180
You have to have that the charge is the same.

01:03.180 --> 01:04.980
So again we have to have that.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.710
I mean make a bullet point here.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.240
Same charge on each

01:12.560 --> 01:13.250
capacitor

01:16.100 --> 01:20.410
again this applies only to capacitors in series with each other.

01:20.680 --> 01:25.910
And the other important equation that you need to solve any of these problems over here is that the

01:25.910 --> 01:36.620
voltage if I look at the voltage across each one if I is some those values v 1 plus v 2 plus v 3 again

01:36.710 --> 01:42.800
adding the voltages across it has to be the same as going across the other side has to be equal to the

01:42.800 --> 01:44.790
voltage across the battery.

01:44.900 --> 01:45.790
Super important.

01:46.730 --> 01:46.990
All right.

01:47.020 --> 01:52.580
So let me clean up the first equations I don't need a subscript for the charges because they're all

01:52.580 --> 02:01.180
the same and let me move this over and the other thing that you can do with these types of circuits

02:01.180 --> 02:04.860
right here you do one other thing.

02:05.370 --> 02:12.980
All right that's the charge relationship I can represent it using an effective an equivalent capacitance.

02:12.980 --> 02:16.280
All right I could simplify the circuit and write it like this.

02:16.280 --> 02:24.400
I have the same voltage V and I'm able to write it in terms of just one equivalent capacitance.

02:24.490 --> 02:31.490
It's not the same value as C one C two or C three but it's a combination of all three and this is what

02:31.490 --> 02:34.940
you call an equivalent capacitance.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.600
I'll show you a trick now for calculating the equivalent capacitance.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.290
It's very very straightforward.

02:41.360 --> 02:47.450
It's easier to calculate one divided by C equivalent and at the end what you have to do is take the

02:47.450 --> 02:48.860
reciprocal of that.

02:48.920 --> 02:49.970
All right.

02:50.210 --> 02:57.860
Because the one over the equivalent capacitance is one divided by C one plus one divided by C two plus

02:57.860 --> 02:59.640
one divided by C three.

02:59.720 --> 03:04.460
If you have more you just keep adding them like that one divided by okay.

03:04.470 --> 03:09.630
And after if I want to get the value for the equivalent capacitance you have to take the one divided

03:09.630 --> 03:13.320
by the number that you're going to get over here for example in this bracket.

03:13.410 --> 03:17.730
Can't forget that last step otherwise you get the wrong answer you don't have the right units.

03:17.840 --> 03:18.030
OK.

03:18.060 --> 03:24.990
So it's very easy to set up an equivalent circuit if you have capacitors in series with each other.

03:25.080 --> 03:31.230
Once you have this remember that the charge that you have on this equivalent capacitance is going to

03:31.230 --> 03:34.740
be the same charge Q that you had everywhere else.

03:35.100 --> 03:42.070
So you're still going to have plus q on this plate and negative Q on that plate so the way that the

03:42.070 --> 03:50.020
capacitor equation looks like for this simplified Circuit Assembly q equals to the equivalent capacitance

03:50.020 --> 03:52.540
multiplied by the voltage.

03:52.870 --> 03:57.650
Always the same equation that applies if you have a simple circuit like this.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.020
All right.

03:58.030 --> 04:02.640
So that is a recap of what's going on for capacitors in series.

04:02.650 --> 04:09.550
Same charge the sum of the voltages has to be equal to the voltage across all three which is the same

04:09.550 --> 04:12.210
voltage as the battery in this case.

04:12.460 --> 04:19.420
And you could simplify using an equivalent capacitance and the formula for the equivalent capacitance

04:19.420 --> 04:21.520
is the one provided here in purple.

04:21.520 --> 04:21.730
All right.
