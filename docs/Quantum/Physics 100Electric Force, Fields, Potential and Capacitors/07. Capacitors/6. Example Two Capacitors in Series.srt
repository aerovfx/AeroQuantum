WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:04.950
And now I want to look at what happens in circuits where there's more than one capacitor.

00:04.950 --> 00:12.510
So again we have our basic equation that q equals to the capacitance multiplied by the voltage and that's

00:12.510 --> 00:16.530
fine if there is only one capacitor one voltage.

00:16.530 --> 00:16.740
Right.

00:16.740 --> 00:20.700
We want to find the charge on it but what happens now if there's two and they're connected one after

00:20.700 --> 00:21.740
another.

00:22.050 --> 00:26.820
We say that when they're connected in this way as shown in the figure that they are in series with one

00:26.820 --> 00:27.750
another.

00:27.750 --> 00:28.000
OK.

00:28.020 --> 00:36.360
So we'd like to be able to answer how much charge is there on each capacitor and also what is the voltage

00:36.360 --> 00:37.770
between the plates.

00:37.770 --> 00:39.060
Is the voltage the same.

00:39.090 --> 00:39.360
OK.

00:39.380 --> 00:41.280
Again let's assume that they're different.

00:41.400 --> 00:45.900
They could be the same capacitance that'll be a limiting case but let's just assume that they're different.

00:45.900 --> 00:47.220
We'll give them some values.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.390
Let's give a battery a voltage and let's do the calculation.

00:52.380 --> 00:58.050
Ideally what we want to be able to do is simplify complicated circuits that have more than one capacitor

00:58.380 --> 01:00.580
into something that's simpler.

01:00.580 --> 01:07.110
So I'm also going to show you how you can write this circuit here how you can represent it using a one

01:07.110 --> 01:14.760
battery the same battery that's connected up here and instead of having two what we can do is just represent

01:14.760 --> 01:18.740
this more complicated circuit by a simplified circuit.

01:18.980 --> 01:26.130
And what I'm doing here is I'm going to produce an equivalent capacitance that is going to be equivalent

01:26.130 --> 01:28.310
to both values like this.

01:28.320 --> 01:36.090
So the value over here is not C1 or C2 but it's going to be some equivalent value of both combinations.

01:36.090 --> 01:40.860
So let me show you how to do that and how to solve this problem once we have the problem boiled down

01:40.860 --> 01:42.660
to a simple circuit like this.

01:42.660 --> 01:45.630
Applying my capacitor equation is super easy right.

01:45.690 --> 01:51.250
Says that the charge is equal to C equivalent multiplied by the voltage.

01:51.420 --> 01:55.410
All right so let's go ahead set up the problem and let's see what's going on.

01:55.410 --> 01:55.620
All right.

01:55.650 --> 01:59.040
So here's the simple circuit I have a two capacitors.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.800
These are the values I'm going to take.

02:00.800 --> 02:06.900
C One is 10 micro Feride and C two is 40 micro Feride and the voltage is 10.

02:06.910 --> 02:11.590
Again this is an example of capacitors in series.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.580
So we have two questions What's the voltage across each plate.

02:14.610 --> 02:21.900
So if I was going to kind of measure the voltage here across the first one this would be v 1 and if

02:21.900 --> 02:28.260
I measure the voltage across the second one just do it a different color this here would be the voltage

02:28.260 --> 02:30.180
V to.

02:30.630 --> 02:35.760
If I measure the voltage across the battery I would get 10 volts I'm going to label these points over

02:35.760 --> 02:45.540
here so let's call this point a maybe point B C and D.

02:45.920 --> 02:52.120
OK so the voltage v 1 may just write this down v 1 is really the difference between A and B.

02:52.130 --> 03:00.360
So it's kind of V A mine is VB the voltage across the second capacitor is really V C minus V.

03:00.370 --> 03:01.180
D.

03:01.590 --> 03:02.680
OK.

03:02.930 --> 03:05.180
What else can we say.

03:05.240 --> 03:07.670
Again this is just a wire a wires a piece of metal.

03:07.670 --> 03:13.970
So actually we could say to the voltage across A B and C has to be the same right VB must be equal to

03:13.970 --> 03:14.550
V see.

03:14.600 --> 03:17.450
This is a wire it's an equity potential

03:20.820 --> 03:22.740
same potential the wires.

03:22.740 --> 03:28.890
So that means that whatever voltage I have at this positive terminal the battery has to be the same

03:28.890 --> 03:30.300
voltage everywhere here.

03:30.300 --> 03:36.510
So this is also positive whatever voltage I have at this negative has to be the same voltage everywhere

03:36.510 --> 03:40.800
here because it's a piece of metal so it's that plate is negative.

03:40.800 --> 03:45.810
Again if you imagine you're an electron anywhere here what you want to do when you see a positive terminal

03:46.140 --> 03:50.910
the electrons want to go this way so that's going to leave this positive again.

03:50.910 --> 03:56.220
Now imagine if this now becomes positive what is that going to do to any of the charges in the middle

03:56.220 --> 03:57.630
section over there.

03:57.750 --> 04:03.540
It's going to attract all the negative charges and it's gonna be the same amount of charge.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.040
Now where are those charges come from.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.880
They came from the other plate.

04:06.930 --> 04:09.300
So again all the electrons left.

04:09.300 --> 04:14.640
So this one's positive and again this side is going to be negative because it's the electrons are getting

04:14.640 --> 04:18.240
repelled by this negative side of the battery all right.

04:18.240 --> 04:24.360
So what we have here actually which is really really important which is a property for capacitors and

04:24.360 --> 04:30.660
series only write it down it's really only four series for series we have to have that the charge on

04:30.660 --> 04:37.830
capacitor Q One has to be equal to the charge on capacitor Q2 what we're gonna do here is really at

04:37.830 --> 04:43.240
the end we're just gonna call this just give it one number since through the same just call it Q All

04:43.270 --> 04:51.340
right so let's write down our expression than we have q 1 the charge on the first capacitor is the capacitance

04:51.540 --> 04:58.180
C1 multiplied by the voltage V1 that's an equation what else we're gonna have.

04:58.200 --> 05:06.610
Q Two is equal to C to multiply by v 2 We're just applying our capacitor equation here for each capacitor

05:06.970 --> 05:12.970
that I could do this is kind of true for any capacitor but now there's this simplification because these

05:12.970 --> 05:19.330
charges are all the same so actually we could just get rid of that and again that is only four series

05:19.330 --> 05:23.990
that I'm able to do this all right what else can we do.

05:24.060 --> 05:29.550
So we really have a couple unknowns over here all we know right now is the capacitance we don't know

05:29.550 --> 05:36.150
the charge q we just know it's the same but we don't know the voltage across each one but there is something

05:36.150 --> 05:42.570
that we do know we knew do know the voltage across this battery which means that actually the voltage

05:42.570 --> 05:48.510
across the battery has to be the voltage across this one plus the voltage across that one because if

05:48.510 --> 05:53.760
I'm over here and I want to go right across to the other side or I can either go through the battery

05:54.360 --> 05:56.940
so I'd have a voltage difference of 10 volts.

05:56.940 --> 06:00.620
In this case or I could go across both capacitors.

06:00.870 --> 06:04.760
So actually you should be able to write this expression also so this is another equation.

06:04.770 --> 06:08.940
This is v 1 plus the voltage across the v 2.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.850
This here has to be equal to the voltage of the battery.

06:11.850 --> 06:12.630
Let me just call it.

06:13.060 --> 06:16.230
Let's just keep it as V that's fine.

06:16.290 --> 06:16.460
All right.

06:16.470 --> 06:19.590
So this is really the second equation.

06:19.770 --> 06:25.740
So again we want to go back and what is the voltage across each capacitor again this is equation 2.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.680
And these ones here are kind of equation 1.

06:29.940 --> 06:33.590
All right so we have to combine both of these in order to get to a final expression.

06:34.620 --> 06:39.960
So the way I'm gonna do that here is I'm going to eliminate V1 and V2 here and just have the charge.

06:40.800 --> 06:50.520
So how would you get rid of V1 V1 you can write it as Q divided by C 1 and that's using this top equation

06:51.180 --> 06:58.600
plus q divided by C 2 and that there has to be equal to V all right.

06:58.600 --> 07:05.410
Now you can see we only have one unknown in this equation right here so I could factor out the Q we

07:05.430 --> 07:07.860
do that it's going to look something like this.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.510
Let's give myself a bit of space here.

07:09.510 --> 07:17.070
I factor out the Q I'll open up kind of a big bracket and here I have one over C one plus one over C2

07:18.640 --> 07:22.670
and this here equals to V the voltage across the battery.

07:22.720 --> 07:27.300
All right the last thing all you have to do now is simply bring this curly bracket term on the other

07:27.300 --> 07:27.820
side.

07:28.360 --> 07:34.140
OK so the final expression that you get is that the charge q is equal to some number that looks like

07:34.140 --> 07:39.640
this one over see one plus one over C2.

07:40.410 --> 07:45.840
And this is to the negative one because I have to bring it to the denominator and multiplied by the

07:45.840 --> 07:48.000
voltage.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.690
You see this form of the equation here.

07:50.790 --> 07:58.320
It looks very very similar to this one that the charged Q is proportional to the voltage across the

07:58.320 --> 08:06.140
capacitor except the value over here this guy here is more complicated the more complicated because

08:06.140 --> 08:08.660
there is more than one.

08:09.340 --> 08:17.150
So actually it turns out that you're able to rewrite this circuit here and express it as a simple equivalence

08:17.150 --> 08:23.220
circuit and the equivalent circuit looks like this it's still the same battery again.

08:23.390 --> 08:26.090
And now we're going to have an equivalent capacitor

08:28.740 --> 08:33.540
in the equivalent capacitance is represented by this Terminator over here.

08:33.540 --> 08:42.150
So C equivalent is actually if there's two of them it's one over C one plus one over C two to the negative

08:42.150 --> 08:43.100
one.

08:43.680 --> 08:49.680
That is the equivalent capacitance and you see if I do that now I can rewrite the equation here as the

08:49.680 --> 08:56.640
charged q equals to my equivalent capacitance multiplied by the voltage V

08:59.380 --> 09:02.470
so if I have two capacitors in series with each other.

09:02.470 --> 09:08.420
This is what the equation looks like all right we should be able to calculate all our values.

09:08.430 --> 09:10.340
Now let's go ahead and do that.

09:10.430 --> 09:15.820
So again I'm just going to make myself a little bit of space over here and let's go ahead and do that

09:16.070 --> 09:22.940
so we can calculate what this equivalent capacitance is and then all I have to do is multiply that by

09:22.940 --> 09:27.100
the voltage in order to get the charge Q Okay.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.220
So let's do that over here so the charge q

09:33.700 --> 09:34.890
is going to be equal.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.140
I'll.

09:35.160 --> 09:39.660
What is my equivalent capacitance that down over here.

09:39.670 --> 09:43.200
So this is going to be one over 10 micro Farad.

09:43.370 --> 09:48.320
I'll just keep it in micro Feride plus one over 40 micro Feride.

09:48.490 --> 09:51.430
Again you could put the ten to the negative six terms if you want.

09:51.430 --> 09:55.690
At the end it's just going to give me a value of micro fare.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.330
And OK.

09:57.340 --> 10:03.190
So how would you calculate this you have to put this on a common denominator this would be for over

10:03.190 --> 10:04.300
40.

10:04.600 --> 10:13.180
So at the end this term here would be five over 40 and so see equivalent at the end should be.

10:13.180 --> 10:18.720
And I have to take the reciprocal of that should give me eight micro Farid.

10:19.400 --> 10:27.680
So what you end up getting here is eight micro Feride eight times 10 to the negative six and multiplied

10:27.680 --> 10:37.180
by the voltage multiplied by 10 so this simply becomes becomes 80 micro Coolum is the charge on each

10:37.180 --> 10:37.600
plate

10:41.030 --> 10:42.360
it's pretty straightforward.

10:42.360 --> 10:48.720
So I mean is a charge on each one of these plates is 80 microcosms positive 80 on the first plate negative

10:48.750 --> 10:55.770
80 on the second positive 80 over here negative Haiti micro cool homes on the last one.

10:55.770 --> 10:55.980
All right.

10:55.980 --> 11:02.960
How do you calculate the voltage now between each plate or their voltage across each plate I should

11:02.960 --> 11:04.100
say.

11:04.400 --> 11:10.460
Again all we have to do now is go back and examine both of those because we know the charge now on each

11:10.460 --> 11:11.720
plate.

11:11.750 --> 11:17.920
So really all we're doing now is just using our capacitor equation for each one individually.

11:17.960 --> 11:21.340
Let me do that at the top.

11:21.610 --> 11:22.610
This over a little bit.

11:24.340 --> 11:24.650
OK.

11:24.680 --> 11:34.090
So let's use the first equation define what is the voltage V1 V1 is equal to the charge q divided by

11:34.180 --> 11:37.970
C1 it's 80 micro columns

11:43.160 --> 11:55.270
80 times 10 to the negative 6 and divided by 10 times ten to the negative six gives me eight volts.

11:55.920 --> 12:03.210
So V1 over here should be equal to eight volts the voltage across the second one again I know that I

12:03.210 --> 12:09.600
have to have ten across here and if I've already gone down two volts when I cross over here it means

12:09.600 --> 12:12.300
there's only two volts left over here.

12:12.660 --> 12:19.130
This guy here better be equal to two volts you see that from equation to right.

12:19.150 --> 12:21.480
If this is eight and this is ten.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.850
This here has to be two volts.

12:23.950 --> 12:25.650
Well we could also use the equation right.

12:25.690 --> 12:33.190
The second equation right here if we apply it to that capacitor is v 2 equals the charge across the

12:33.190 --> 12:37.590
plate and the charge on the plates divided by the capacitance okay.

12:37.590 --> 12:48.850
Here we have 80 micro Feride micro cool on having trouble today and the capacitance C2 was 40 micro

12:48.850 --> 12:56.370
Feride at the end you could see this gives me 2 volts if I use this equation or if I use equation 2

12:56.370 --> 12:58.990
Over here I'm also gonna get two volts.

12:58.990 --> 13:02.490
OK so a couple of important things.

13:02.510 --> 13:08.030
Let's look at the equivalent capacitance if I have more than two let's get a general expression.

13:08.520 --> 13:08.830
Okay.

13:08.850 --> 13:15.510
And just highlight again the key things to capacitors in series.

13:15.510 --> 13:24.960
Notice that we get a bigger voltage drop across the one with the smallest capacitance you get the smaller

13:24.960 --> 13:29.010
voltage drop across the object with the largest capacitance.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.390
Okay so let's highlight some of those properties for capacitors in series.
