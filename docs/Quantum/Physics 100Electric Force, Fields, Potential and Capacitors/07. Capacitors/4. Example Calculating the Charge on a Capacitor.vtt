00:00.090 --> 00:00.260
All right.

00:00.270 --> 00:01.560
Let's do an example.

00:01.570 --> 00:05.190
OK first of all you don't want to be drawing something like this all the time especially when we're

00:05.190 --> 00:06.930
gonna be dealing with circuits.

00:06.990 --> 00:12.430
So whenever you're dealing with circuits the symbol for capacitors.

00:12.490 --> 00:12.730
OK

00:16.840 --> 00:17.900
they're represented like this.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.090
So here's a wire.

00:19.310 --> 00:23.450
And again you actually do make parallel plates you just make them smaller and then you continue with

00:23.450 --> 00:24.450
your wire.

00:24.480 --> 00:24.680
All right.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.490
And then you would call this the capacitance.

00:28.590 --> 00:36.870
Imagine you have a power supply or a battery a battery has a symbol again some wires and usually there

00:36.870 --> 00:40.090
is a long line and a short line.

00:40.250 --> 00:45.580
And typically what you say is there is a voltage between both of those positive and negative.

00:45.590 --> 00:50.270
The positive is usually the longer line the negative is the shortest one and usually you say there is

00:50.270 --> 00:52.790
a voltage between those plates.

00:52.820 --> 00:57.310
For example if we use just the standard battery it's one point five volts.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.450
That's the voltage between the plates.

00:59.450 --> 01:01.690
And again they really mean a delta V.

01:01.700 --> 01:03.930
But sometimes they just leave out the Delta.

01:04.550 --> 01:06.650
It's the difference of voltage between both of those.

01:06.650 --> 01:10.400
So we can draw a simple circuit with one capacitor.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.690
Let's go ahead and do that.

01:11.720 --> 01:16.550
Here's some wire and here I'm going to draw one value of a capacitor.

01:16.550 --> 01:19.850
Here's a simple circuit with a capacitor.

01:19.850 --> 01:25.950
So again we're going to take these equal to one point five volts from my battery and we're going to

01:26.090 --> 01:35.870
assume that this capacitor here as a value equal to let's say to micro Feride again sometimes they leave

01:35.870 --> 01:37.550
out the A it's just micro f.

01:37.790 --> 01:38.050
OK.

01:38.750 --> 01:42.200
So the question is how much charge would there be on the plates.

01:42.230 --> 01:46.520
If I connect this capacitor to this battery OK.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.800
And again the amount of charge you just go back to my equation over here the charge is simply the capacitance

01:52.220 --> 01:55.220
multiplied by the voltage in the voltage that you're going to get.

01:55.220 --> 01:59.110
Again this is a wire a wire is an equity potential right.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.500
It's a conductor.

02:00.500 --> 02:04.180
So that means that this plate here is at plus in this place.

02:04.220 --> 02:07.400
This other plate is at negative right.

02:07.410 --> 02:12.710
So if I would kind of do like this and the voltage between those plates would be equal to the voltage

02:12.710 --> 02:19.910
across the battery whatever voltage I have here is going to be the same voltage everywhere here because

02:19.910 --> 02:21.820
this is a wire connected to a plate.

02:21.830 --> 02:23.920
So it has to be the same.

02:23.960 --> 02:24.200
All right.

02:24.260 --> 02:29.510
So if I wanted to calculate how much charge we have again you take the value of the capacitance it's

02:29.510 --> 02:37.190
two times 10 to the negative six and multiplied by the voltage the voltage in this case is one point

02:37.190 --> 02:38.440
five.

02:39.080 --> 02:44.750
So we multiply two and one point five you're gonna get three times ten to the negative six.

02:44.930 --> 02:45.890
And that's the charge.

02:45.890 --> 02:48.760
So this bill would be measured in columns.

02:49.180 --> 02:49.430
Okay.

02:49.460 --> 02:55.610
So again if you would zoom in that means one plate would be have plus three micro columns the other

02:55.610 --> 02:59.120
plate would have negative three micro columns.

02:59.330 --> 03:05.990
But this is kind of a quick little example on how to deal with calculating the charge on capacitors.
