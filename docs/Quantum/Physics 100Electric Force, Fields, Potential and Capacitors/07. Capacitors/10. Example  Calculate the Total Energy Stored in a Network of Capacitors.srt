00:00.410 --> 00:05.070
In this example here I have a network of three different capacitors.

00:05.070 --> 00:11.410
And my goal is to calculate what is the total energy stored in all of the capacitors.

00:11.410 --> 00:11.630
Okay.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.570
Again it's connected to a 9 volt battery.

00:14.670 --> 00:21.270
So what I would do for this problem right here is I would probably want to simplify this and if I can

00:21.270 --> 00:30.300
somehow simplify this and replace it with one effective circuit with a 9 volt battery let's kind of

00:30.300 --> 00:31.830
redraw it here.

00:32.310 --> 00:39.030
If I can represent this complicated circuit with one capacitor except it's going to be one equivalent

00:39.030 --> 00:43.160
capacitor which I'll have to use my rules in order to apply.

00:43.170 --> 00:43.400
All right.

00:43.410 --> 00:50.220
So I'd still have the same battery and over here this is going to be some equivalent capacitance of

00:50.220 --> 00:51.870
this entire network.

00:52.050 --> 00:57.750
And then this would be very easy to calculate how much energy is stored if I have this as the electrical

00:57.750 --> 01:05.160
energy again if I know the capacitance it would just be one half CV squared.

01:05.160 --> 01:13.170
And this here would be the equivalent capacitance in V would be 9 volts between the plates over there.

01:13.170 --> 01:13.410
All right.

01:13.410 --> 01:16.320
So let's see how we can simplify this network.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.340
So I'm gonna do it in two stages.

01:18.360 --> 01:23.340
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to simplify everything here in this dashed orange line

01:24.770 --> 01:34.220
here what we have are two capacitors in parallel so if it's in parallel you remember the rule for the

01:34.220 --> 01:35.420
equivalent capacitance.

01:35.420 --> 01:39.260
So again it's only representing simplifying both of those.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.750
The rule if they're in parallel.

01:40.740 --> 01:44.630
Call the C equivalent one is going to be equal to.

01:44.660 --> 01:46.310
You simply have to add them up right.

01:46.310 --> 01:50.030
C one plus C two that is the rule if they're in parallel.

01:50.030 --> 01:53.640
So in this case it's straightforward it's simply ten plus 40.

01:53.690 --> 02:01.370
Again everything here is in microfiber Ed so I would get 50 micro fare add for the equivalent capacitance

02:01.370 --> 02:02.960
of this.

02:02.960 --> 02:10.770
So now what I have is I have a simplified circuit in which I have a capacitor like this and an equivalent

02:10.770 --> 02:16.300
capacitor which I just calculated so I've simplified that considerably.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.320
This one here is 50 micro Farad.

02:19.860 --> 02:22.250
And the first one I haven't touched that one yet.

02:22.290 --> 02:24.270
This one is still 20 micro fare.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.860
It's still the same one is over here.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.990
So now how would I simplify both of those.

02:30.030 --> 02:32.070
Again this is really the last step right.

02:32.090 --> 02:37.320
I want this circuit to represent it by this guy right here.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.830
So how do I calculate the equivalent capacitance in this case.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.080
This is the final value.

02:42.090 --> 02:47.600
Again I'm going to use the rule because these are in series with each other.

02:47.700 --> 02:54.480
So if I want to calculate the capacitance of two capacitance in series what I have to do is use the

02:54.480 --> 03:02.690
other equation to one divided by the equivalent capacitance is one divided by twenty plus one divided

03:02.690 --> 03:03.890
by 50.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.380
Again everything here is in micro Feride.

03:07.720 --> 03:07.960
All right.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.680
To evaluate this what I'm going to do is just maybe put it on a common denominator.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.840
A hundred is a common denominator.

03:14.840 --> 03:21.460
So what I would do would be this would be five over one hundred plus two over one hundred.

03:21.530 --> 03:21.750
All right.

03:21.770 --> 03:25.250
So at the end this gives me seven over one hundred.

03:25.610 --> 03:32.540
But again I remember I have to flip the fractions so see equivalent is 100 divided by seven.

03:32.600 --> 03:38.300
You put that in the calculator you should get something that is roughly 14 micro Feride.

03:38.690 --> 03:38.900
All right.

03:38.930 --> 03:42.320
So that is the equivalent capacitance right here.

03:42.320 --> 03:42.800
So that's it.

03:42.800 --> 03:43.720
Now I know everything.

03:43.730 --> 03:51.060
If I want to find the total energy one half the equivalent capacitance is 14.

03:51.350 --> 03:55.930
And now I want to get a number in jewels so I will evaluate what the micro is.

03:56.210 --> 03:59.540
And then the voltage in this case it's connected to a nine volt battery.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.260
And I have to square that value.

04:02.260 --> 04:04.190
All right again you put that in the calculator.

04:04.190 --> 04:05.460
Let me go ahead and do that one.

04:05.480 --> 04:14.730
A nine squared is eighty one in times while 14 e to the negative six and then multiplied by one half

04:14.740 --> 04:18.280
I'm kind of doing it backwards here I get five point six seven

04:22.370 --> 04:26.870
multiplied by ten to the negative four and that there is measured in Joules.

04:26.870 --> 04:30.500
Here is the total energy.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.300
And again it's electrical energy

04:36.820 --> 04:39.340
stored in all of these three capacitors.

04:39.430 --> 04:44.320
This is how much energy had to be supplied by this battery in order to charge these capacitors.
