00:00.120 --> 00:00.320
All right.

00:00.330 --> 00:04.530
So to understand this picture a little bit more let's again consider this simple circuit here where

00:04.530 --> 00:07.360
I have a battery of a certain voltage.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.080
Again we're gonna have one point five volts here okay.

00:11.190 --> 00:13.140
And let's imagine now.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.810
So this is a positive and this is negative.

00:15.810 --> 00:16.210
Right.

00:16.590 --> 00:23.250
So imagine you are an electron somewhere in this segment of wire anywhere it could be on the plate could

00:23.250 --> 00:24.820
be in the segment of wire.

00:24.820 --> 00:25.220
Right.

00:25.260 --> 00:29.140
What do you want to do if you're an electron if you're an electron over here.

00:29.220 --> 00:33.780
What you're going to do is you're going to want to go toward the positive plate.

00:33.940 --> 00:34.720
Right.

00:34.750 --> 00:37.100
If you're electrons electrons that was sitting on the plate.

00:37.110 --> 00:42.510
You want to go toward the positive plate and you have a conducting path to get there.

00:42.540 --> 00:47.220
So all the kind of free electrons there kind of go over here.

00:47.220 --> 00:48.410
So let's get rid of them.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.960
They're not going to be all the free electrons we're gonna get rid of a lot of them.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.830
Imagine you're an electron kind of on the other side.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.820
All right if you're an electron over here what do you want to do.

01:00.830 --> 01:03.280
Well you want to get away from this negative side.

01:03.410 --> 01:03.650
Right.

01:03.650 --> 01:07.310
So the electrons over here are going to want to go in this direction.

01:07.640 --> 01:12.860
Electrons are really going to want to go kind of deposit themselves on the plate and electrons that

01:12.860 --> 01:13.850
were on this side.

01:13.910 --> 01:17.450
They want to go toward the positive plate.

01:17.450 --> 01:21.980
So again if I had an electron that was originally right there again it wants to leave and get off that

01:21.980 --> 01:22.400
plane.

01:22.940 --> 01:28.730
So at the end if I have negative charges that have left this plate guess what happens at the end it's

01:28.730 --> 01:35.570
going to become positively charged because the electrons want to get attracted to this positive plate

01:35.870 --> 01:41.720
from the battery the positive side of the battery on the negative side again you're going to have all

01:41.720 --> 01:46.850
these excess electrons now that are going to go on the plate.

01:46.850 --> 01:50.440
So what we have is something like this.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.350
Now it doesn't continue forever.

01:52.360 --> 02:00.260
Right the reason that you have this motion of the charge is because you really had this battery that

02:00.260 --> 02:04.410
was kind of producing an electric field inside the wire.

02:04.550 --> 02:08.180
But imagine now we have kind of two things going on.

02:08.180 --> 02:11.770
Let's have a look at a segment of wire right here.

02:11.930 --> 02:12.930
OK.

02:13.010 --> 02:16.760
We have the battery that produces an electric field that goes up like this.

02:16.760 --> 02:24.250
So this is either the battery and what else after you place or you've removed some negative charge from

02:24.250 --> 02:25.110
this plate.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.890
Guess what happens.

02:26.890 --> 02:27.120
All right.

02:27.120 --> 02:30.530
It basically produces an opposite.

02:30.540 --> 02:31.150
All right.

02:31.180 --> 02:38.740
E from the capacitor and once these are balanced out again there's not going to be anything that's going

02:38.740 --> 02:43.480
to happen the net electric field is going to be zero over here.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.890
So this process is going to stop.

02:46.210 --> 02:54.250
It's basically going to stop once the voltage across this capacitor V is equal to one point five volts.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.890
In that case it's going to be equal to the voltage of the battery.

02:57.910 --> 02:58.120
All right.

02:58.120 --> 03:05.790
So we have the voltage of the battery is going to be equal to the voltage across this capacitor.

03:05.790 --> 03:06.280
OK.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.800
And that's when the process stops if you know the voltage across the capacitor then that's when we use

03:11.800 --> 03:18.070
our equation that the charge on the capacitor is equal to the capacitance multiplied by the voltage

03:18.070 --> 03:21.600
across the capacitor.

03:22.150 --> 03:29.680
And again now we can get our simple calculation which was three times 10 to the negative six cool ohms

03:31.030 --> 03:31.900
again going back.

03:31.900 --> 03:37.410
That means that this plate here has positive three times 10 to the negative six columns.

03:37.420 --> 03:43.710
And this guy right here has negative three times ten to the negative six columns.

03:43.810 --> 03:47.220
You always have a positive and a negative plate like this.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.070
And we use our basic capacitor equation in order to find its value.
