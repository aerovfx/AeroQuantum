00:00.180 --> 00:04.270
All right I've got two really important setups here for you to understand.

00:04.460 --> 00:09.630
And if you can really grasp this video here in the different concepts then you've understood kind of

00:09.630 --> 00:15.670
the physics behind inserting capacitors inside parallel plates.

00:15.780 --> 00:16.050
OK.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.900
So Case Number One is I have two parallel plates and it's connected to a battery.

00:21.900 --> 00:26.670
I'm going to get a voltage between those plates POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHARGE.

00:26.670 --> 00:29.900
Same thing for the beginning of Case number two.

00:29.910 --> 00:35.190
Now for case number one over here what I'm going to do is I'm first going to disconnect the battery.

00:35.190 --> 00:43.670
Step 1 after their battery is disconnected I am going to insert a dielectric BETWEEN THE PLATES AND

00:43.670 --> 00:49.220
THEN I want us to look at what happens to these various quantities what happens to the capacitance.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.420
What happens to the charge.

00:51.530 --> 00:58.100
What happens to the voltage between the plates the electric field and the potential energy stored in

00:58.100 --> 01:00.200
this capacitor.

01:00.200 --> 01:00.400
All right.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.640
For case number two is going to be a little bit different so you charge up the plates.

01:04.640 --> 01:11.920
And now I'm going to keep the battery connected and while it's connected I'm going to insert a dielectric.

01:12.110 --> 01:18.320
Again let's look through all of these five different variables and see what happens to each one.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.970
Again the dielectric that I'm inserting here is going to be characterized with a little bit too wide.

01:25.010 --> 01:30.100
It's going to be characterized with a dielectric constant K which is bigger than one.

01:30.290 --> 01:30.680
OK.

01:31.430 --> 01:37.670
So let's see what happens to all these five variables for these two different ways of inserting a dielectric

01:37.670 --> 01:39.920
inside a capacitor.

01:39.980 --> 01:43.470
Let's look at Case Number One first just right.

01:43.470 --> 01:44.870
Number one here.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.970
So what happens to the capacitance.

01:47.300 --> 01:54.260
So imagine here we have a capacitance which is equal to c 0 for the first one.

01:54.260 --> 01:56.060
So what happened to the capacitance.

01:56.060 --> 02:02.120
Well the new capacitance would be equal to whatever the dielectric constant is.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.590
So it would be k multiplied by c 0.

02:04.590 --> 02:07.260
So it would increase by a factor of K.

02:07.800 --> 02:08.190
OK.

02:08.220 --> 02:14.560
So this guy he would go up and let me just write it by K by a factor of k.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.630
All right what happens to the charge on the plates.

02:17.700 --> 02:22.570
Again I've disconnected the battery and before that I had a certain amount of charge on the plates.

02:22.590 --> 02:24.800
So what happens now.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.020
A insert a dielectric do I change.

02:27.020 --> 02:33.600
Dutch charge on the plates while the charge is stuck and this here is an insulating material.

02:33.690 --> 02:36.620
So there is really nowhere for the charge to go.

02:36.660 --> 02:39.930
So really the charge has to remain the same.

02:39.930 --> 02:40.180
OK.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.700
You have no choice but the capacitance always increases.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.600
Remember we said that.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.250
So what about the voltage.

02:47.250 --> 02:50.510
Well now what I suggest you do is you go back to our equations.

02:50.520 --> 02:54.650
We had an equation for relating charged a voltage right.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.800
It looked like this.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.410
That was our famous capacitor equation except now what do we have.

03:01.530 --> 03:06.700
We have that the dielectric constant is equal to C subscript k.

03:06.990 --> 03:13.320
So think about rewriting this in terms of the voltage it's the charge divided by the capacitance.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.710
So what do we have now for case number one.

03:16.810 --> 03:21.760
We have that the charge stayed the same but the capacitance went up.

03:21.820 --> 03:26.360
So if I divide by a bigger number guess what's going to happen to the voltage.

03:26.560 --> 03:32.140
The voltage here is going to go down by a factor of k.

03:32.510 --> 03:38.990
Now if we think about our relationship now between voltage and electric field that's the next equation.

03:38.990 --> 03:44.810
The electric field was defined again just the magnitude as the change of voltage divided by the change

03:44.810 --> 03:49.320
in distance and what just happened I haven't changed the distance right.

03:49.490 --> 03:54.590
The distance between the plates is going to be the same but my overall voltage went down.

03:54.710 --> 03:55.420
So guess what.

03:55.430 --> 04:03.340
The electric field has to go down by K and the last one again I would suggest using one of our equations

04:03.340 --> 04:04.880
for potential energy.

04:04.990 --> 04:11.730
One equation was Q V What did we just say we said the charge stayed the same because it had nowhere

04:11.730 --> 04:16.120
to go and the voltage went down by a factor of k.

04:16.140 --> 04:22.490
So what happens to the potential energy the potential energy must also go down by a factor of K.

04:23.510 --> 04:32.910
OK so make sure we understand this first step by inserting a dielectric inside parallel plates.

04:33.770 --> 04:34.090
OK.

04:34.110 --> 04:40.470
So what happens in case number two again you keep the battery connected and then you insert the dielectric

04:40.470 --> 04:41.410
inside.

04:41.430 --> 04:42.860
So here is case number two.

04:42.960 --> 04:47.550
The first thing is the capacitance while capacitance always goes up.

04:47.550 --> 04:49.870
It doesn't matter when you put it in.

04:49.920 --> 04:58.770
So if this is a no K the dielectric constant the new capacitance is going to be a k times the original

04:58.770 --> 05:02.130
one when there was airfields on both of these cases.

05:02.280 --> 05:06.740
It's going to go up by a factor of k all right.

05:06.750 --> 05:11.050
What else happens over here what about the charge in the voltage.

05:11.160 --> 05:18.640
Again it's connected to a battery and if the battery voltage is v guess what the voltage here has the

05:18.650 --> 05:22.430
stay the same the voltage V

05:25.590 --> 05:30.060
again it must remain the same because it's connected to a battery with the voltage V.

05:30.570 --> 05:35.160
So that's kind of the difference over here between this case in that case.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.840
So again let me go to the center line here.

05:36.850 --> 05:43.650
Let's just write same All right what about the charge.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.000
Again think about our equation now.

05:46.210 --> 05:52.400
We have that the charge is the capacitance multiplied by the voltage.

05:52.540 --> 06:01.090
So if voltage stays the same and the capacitance goes up well what happens to the charge the charge

06:01.090 --> 06:04.630
has to also increase by a factor of K

06:08.300 --> 06:10.900
so kind of different over here.

06:11.020 --> 06:16.510
Again you're gonna have more charge because you have a bigger capacitance capacitance is the ability

06:16.510 --> 06:18.250
of an object a whole charge.

06:18.370 --> 06:25.670
If that goes up and I have a power supply that could keep doing work it's going to keep increasing it.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.310
All right what about the electric field.

06:28.570 --> 06:28.810
All right.

06:28.810 --> 06:31.880
So the electric field you've got to think about it here for a minute.

06:31.960 --> 06:37.990
Our electric field again if I go back to my equation describing the magnitude the voltage divided by

06:37.990 --> 06:44.170
the distance again I mean just read it as V divided by the distance between the plates.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.370
What happens to the voltage we just said the voltage stays the same.

06:48.370 --> 06:52.820
I haven't changed the distance between the plates so I guess what's going to happen right here.

06:52.820 --> 06:55.910
Same.

06:56.060 --> 06:56.360
All right.

06:56.360 --> 07:03.560
And the last one is the electrical potential energy again use one of my equations I'll use this one.

07:04.070 --> 07:07.330
We said that the charge goes up by a factor of k.

07:07.340 --> 07:08.690
This guy goes up.

07:08.690 --> 07:11.400
This guy here stays the same.

07:11.540 --> 07:18.080
So what's going to happen to the potential energy potential energy in this case here has to go up by

07:18.080 --> 07:21.090
a factor of K okay.

07:21.160 --> 07:26.200
So we have different scenarios depending on when you insert that dielectric inside.
