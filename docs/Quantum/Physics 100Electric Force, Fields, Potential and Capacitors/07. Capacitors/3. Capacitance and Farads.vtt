00:00.210 --> 00:00.420
All right.

00:00.420 --> 00:02.010
So this what we have right.

00:02.010 --> 00:03.720
Parallel plates.

00:04.020 --> 00:09.220
Plus cue negative cue we have a voltage V and this was the equation we got.

00:09.510 --> 00:15.840
Now remember charge on the plates is Q charge on one plate.

00:15.840 --> 00:21.500
Right on one plate we have opposite charge on the other plate.

00:21.510 --> 00:24.370
This here was measured in cool homes.

00:24.510 --> 00:26.260
What else V.

00:26.310 --> 00:34.890
This is voltage between the plates although you just write it as just one variable it's really delta

00:34.890 --> 00:35.270
v

00:39.060 --> 00:43.450
guy and this is what we call the capacitance

00:47.430 --> 00:50.930
the capacitance is really the constant of proportionality.

00:50.970 --> 00:55.990
It's a constant of proportionality.

01:01.730 --> 01:02.220
Okay.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.200
Between the charge and the voltage between the plates.

01:06.200 --> 01:10.520
So V is measured in volts.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.110
We measure this in volts.

01:13.220 --> 01:16.190
The units here are charge.

01:16.190 --> 01:24.170
So that means that if I wrote a an expression for capacitance again you would have see the capacitance

01:24.530 --> 01:32.270
again this see here refers to the charge the units of cool ohms so C would be evil equal to Q divided

01:32.270 --> 01:34.020
by the voltage.

01:34.550 --> 01:42.660
So in terms of its units the units of capacitance would be the units of Q divided by the units of volts.

01:43.340 --> 01:46.270
So we could say this is in units of cool arms.

01:46.320 --> 01:54.990
So let me just read it out here of cool arms divided by volts All right.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.910
This is something we called a fair add.

01:58.200 --> 02:07.290
We call this so one cool arm revolt is equivalent to one fair add we just kind of shorten it as FAA.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.390
Okay so the units of capacitance

02:12.130 --> 02:18.370
have to be measured in fair adds So those are the units.

02:18.380 --> 02:25.180
So typical values might be sometimes they're pretty small but say 15 micro fare add.

02:25.190 --> 02:26.370
You would read it like this.

02:26.370 --> 02:29.080
Another example might be something really small.

02:29.090 --> 02:32.700
Pico Fair at right you might measure something like this.

02:32.720 --> 02:32.920
OK.

02:32.930 --> 02:39.730
These are just kind of two examples over here of capacitance.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.040
All right.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.240
Now the other thing that's important here is we had an expression for this.

02:44.240 --> 02:53.810
However we did it for parallel plates and only for parallel plates capacitors come in different geometries

02:54.350 --> 02:57.200
one geometry is a parallel plate.

02:57.200 --> 03:05.140
In that case the capacity to see you can write it as Epsilon 0 multiplied by a over D.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.520
You can actually put a bracket around this thing because I want to show you two different terms.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.460
This here is the constant right the permitted city of free space it's only a number.

03:15.590 --> 03:17.340
We looked at up in the book.

03:17.510 --> 03:21.350
This is associated to what is between the plates

03:24.790 --> 03:26.380
if there's nothing between the plates.

03:26.410 --> 03:27.220
That's the value

03:31.880 --> 03:33.040
I'm going to see later on.

03:33.040 --> 03:40.080
If we put a piece of glass wood or a dielectric an insulating material I can change the capacitance.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.870
But for now we have nothing or just air between the plates.

03:43.940 --> 03:45.920
So that's simply a number.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.260
The next term right here look what it has for the parallel plate.

03:49.370 --> 03:57.440
It has the area of the plate right the area and the other thing was the distance the distance d between

03:57.440 --> 04:07.360
the plates so this here really only depends on the geometry of the capacitor of the device that we're

04:07.800 --> 04:11.900
now we have to store charge OK.

04:11.920 --> 04:17.320
So it really depends only on two things the capacitance and although this is the formula for parallel

04:17.320 --> 04:25.570
plates if we looked at different examples of capacitors Another example would be kind of tubes.

04:25.570 --> 04:33.060
If I had like a tube and on the outside here I would have another kind of a shell.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.530
You can use an example like this as a capacitor.

04:36.530 --> 04:42.920
In this case here the outside might have a charge q the inside conductor might have a charged negative

04:42.920 --> 04:52.850
Q there would be some voltage v between the inside conductor and the outside conductor the capacitance

04:52.850 --> 05:00.320
of this device can be written or the charge is directly proportional to the voltage between both of

05:00.320 --> 05:02.570
those conductors.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.570
Now you'd have a different formula for capacitance.

05:05.570 --> 05:09.440
It would be more complicated because of the geometry is more complicated.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.320
However it would still only depend on two things.

05:13.340 --> 05:18.690
It would depend on what is between both of those conductors is it airfield or is there something else.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.160
And it would depend on the geometry.

05:21.230 --> 05:25.320
What is the radius for example of these tubes.

05:25.430 --> 05:31.550
So again capacitance depends on what's between the plates and the geometry of the object that you're

05:31.550 --> 05:33.170
looking at.

05:33.170 --> 05:37.890
It does not depend on the charge or the voltage right.

05:37.890 --> 05:44.130
You don't see charger voltage actually in this expression for capacitance capacitance is just the constant

05:44.130 --> 05:47.430
of proportionality between charge and voltage.
