00:00.180 --> 00:05.640
I now want to consider what happens when I play something between the plates of a capacitor in this

00:05.640 --> 00:12.060
case let's just keep the discussion to parallel play capacitors on the material that I'm going to place

00:12.120 --> 00:17.310
is something called a dielectric and that is just another word for an insulating material.

00:17.310 --> 00:18.820
So it's not a conductor.

00:19.020 --> 00:24.300
You don't want a conductor between the parallel plates because then the charge is just going to leave.

00:24.330 --> 00:29.040
So you want the charge to remain there so it has to be a material that doesn't conduct electricity very

00:29.040 --> 00:29.990
well.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.680
One example of that is rubber.

00:31.680 --> 00:33.970
You can have plastic paper wood.

00:34.080 --> 00:38.390
Again things that are they don't let the Chargers move across.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.300
All right.

00:39.390 --> 00:45.240
Now if I consider just this simple case where I have some charge on each plate.

00:45.300 --> 00:52.110
All right here's the illustration down here in the left figure and I have a way that I've measured the

00:52.110 --> 00:57.870
voltage between those plates so I use a meter over here and I've charged the plates using a battery

00:58.260 --> 01:04.010
and I get a certain reading on that dial the capacitance for this case again.

01:04.010 --> 01:10.220
If it's just that parallel plate capacitor we looked at this equation before it's Epsilon 0 a divided

01:10.220 --> 01:12.440
by D.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.340
Now the question is what happens when I place this material inside.

01:16.340 --> 01:23.660
Well there's always something that happens and the key is that the capacitance C always goes up whatever

01:23.660 --> 01:26.710
number I get here when there's nothing between the plates.

01:26.900 --> 01:32.590
When I play something between the plates the capacitance always increases it will never go down.

01:32.610 --> 01:39.020
So let me write that down capacitance will increase

01:42.360 --> 01:43.870
always.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.360
So how much does it go.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.410
Does it increase by.

01:46.440 --> 01:51.490
Well it kind of depends on what you place in that between the parallel plates.

01:51.750 --> 01:54.820
So all of these materials are rubber plastic wood.

01:54.820 --> 01:55.240
Okay.

01:55.350 --> 02:00.060
They're all characterized with something called a dielectric constant.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.440
Let me highlight this point.

02:01.530 --> 02:10.310
The dielectric constant is usually given by the letter K or Kappa and it is dimension less it's just

02:10.310 --> 02:11.550
the number.

02:11.550 --> 02:18.780
Okay so this dielectric constant I mean just write it as K Number One is it's always bigger equal to

02:18.780 --> 02:26.390
one if it's air the capacitance sorry the dielectric constant for air is very very close to one.

02:27.330 --> 02:30.390
So that's why it behaves just like this.

02:30.390 --> 02:37.050
So when you place the dielectric constant between the plates the capacitance increases we said and the

02:37.050 --> 02:40.200
new capacitance is given by this equation.

02:40.350 --> 02:46.450
See when there is a dielectric inside is equal to the dielectric constant.

02:46.710 --> 02:51.010
Again multiplied by the capacitance when there's nothing between the plates.

02:51.090 --> 02:54.610
So I'm gonna call this C0 when there's nothing between the plates.

02:54.690 --> 03:00.750
So the new capacitance is written as dielectric constant multiplied by the value of the capacitance

03:00.750 --> 03:03.820
when it's air filled or nothing between the plates.

03:03.840 --> 03:11.940
Ok so this is really the key equation and again that dielectric constant is always bigger than one.

03:11.940 --> 03:18.040
Which means if I multiply this by the original capacities I'm always going to get something bigger.

03:18.060 --> 03:18.480
OK.

03:18.570 --> 03:20.400
So why is that.

03:20.700 --> 03:24.900
And the other question is kind of what happens to the voltage between the plates.

03:24.930 --> 03:30.250
You can see here if I kept everything connected and I have some charge between the plates.

03:30.390 --> 03:33.680
Look what happened to the reading right.

03:33.700 --> 03:36.220
We had a voltage drop over here right.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.780
V went down a little bit.

03:37.780 --> 03:39.780
It used to be at the maximum value.

03:39.790 --> 03:47.020
Now it's kind of gone down a little bit and it's going to go down by the dielectric constant.

03:47.320 --> 03:52.570
And to really understand this you really have to look at what's happening to that material when you

03:52.570 --> 03:54.500
place it between the plates.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.250
Again we talked about this before.

03:56.740 --> 04:03.550
And again the atoms although they're neutral they can still spread out right the positives and the negatives

04:03.550 --> 04:08.680
are going to go in different directions because there's an electric field inside that material.

04:08.680 --> 04:13.220
So let me draw a kind of one big atom so we can see what's going to happen.

04:13.270 --> 04:17.230
It was a neutral atom except the positive side's going to end up here.

04:17.410 --> 04:22.390
And the electrons are going to end up closer to the positive plates.

04:22.480 --> 04:26.770
So there's charged separation we say there is a polarization now.

04:27.210 --> 04:28.720
So if you have a look at it now.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.450
So we had a voltage between the plates.

04:31.450 --> 04:38.290
However look what happens right we have the voltage which is due to both of those.

04:38.310 --> 04:40.360
However now look what happens.

04:40.470 --> 04:45.540
We also have some positive charges that are going to be close to those negatives.

04:45.540 --> 04:52.620
It basically reduces the potential difference between the plates on this side here you got negatives

04:52.620 --> 04:54.240
that are really close to the positive.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.820
So they have some voltage between them.

04:57.270 --> 05:03.390
So at the end the total voltage is going to end up dropping because you end up canceling out some of

05:03.390 --> 05:08.730
these positive charges on the plates with the negative charges from the material that are really close

05:08.730 --> 05:09.050
to it.

05:10.320 --> 05:10.530
All right.

05:10.530 --> 05:15.900
So the net voltage is always a voltage drop when I have charged plates and I stick something between

05:15.900 --> 05:16.070
them.
