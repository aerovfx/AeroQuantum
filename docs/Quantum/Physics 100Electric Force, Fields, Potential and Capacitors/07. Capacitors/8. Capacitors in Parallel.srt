WEBVTT

00:00.090 --> 00:03.570
All right I want to now look at a different way of connecting to capacitors again.

00:03.570 --> 00:10.140
We're gonna have the same voltage 10 volts same two capacitors except now we've connected them slightly

00:10.140 --> 00:16.680
differently I've defined some points A B that's points on different sides of the plates for capacitor

00:16.680 --> 00:24.690
C one and point C and D are just on both sides of capacitor C two again the same questions we would

00:24.690 --> 00:27.390
have how much charges on each capacitor.

00:27.480 --> 00:36.420
So what is kind of Q1 what is Q2 again what is the voltage across the first capacitor and what is the

00:36.420 --> 00:41.100
voltage across the second capacitor how do we use our equations.

00:41.160 --> 00:45.180
So the first thing to notice is that this is what we say.

00:45.270 --> 00:52.730
This is a parallel configuration here in parallel because it's actually different wires right.

00:52.730 --> 00:56.710
There's different parts for each capacitor.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.580
They're connected by a different wire.

00:58.590 --> 01:00.460
They're not one right after another.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.550
So we say that these are in parallel with each other.

01:02.550 --> 01:06.500
You can see they kind of form parallel lines depending on how you draw them.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.700
So what we can do is for each capacitor is we can write down our equation.

01:10.710 --> 01:17.490
We can write that the charge on this first one has to be equal to see one multiplied by V1 you have

01:17.490 --> 01:27.960
to have this charge on Q2 capacitors C2 is Q Q2 and that has to be equal to the value of the capacitor

01:28.380 --> 01:30.250
multiplied by V.

01:30.330 --> 01:34.780
We're going to take the same values here we just want to see what's the difference between both cases.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.000
So this is kind of really equation 1.

01:37.080 --> 01:42.390
And although there's two equations here again both of these expressions have to be true.

01:42.480 --> 01:48.660
So all I know right now is I know the value of C1 and C2 So what happens now.

01:48.670 --> 01:53.010
What about the voltage across each capacitor.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.320
OK so this case is a little bit different.

01:55.340 --> 02:03.440
So in this case here the voltage across each capacitor v 1 has to be equal to V 2 and also has to be

02:03.440 --> 02:06.460
equal to V the voltage across the battery.

02:06.530 --> 02:13.370
Again this is a wire this whole side here is connected to the positive terminal of the battery which

02:13.370 --> 02:17.120
means this is all an equity potential it's a complicated looking conductor.

02:17.150 --> 02:22.010
There's a plate here there's a plate here but again they're all connected over here.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.520
Likewise on this side.

02:23.730 --> 02:24.310
Right.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.120
If this is at a negative voltage.

02:26.360 --> 02:32.150
Everything here has to be at the same negative voltage so you have to have the same positive voltage

02:32.150 --> 02:32.900
everywhere here.

02:32.900 --> 02:37.100
Same negative voltage as the battery for each case.

02:37.100 --> 02:37.320
All right.

02:37.320 --> 02:44.570
And this is true if they're in parallel with each other you'll always have the same voltage across parallel

02:44.570 --> 02:46.430
branches all right.

02:46.430 --> 02:51.650
So now we can actually calculate how much charge there is on each plate because I know the value of

02:51.650 --> 02:55.980
the capacitance and I also know that the voltage now is going to be 10 volts.

02:56.060 --> 03:01.940
So right away you can go back to my first equations this year would be ten times tend to the negative

03:01.940 --> 03:06.120
six fair add multiplied by 10.

03:06.620 --> 03:14.060
So I would have I'm just gonna write this as one hundred again micro Q Long How about on the second

03:14.060 --> 03:22.610
one you have 40 TIMES 10 TO THE NEGATIVE six and multiplied by again ten volts means you have to have

03:22.610 --> 03:29.870
400 micro columns okay and the voltage is going to be ten for each one.

03:29.870 --> 03:36.950
So V1 is 10 volts the two is equal to 10 volts and that's it you're all done for this one.

03:37.760 --> 03:43.420
Actually the other thing we could do though is represent this using an equivalent circuit.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.060
Nice thing about equivalent circuits is they're simpler.

03:48.290 --> 03:54.920
So again we're gonna use the same battery and I'm going to represent it now using a different capacitor

03:55.370 --> 04:01.940
that I want to simplify to and just represented as one equivalent capacitor the way that you do this

04:01.940 --> 04:05.120
now is through this.

04:05.120 --> 04:13.040
So the equivalent capacitor is C equivalent and the value now is basically simply going to be the sum

04:13.040 --> 04:18.400
of both of them it's a different equation so in this case it's simply C one plus C two.

04:18.440 --> 04:27.830
So in this example here it would be 10 micro Farad plus 40 micro Feride so C equivalent would give me

04:29.000 --> 04:31.300
50 micro ferret.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.960
What would be the charge now on this equivalent capacitor in the formula I would use for the charge

04:38.960 --> 04:43.820
on the equivalent capacitor would be C equivalent multiplied by the voltage.

04:43.820 --> 04:49.580
This is still 10 volts right here so the voltage across this capacitor has to be 10 volts at the end.

04:49.580 --> 04:54.720
If you substitute both of this in you're gonna get 50 micro grow by 10.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.230
You're going to get 500 micro cooling.

04:58.830 --> 05:04.820
It's actually what we're doing right here is we're simplifying this or representing kind of both of

05:04.820 --> 05:08.860
these plates here kind of combining them together.

05:10.350 --> 05:13.790
And we're the same thing on the other side.

05:13.920 --> 05:18.400
On the other side we're kind of combining both of those together.

05:18.510 --> 05:25.000
If I combine both of those imagine they have the same area and I stick them right next to each other.

05:25.110 --> 05:26.610
So this one has a bit of charge.

05:26.610 --> 05:28.670
This one however has a bit of charge.

05:28.830 --> 05:33.460
The total charge that you end up getting on this plate right here.

05:34.080 --> 05:42.510
I would read it as something like this that the total charge is equal to Q1 plus Q2 and we calculated

05:42.510 --> 05:48.770
both of those you could see that the number I just calculated using the equivalent capacitor is 500

05:48.780 --> 05:49.960
micro cooling.

05:50.200 --> 05:56.240
And again that's the number I would get if I would sum up the charges from each one one hundred micro

05:56.240 --> 06:03.070
cool on plus 400 micro cooling gives me 500 micro cooling.

06:03.690 --> 06:14.050
So again the key point for capacitors in parallel the voltage is the same that's really the key.

06:14.470 --> 06:20.260
If you want to represent it using an equivalent capacitor all you have to do is you simply have to sum

06:20.260 --> 06:22.250
up the different values.

06:23.050 --> 06:27.190
If there's three of them that are in parallel with each other I would simply add another term over here

06:28.240 --> 06:30.480
to calculate the charge on each one.

06:30.640 --> 06:36.370
Again since the voltage is the same it's pretty straightforward if you know the values in the last part

06:36.370 --> 06:43.380
is that my equivalent capacitor has a total charge equal to Q1 plus Q2.
