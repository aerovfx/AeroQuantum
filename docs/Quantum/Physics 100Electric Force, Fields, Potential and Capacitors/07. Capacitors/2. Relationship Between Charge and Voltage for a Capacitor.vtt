00:00.120 --> 00:04.440
Let's see what we know about capacitors so far what I have here is a positively charged plate and a

00:04.440 --> 00:06.040
negatively charged PLATE.

00:06.150 --> 00:09.380
THE ELECTRIC FIELD BETWEEN THE PLATES goes like this.

00:09.570 --> 00:11.010
And again on the outside.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.950
Let's try a different color over here on the outside.

00:13.950 --> 00:16.540
We should have a fringing field.

00:16.760 --> 00:22.920
It kind of looks like this again starts from the positive and ends to the negative aura and the feel

00:22.920 --> 00:27.820
on the outside gets weaker and it's stronger between the plates.

00:28.230 --> 00:35.370
The magnitude of that electric field again is written as Sigma over Epsilon 0.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.510
That's the magnitude the direction we know right here just by looking at it.

00:39.540 --> 00:47.870
So remember what sigma is Sigma is a charge density we just write this down.

00:48.170 --> 00:55.850
So it's basically the number of cool homes we have per meter squared on those plates.

00:55.890 --> 01:00.140
So if you think about it over here well we're gonna have a certain amount of charge which I'm gonna

01:00.170 --> 01:06.170
write as total charge q over here and we're gonna have basically minus the same amount of charge as

01:06.170 --> 01:07.890
the different sign on the other plate.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.690
So how would I write my surface charge density.

01:11.750 --> 01:19.400
Well here I would write as the total charge q on one of these plates divided by the area and a here

01:19.400 --> 01:23.910
again is the area of each plate.

01:23.920 --> 01:29.060
All right let's substitute that expression over here so we can write down that the magnitude of my electric

01:29.060 --> 01:37.020
field would be the total charge on one of the plates divided by a multiplied by epsilon 0.

01:37.190 --> 01:37.540
All right.

01:37.700 --> 01:41.540
And we're going to take this one last step but I want to do is I want to look for an expression for

01:41.540 --> 01:48.770
the charge the charge q here if I bring a n Epsilon zero on the other side what it ends up looking like

01:48.770 --> 01:57.530
is Epsilon 0 and then I have the area and multiplied by the magnitude of the field.

01:58.110 --> 01:58.440
Okay.

01:58.470 --> 02:02.530
Let's have a look now at an expression for the field we didn't talk about the potential.

02:02.640 --> 02:08.640
Right now if this one is positively charge and this one here is negatively charged we're going to say

02:08.640 --> 02:16.530
that the positive one is at a higher electrical potential and we call it V Plus and the negative one

02:16.530 --> 02:19.100
is at a lower electrical potential.

02:19.110 --> 02:24.170
So what we have is we have a difference of electrical potential between the positive and the negative.

02:25.120 --> 02:29.830
So in this case it would be V plus minus V minus.

02:29.880 --> 02:30.060
All right.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.110
That's the difference of potential.

02:32.310 --> 02:37.800
Now if you consider the geometry of this plate these plates here are probably separated by a certain

02:37.800 --> 02:38.460
distance.

02:38.460 --> 02:39.580
We're going to call that.

02:41.100 --> 02:47.670
So we previously saw that we can also write an expression for the electric field if we know the difference

02:47.670 --> 02:55.710
of potential and it kind of looks something like this minus delta v divided by delta x delta x was a

02:55.710 --> 02:58.690
distance over which the voltage changed over here.

02:59.070 --> 03:02.190
For now let's not worry about this negative sign right here.

03:02.190 --> 03:02.460
Okay.

03:02.490 --> 03:04.590
So I'm just going to worry about the magnitude.

03:04.920 --> 03:10.540
So let's just do this on the negative side remember just tells us the direction.

03:10.540 --> 03:16.050
So at the end I can write this at least for this particular problem the change of voltage over here

03:16.050 --> 03:24.540
is simply delta v what I call delta v right here and now divided by well what is this distance over

03:24.540 --> 03:31.190
here where this voltage is changing the distance is going to be the distance between the plates I'm

03:31.200 --> 03:33.610
going to call that D.

03:34.370 --> 03:39.540
Okay so now what I could do is I could take my expression for the electric field and I could substitute

03:39.540 --> 03:44.100
it right over here in the charge equation that I had.

03:44.100 --> 03:47.640
All right so let's go and do that one more step.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.670
Epsilon 0 a.

03:50.880 --> 04:00.960
Again here I'm gonna have Delta V voltage between the plates and divided by the All right.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.600
So this is actually a very very important equation right here.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.560
So you're going to write it one more time.

04:05.670 --> 04:11.580
I just want to group some of the terms together to put a square bracket in over here I'm gonna call

04:11.580 --> 04:13.120
this delta V.

04:13.890 --> 04:16.120
This term right here.

04:16.470 --> 04:17.010
All right.

04:17.010 --> 04:24.240
And over D let me put a box around this actually very very important equation.

04:24.470 --> 04:30.440
What it says again in the charge q remember It's Q on one plate and the opposite charge on the other

04:30.440 --> 04:30.680
plate.

04:30.680 --> 04:31.770
That's what this charge means.

04:31.780 --> 04:38.480
So if it's positive three cool ohms over here negative three columns on the other one delta v is the

04:38.480 --> 04:41.950
difference of potential between both of those plates.

04:41.990 --> 04:50.850
Sometimes this here is written in textbooks sometimes if you look at it's written as simply v OK.

04:51.200 --> 04:56.720
Sometimes they drop the delta but what they really mean is the difference between the voltage between

04:56.720 --> 04:59.110
both plates.

04:59.150 --> 05:07.010
So actually this is a very very general equation which says that the charge is actually always proportional

05:07.010 --> 05:13.850
to the voltage between the plates and the constant of proportionality between the plates is something

05:13.850 --> 05:17.010
we call the capacitance.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.270
Okay so this is actually really really important.

05:20.270 --> 05:25.340
So let me write this over here so C is a value we call the capacitance

05:29.010 --> 05:34.240
so it's the constant of proportionality between the charge and the voltage.

05:34.320 --> 05:39.570
So for this parallel plate capacitor What is that constant of proportionality.

05:39.570 --> 05:42.750
Well it's going to be the term in the square bracket right here.

05:42.840 --> 05:50.190
So for the parallel plate we have that the capacitance is simply written as Epsilon 0 the area and divided

05:50.190 --> 05:57.000
by the distance between the plates the formula right here that I'm gonna call the formula here in this

05:57.000 --> 06:03.420
green box this is true for any type of capacitance.

06:03.760 --> 06:09.580
It doesn't necessarily only apply to parallel plates what applies to parallel plates is this value right

06:09.580 --> 06:10.890
here in the bottom.

06:10.930 --> 06:17.050
I put it in a purple All right this here applies to parallel plates.

06:19.130 --> 06:24.530
But this expression right here in the green box is actually quite general so we're typically always

06:24.530 --> 06:29.520
going to have that the charge is proportional to the voltage between the plates.

06:29.530 --> 06:32.370
All right so we're gonna be using this equation quite a bit.

06:33.370 --> 06:38.860
So that means if I double the voltage between the plates I'm going to have twice as much charge.
