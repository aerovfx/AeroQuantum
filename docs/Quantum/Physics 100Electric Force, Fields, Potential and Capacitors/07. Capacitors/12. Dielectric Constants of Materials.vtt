00:00.150 --> 00:00.420
All right.

00:00.450 --> 00:06.780
So here I've got a table with some different materials in their dielectric Constance again.

00:06.810 --> 00:10.710
Let's assume we have just parallel plates.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.690
I mean draw em over here.

00:12.950 --> 00:13.390
OK.

00:13.400 --> 00:19.450
And again the value in air is going to be Epsilon 0.

00:19.460 --> 00:23.730
The area divided by the distance between them.

00:23.870 --> 00:30.290
Now when there is a capacitor or sorry when there is a dielectric inside we know that the capacitance

00:31.300 --> 00:37.250
let's call it C with a little subscript K is going to be k multiplied by c 0.

00:37.570 --> 00:43.330
And it becomes K Epsilon 0 the area divided by the distance.

00:43.390 --> 00:46.670
Let's look at these different materials over here.

00:47.290 --> 00:51.510
So air the value is like 1 point 0 0 0 5 9.

00:51.520 --> 01:00.490
So basically 1 actually if you look down here vacuum vacuums also on the list there is vacuum the value

01:00.490 --> 01:01.680
is 1 for vacuum.

01:01.690 --> 01:07.780
So you can see if I put nothing if I take the air out or if I keep the air in the dielectric constant

01:07.780 --> 01:10.660
is basically the same value.

01:10.660 --> 01:16.420
Have a look at some other kind of common materials a rubber rubber has a dielectric constant of six

01:16.420 --> 01:17.860
point seven.

01:17.880 --> 01:18.030
Right.

01:18.040 --> 01:25.950
So if I filled if I fill that space with rubber colored in red here.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.430
So if this here was rubber

01:30.220 --> 01:32.690
again let me kind of draw it out.

01:32.860 --> 01:40.570
Rubber the way I would calculate the capacitance of this object here would be.

01:40.770 --> 01:47.340
Well again I would use the dielectric constant for rubber so I would use six point seven and then multiplied

01:47.340 --> 01:53.010
by the capacitance when there is nothing between the plates Epsilon 0 a divided by D so you could see

01:53.010 --> 02:00.240
I've increased the capacitance now here's some other materials paper three point seven is the value

02:00.750 --> 02:06.180
let's highlight that one this one you can kind of do labs sometimes in school you end up doing a lab

02:06.180 --> 02:12.720
like this with paper between because it's very easy to insert paper between the plates what else.

02:12.810 --> 02:17.610
Look at some of the larger values right I don't know what this strontium Titan 8 that's a really big

02:17.610 --> 02:19.030
value right.

02:19.070 --> 02:20.330
Two hundred and thirty three.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.290
That's incredible.

02:22.290 --> 02:26.750
That's a very very large increase in the capacitance all right.

02:26.770 --> 02:34.030
So the capacitance really always goes up when I increase a dielectric between the plates and what does

02:34.030 --> 02:38.110
that mean actually in terms of our equations that we saw.

02:38.180 --> 02:45.310
Well number one thing that it means is if I connect this to a battery what's going to happen if the

02:45.310 --> 02:52.480
voltage of the battery is V and I've increased the capacitance now it means I'm going to store more

02:52.480 --> 02:53.260
charge

02:58.800 --> 03:00.480
so that's what it really allows us to do.

03:00.480 --> 03:07.170
So for rubber I'd really be allowed to store almost seven times more charge on the plates than if I

03:07.170 --> 03:09.600
didn't have a dielectric between them.
