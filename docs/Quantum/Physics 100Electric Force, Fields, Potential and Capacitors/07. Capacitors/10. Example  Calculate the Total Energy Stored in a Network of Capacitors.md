# Example  Calculate the Total Energy Stored in a Network of Capacitors

## 07. Capacitors

### Tóm tắt nội dung

In this example here I have a network of three different capacitors. And my goal is to tính toán what is the total energy stored in all of the capacitors. Được. Again it's connected to a 9 volt battery. Vậy what I would do for this problem Đúng here is I would probably want to simplify this and if I can somehow simplify this and replace it with one effective circuit with a 9 volt battery let's kind of redraw it here. If I can represent this complicated circuit with one tụ điện except it's going to be one equivalent tụ điện which I'll have to use my rules in order to apply. Được rồi. Vậy I'd still have the same battery and over here this is going to be some equivalent điện dung of this entire network. And then this would be very easy to tính toán how much energy is stored if I have this as the electrical energy again if I know the điện dung it would just be one half CV bình phương. And this here would be the equivalent điện dung in V would be 9 Vôn between the plates over there. Được rồi. Vậy let's see how chúng ta có thể simplify this network. Vậy I'm gonna do it in two stages. The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to simplify everything here in this dashed orange line here what chúng ta có are two capacitors in parallel Vậy if it's in parallel you remember the rule for the equivalent điện dung. Vậy again it's only representing simplifying both of those. The rule if they're in parallel. Call the C equivalent one is going to be equal to. You simply have to add them up Đúng. C one plus C two that is the rule if they're in parallel. Vậy Trong trường hợp này it's straightforward it's simply ten plus 40. Again everything here is in microfiber Ed Vậy I would get 50 micro fare add for the equivalent điện dung of this. Vậy Bây giờ what I have is I have a simplified circuit in which I have a tụ điện like this and an equivalent tụ điện which I just calculated Vậy I've simplified that considerably. This one here is 50 micro Fara. And the first one I haven't touched that one yet. This one is still 20 micro fare. It's still the same one is over here. Vậy Bây giờ how would I simplify both of those. Again this is really the last step Đúng. I want this circuit to represent it by this guy Đúng here. Vậy how do I tính toán the equivalent điện dung Trong trường hợp này. This is the final value. Again I'm going to use the rule because these are in series with each other. Vậy if I want to tính toán the điện dung of two điện dung in series what I have to do is use the other phương trình to one divided by the equivalent điện dung is one divided by twenty plus one divided by 50. Again everything here is in micro Feride. Được rồi. To evaluate this what I'm going to do is just maybe put it on a common denominator. A hundred is a common denominator. Vậy what I would do would be this would be five over one hundred plus two over one hundred. Được rồi. Vậy at the end this gives me seven over one hundred. But again I remember I have to flip the fractions Vậy see equivalent is 100 divided by seven. You put that in the calculator you should get something that is roughly 14 micro Feride. Được rồi. Vậy that is the equivalent điện dung Đúng here. Vậy that's it. Bây giờ I know everything. If I want to find the total energy one half the equivalent điện dung is 14. And Bây giờ I want to get a number in jewels Vậy I will evaluate what the micro is. And then the hiệu điện thế Trong trường hợp này it's connected to a nine volt battery. And I have to square that value. Được rồi again you put that in the calculator. Let me go ahead and do that one. A nine bình phương is eighty one in times while 14 e to the negative six and then multiplied by one half I'm kind of doing it backwards here I get five point six seven multiplied by ten to the negative four and that there is measured in Joules. Here is the total energy. And again it's electrical energy stored in all of these three capacitors. This is how much energy had to be supplied by this battery in order to điện tích these capacitors.
