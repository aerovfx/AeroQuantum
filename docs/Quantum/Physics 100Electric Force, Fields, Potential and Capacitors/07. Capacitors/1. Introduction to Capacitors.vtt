Hi guys.

00:00.690 --> 00:05.340
So in this section we're going to review properties of capacitors.

00:05.340 --> 00:10.380
I've got a figure here that shows you all kinds of various capacitors.

00:10.430 --> 00:12.660
There are two terminal devices.

00:12.660 --> 00:12.960
OK.

00:12.960 --> 00:18.150
They come either a kind of cylindrical they could come kind of a disease flat little kind of pancake

00:18.150 --> 00:19.260
things.

00:19.260 --> 00:25.350
These ones over here are kind of some plates that you can rotate so you can kind of put the plates kind

00:25.350 --> 00:28.020
of closer together or farther apart.

00:28.080 --> 00:34.430
So there are variable capacitors the ones we're going to focus on mainly our parallel plate capacitor

00:34.430 --> 00:37.230
is just like the parallel plates we previously saw.

00:37.230 --> 00:44.120
So capacitors are simply devices that are used to store charge or to create an electric field.

00:44.130 --> 00:49.770
Another way of saying that is by storing charge we're going to say we're going to store energy in the

00:49.770 --> 00:54.010
field in the plates and then we can use that energy later on.

00:54.060 --> 00:55.730
They're also used in filtering.

00:55.740 --> 01:00.900
If you start looking at AC circuits capacitors can be used to filter signal.

01:00.920 --> 01:06.980
OK we're going to keep it rather simple for this section so we're going to introduce capacitors.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.780
There's some fundamental equation that relates the charge on the plates to the voltage between the plates

01:13.440 --> 01:19.020
and then we're going to see what happens if you place a dielectric or like a piece of paper or glass

01:19.020 --> 01:22.190
between the plates an insulator for example.

01:22.380 --> 01:24.530
What does that change what properties.

01:24.540 --> 01:25.320
Does it change.

01:25.350 --> 01:25.550
OK.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.720
So by the end of this you'll be able to answer a whole bunch of questions regarding capacitors namely

01:30.720 --> 01:37.080
how much charge there is how much voltage how much energy is stored and what type of electric field

01:37.080 --> 01:37.890
is produced.

01:38.090 --> 01:38.430
OK.

01:38.940 --> 01:39.170
All right.

01:39.210 --> 01:40.860
So let's get started with the section.
