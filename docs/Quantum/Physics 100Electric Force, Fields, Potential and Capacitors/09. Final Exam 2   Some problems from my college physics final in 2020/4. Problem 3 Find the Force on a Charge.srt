00:00.240 --> 00:00.440
All right.

00:00.450 --> 00:06.510
So here's problem three we have a grid with three point charges here giving you the magnitude the grid

00:06.510 --> 00:08.930
is one centimeter by one centimeter.

00:08.970 --> 00:14.370
So that means that this is three centimeters apart and those are two centimeters apart.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.180
And what else.

00:15.180 --> 00:22.770
So which of the following vectors we have five choices here best illustrates the direction of the total

00:22.770 --> 00:25.800
force on charge q three.

00:25.800 --> 00:26.010
All right.

00:26.010 --> 00:29.100
So here's charge q three how would be the force on charge.

00:29.100 --> 00:35.450
Q3 charge Q3 is positive and let's look at the different interactions.

00:35.480 --> 00:40.680
So we have interaction between Q2 and Q3 Q2 is negative.

00:40.680 --> 00:45.360
So that means on this one Q3 would be attracted to this one.

00:45.390 --> 00:48.870
I'm going to call this f 2 3.

00:48.870 --> 00:50.910
What else do we have.

00:51.210 --> 00:56.140
Q3 is also attracted to Q1 because Q1 is negative.

00:56.400 --> 01:02.220
So that would produce a force like this I'm going to call that f 1 3.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.860
Now if you would add both of those as vectors again if you'd add both of them as vectors you'd have

01:07.860 --> 01:10.070
to kind of go something like this.

01:10.290 --> 01:16.000
And then at the end the resulting vector would be this one this one here would be the total force on

01:16.010 --> 01:17.630
charge 3.

01:18.050 --> 01:20.220
Let's just write it as F 3 total.

01:20.220 --> 01:24.710
That would be kind of the general direction I would depend on how big each one of those.

01:25.110 --> 01:30.760
But the only one that kind of has that angle over here is kind of figure B.

01:31.150 --> 01:32.870
Mean scroll down a little bit.

01:32.910 --> 01:36.760
The last one says Just calculate how big this forces right.

01:36.780 --> 01:40.010
What is the magnitude of this.

01:40.020 --> 01:45.570
Well if you think about it for just a second so let me go kind of go back up if we know the magnitude

01:45.570 --> 01:49.600
of each of these components we should be able to find the total.

01:49.700 --> 01:49.920
Right.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.720
Because that's just Pythagorean.

01:51.720 --> 01:57.970
So F 3 total again would simply be Pythagorean theorem.

01:58.000 --> 01:58.240
All right.

01:58.260 --> 02:00.410
You find the magnitude of each one of those.

02:00.410 --> 02:08.130
So it'd be f one three squared plus F two three squared.

02:08.130 --> 02:10.230
So we have to find both of those.

02:10.230 --> 02:12.980
So let's start by finding both of those terms.

02:13.080 --> 02:16.320
So what is f 1 3 as a magnitude.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.310
Again it's k q one.

02:19.310 --> 02:23.170
Q 3 and what is the distance now between 1 and 3.

02:23.280 --> 02:29.550
What's this distance here which is 2 centimeters so zero point zero two And don't forget the square

02:29.550 --> 02:31.590
that's cool Ohm's Law.

02:31.590 --> 02:31.850
All right.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.510
So let me.

02:32.580 --> 02:37.380
Again I'm not going to worry about the positives and negatives for these charges because they only tell

02:37.380 --> 02:39.420
me the magnitude.

02:39.420 --> 02:47.550
So we have nine times 10 to the nine q 1 The magnitude is 1 nano Coolum 1 times ten to the negative

02:47.550 --> 02:48.750
nine.

02:48.750 --> 02:57.610
Q Three is for nano Coolum and all of this gets divided by that distance squared.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.020
Okay so let me do that my calculator quickly here.

03:02.070 --> 03:09.690
So this nine either the nine times one either the negative nine times for either the negative nine and

03:09.690 --> 03:12.270
divided by that distance.

03:12.270 --> 03:14.780
And don't forget to square that distance.

03:15.060 --> 03:22.820
All right at the end here I get a value that is nine times ten to the negative five.

03:22.830 --> 03:26.270
So this is a Newton's All right how about the next one.

03:26.280 --> 03:35.700
F two three so it's gonna be similar it's gonna be k and Q2 Q3 and the distance is now different.

03:35.710 --> 03:35.940
Right.

03:35.950 --> 03:42.640
Because the distance is the distance between this charge and that top charge which is now three centimeters.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.540
So this is zero point zero three squared.

03:46.540 --> 03:46.810
Okay.

03:46.820 --> 03:51.720
Again we've got a substitute an all the values nine times 10 to the nine.

03:52.180 --> 03:58.880
Q2 again the magnitude is three times 10 to the negative nine.

03:58.890 --> 04:03.550
Q3 is still four times ten to the negative nine.

04:03.550 --> 04:12.090
And all of this gets divided by distance squared three centimeters and square that term.

04:12.150 --> 04:19.350
All right let me do this one in the calculator nine either nine times three e of the negative nine times

04:19.350 --> 04:22.740
for either the negative nine in all of this.

04:22.740 --> 04:28.170
Now divided by zero point zero three squared equals.

04:28.170 --> 04:34.820
Now this guy here I get one point two times ten to the negative four Newtons.

04:34.840 --> 04:42.300
So actually this force is bigger although the distance is bigger the charges more than make up for it.

04:42.990 --> 04:46.820
So at the end what you have to do now is substitute everything into the final expression.

04:46.830 --> 04:47.130
Right.

04:47.130 --> 04:50.250
Because we got EF 3 total.

04:50.250 --> 04:55.540
The magnitude is all we're interested in for this part so let's do this.

04:55.540 --> 05:00.160
So the first force we found was nine times ten to the negative five.

05:00.170 --> 05:06.440
And I have to square that term this is just Pythagorean theorem and one point two times 10 to the negative

05:06.440 --> 05:09.420
four and I have to square that term.

05:09.420 --> 05:13.680
So let me do that one in the calculator in the last part here.

05:13.820 --> 05:18.440
Either the negative five squared in all of this.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.200
Then take the square root.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.380
All right at the end of the day I get one point five times 10 to the negative four.

05:26.510 --> 05:30.960
Then that is measured in Newtons and that is the length of this total force.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.870
This problem is pretty straightforward I think.

05:32.870 --> 05:34.160
Hopefully we're able to get that one.
