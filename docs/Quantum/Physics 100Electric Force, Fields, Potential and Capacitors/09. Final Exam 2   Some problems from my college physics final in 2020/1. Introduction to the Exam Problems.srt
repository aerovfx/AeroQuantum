Hi everybody.

00:00.890 --> 00:06.540
A physics ninja here what we're gonna do in this section over here is what I've done is I recently gave

00:06.540 --> 00:13.680
a final exam to my students in my introductory physics class at the college that I teach so that the

00:13.680 --> 00:18.840
exam was covered a lot of topics but three of the questions dealt with material in this class.

00:18.840 --> 00:23.190
So I don't want to do now is kind of let you give those problems a try.

00:23.220 --> 00:26.740
And then you can look at the video solutions but let's just look at them together.

00:26.770 --> 00:28.980
OK I see if they make sense to you.

00:28.980 --> 00:34.660
First problem I gave them was this 1 3 1 gram spheres of small balls.

00:34.770 --> 00:40.020
What we're going to do is we're going to release them from rest and they're allowed to move away from

00:40.020 --> 00:40.380
each other.

00:40.380 --> 00:45.600
First of all if you look at them they all have the same amount of charge and they're all positively

00:45.600 --> 00:47.970
charged with 10 nano columns.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.850
They're separated at initially with 1 centimeter separation and they want to know the first one what

00:53.850 --> 00:57.950
is the speed of each sphere when they're far apart.

00:58.020 --> 00:58.830
Now there's three of them.

00:58.830 --> 01:03.930
So you've got to think about what's going to happen in this problem and the next one is find the acceleration

01:03.930 --> 01:09.450
of only one of those charge when it's a certain distance after move 30 centimetres.

01:09.540 --> 01:15.360
Okay so that's kind of a nice electrostatic problem dealing with point charges dealing with energy dealing

01:15.360 --> 01:16.480
with forces.

01:16.530 --> 01:16.850
Okay.

01:16.950 --> 01:21.540
So give that problem a try again the PD f for this.

01:21.630 --> 01:24.770
These three questions is attached to this video.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.160
Let's scroll down a bit.

01:26.180 --> 01:34.040
The second question was a capacitor question and I had this network of capacitors looks rather complicated.

01:34.080 --> 01:39.730
We have five capacitors in what I have it are connected to a 10 volt battery.

01:39.780 --> 01:43.310
What I want to do now is what is the potential VAB now.

01:43.320 --> 01:46.930
If you look at the diagram the point is here the point B is here.

01:46.950 --> 01:50.880
So what would be the voltage across one capacitor.

01:50.880 --> 01:56.970
In this case at the 5 micro Feride capacitor how would you find just that voltage the voltage across

01:56.970 --> 01:58.100
the battery is 10.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.720
But it's not gonna be 10 across that one.

02:00.840 --> 02:01.030
All right.

02:01.050 --> 02:02.530
How would you solve that problem.

02:02.580 --> 02:09.840
And the last one is probably the easiest problem from my exam is we consider a 3D point charges that

02:09.840 --> 02:12.600
are spread out on this two dimensional grid.

02:12.660 --> 02:16.400
I've given you the magnitude of all of these three charges.

02:16.440 --> 02:16.760
OK.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.390
Some of them are positive.

02:18.390 --> 02:25.260
Two of them are negative and they want to say which first question is which are the following vectors

02:25.260 --> 02:28.890
represents the direction of the force on the charge.

02:28.890 --> 02:31.550
Q 3 so we're really looking at this charge.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.370
What's the best one that describes the direction of the force.

02:34.380 --> 02:40.650
If it's interacting with those two other point charges the second part is pretty straightforward.

02:40.650 --> 02:48.160
Let's calculate how big that force is what is the magnitude of that vector of the force acting on Q3.

02:48.300 --> 02:48.590
All right.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.310
So 3 kind of problems.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.510
They're not super short but given the try.

02:52.580 --> 02:55.810
See if you can apply what you learned in order to get to the final answer.

02:55.830 --> 02:57.600
Watch the video see if you've got a right.
