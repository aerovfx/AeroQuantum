WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:00.330
All right.

00:00.360 --> 00:03.120
So what I first do is consider this arrangement.

00:03.120 --> 00:10.290
Our first question here says Let's try to find the speed when there are very very far away of each one.

00:10.290 --> 00:12.150
So let's imagine what's going to happen over.

00:12.150 --> 00:13.930
So three positive spheres.

00:14.070 --> 00:19.830
Imagine we were just looking at this one so there'd be a force here between Q2 and Q3.

00:19.830 --> 00:23.550
There's also be a force between Q1 and Q3.

00:23.580 --> 00:23.820
Right.

00:23.820 --> 00:27.220
So cue 3 is going to move to the right.

00:27.240 --> 00:31.930
So after a long period of time this is going to be Q3 here.

00:31.940 --> 00:34.210
It's going to be really really far away.

00:34.230 --> 00:35.460
What about on Q1.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.170
Q1 is kind of the exact opposite.

00:37.170 --> 00:40.580
There is a repulsive force between Q1 and Q3.

00:40.780 --> 00:42.760
So maybe draw a vector like this.

00:42.900 --> 00:46.880
And there's also a repulsive force between Q3 and Q1.

00:46.900 --> 00:47.970
I would move that way.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.340
So after a long period of time I don't know how long but it would kind of be really really far away.

00:53.340 --> 00:54.940
This would be Q1.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.900
Ah what about the middle one what happens.

00:56.920 --> 01:02.590
Well there's an interaction between Q2 and Q3 just draw like this.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.900
And then there's also an interaction like this.

01:05.910 --> 01:08.190
So what's going to happen to Q2.

01:08.190 --> 01:10.290
All the charges are 10 nano Coolum.

01:10.290 --> 01:13.320
So these forces are the same.

01:13.350 --> 01:15.410
So what's going to happen to that charge.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.490
This is the really key to this problem.

01:17.490 --> 01:19.690
This one will remain stationary.

01:19.750 --> 01:20.500
OK.

01:20.610 --> 01:30.390
Because again these move out at the same rate Q1 and Q3 but Q2 will remain at the same position.

01:30.450 --> 01:30.810
All right.

01:30.810 --> 01:36.350
Now a little tip if they're asking you to solve for this speed right here.

01:36.360 --> 01:36.630
OK.

01:36.630 --> 01:44.110
The speed is a scalar quantity it's usually best to try to use energy in order to solve that.

01:44.190 --> 01:44.580
OK.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.990
So when you read a question they say speed.

01:47.250 --> 01:54.450
The first thing that comes to mind is a scalar Maybe I use an energy method or conservation of energy

01:54.450 --> 01:57.200
to solve this problem.

01:57.270 --> 01:59.850
So what type of energy is involved.

01:59.850 --> 02:04.440
Well again let's not worry about the forces for now we kind of argued what's going to happen to each

02:04.440 --> 02:07.890
one but this is how I would kind of do it right.

02:07.890 --> 02:13.830
Initially what we have is some potential energy we have some potential energy here let's call it you

02:13.830 --> 02:20.160
want to we have some potential energy here between both of those this would be say two and three and

02:20.160 --> 02:26.010
then we also have some potential energy between Q1 and Q3.

02:26.010 --> 02:29.530
So there's really three terms to the potential energy.

02:30.060 --> 02:32.940
So and initially they're stationary.

02:33.060 --> 02:40.340
So initially the kinetic energy of the total system initially has to be equal to zero.

02:40.340 --> 02:42.390
Nothing is moving.

02:42.390 --> 02:44.670
So what happens when they're far away.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.270
Again this guy here is moving like this at some speed.

02:48.270 --> 02:51.210
This guy here is gonna be moving like this at some speed.

02:51.330 --> 02:52.810
And this guy's gonna be zero.

02:53.460 --> 02:58.200
So my final condition here is that you're going to have a whole bunch of

03:00.970 --> 03:04.690
kinetic energy and you're gonna have very little potential energy.

03:04.690 --> 03:12.190
So we're gonna set this up using conservation of energy and then we're gonna solve for the speeds.

03:12.510 --> 03:13.000
Okay.

03:13.600 --> 03:19.620
So let's kind of go to a fresh page and write down our expressions for the total potential energy the

03:19.630 --> 03:21.120
total kinetic energy.

03:21.190 --> 03:25.330
All right and see how it changes from potential to kinetic in the system.

03:28.440 --> 03:28.710
All right.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.340
So this is kind of what it looks like.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.360
This is how I would write it.

03:31.390 --> 03:34.980
So I'll do kind of initial over here.

03:35.410 --> 03:37.030
What is the total energy initial.

03:37.030 --> 03:40.300
So again we have all of these different potential energy terms

03:45.380 --> 03:47.390
and initially I'll just write it like this.

03:47.570 --> 03:49.090
Initial of the system.

03:49.220 --> 03:52.460
But again I'm an across that out because this here has to be equal to zero.

03:52.470 --> 03:54.340
Nothing's moving.

03:54.470 --> 03:54.700
All right.

03:54.700 --> 03:56.580
That has to be equal to.

03:56.750 --> 04:00.020
Again what is the energy when it's out here.

04:00.020 --> 04:05.480
Well so you have to kind of think about is there any potential energy when these charges are very very

04:05.660 --> 04:06.770
far apart.

04:06.770 --> 04:11.150
For that you have to remember what the formula for potential energy between two charges it's always

04:11.150 --> 04:16.640
going to be the charge a charge B and divided by the distance.

04:16.640 --> 04:21.240
This is the equation for the potential energy between two charges a and b.

04:21.710 --> 04:22.470
OK.

04:22.490 --> 04:27.460
Again if the distance is very very far away there's not going to be any potential energy.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.020
So kind of you final of the system.

04:30.050 --> 04:31.160
I'll just write it like this

04:35.660 --> 04:39.870
this guy here has to be equal to zero because they're very very far away.

04:39.890 --> 04:43.780
So at the end all we're left with is the final kinetic energy.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.210
So how did we write the final kinetic energy.

04:46.220 --> 04:53.710
Well we have this charge that's moving so it's going to have one half mass m they're all the same mass

04:53.720 --> 04:59.210
I could just write it as M and V squared plus one half.

04:59.210 --> 05:06.320
Again this term for charged Q3 V squared notice I have the same speed here and again I'm going to have

05:06.320 --> 05:12.170
the same speed because they're identical charges they were released from ress and I have the same forces

05:12.200 --> 05:16.100
acting on each one but the forces are in the different direction.

05:16.100 --> 05:22.820
So at the end this final energy right here on this side of the equation is simply C add one half to

05:22.820 --> 05:23.300
one half.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.700
You're going to get M V squared and that's it.

05:26.810 --> 05:27.110
All right.

05:27.140 --> 05:32.020
So now we have to work over here on these three terms.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.750
Let's work on these three terms right here.

05:34.790 --> 05:36.770
Let's kind of write them out separately.

05:36.890 --> 05:37.180
OK.

05:37.250 --> 05:43.730
What you can do is this is the initial POTENTIAL ENERGY OF so let's do this one first one too what does

05:43.730 --> 05:44.680
that term look like.

05:44.690 --> 05:46.860
What's going to be my constant k.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.080
It's going to be the charge Q1.

05:49.130 --> 05:54.770
The charge Q2 and divided by what is the distance I'm going to call one centimeter the distance are

05:54.840 --> 05:58.700
again I'll convert that into meters when I substituted over here.

05:58.700 --> 05:58.870
All right.

05:58.870 --> 06:00.170
What other term do I have.

06:00.170 --> 06:04.250
I've got the interaction between 2 and 3.

06:04.250 --> 06:08.810
Notice that one's going to be the same because I have the same charges as 1 and 2.

06:08.990 --> 06:11.500
And I also have the same separation.

06:11.510 --> 06:14.180
So really those two terms are going to be the same.

06:15.350 --> 06:16.370
And what about the last one.

06:16.370 --> 06:22.730
Now I have at the interaction between 1 and 3 between 1 and 3 this is what I have I'm going to have

06:22.730 --> 06:28.190
k q one Q three this time and divided by what's the distance.

06:28.190 --> 06:34.300
Now if r is 1 centimeters of the initial distance here is going to be 2 centimeters.

06:34.310 --> 06:34.490
All right.

06:34.490 --> 06:38.070
Let me just kind of get rid of this two centimeters.

06:38.090 --> 06:43.040
So that's actually two are because I've called R is equal to one centimeter.

06:43.200 --> 06:43.460
All right.

06:43.460 --> 06:46.620
So now we've got to put it all together this is pretty straightforward.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.390
The total term here that I've highlighted in the blue simply looks like this.

06:50.390 --> 06:52.250
So there's two of those terms.

06:52.340 --> 07:01.640
So two of these terms I would write it as two K Q1 Q2 divided by R and then plus this potential energy

07:02.570 --> 07:11.330
k q one Q three divided by two are in all of this has to be equal to the final kinetic energy of the

07:11.330 --> 07:12.450
system.

07:12.830 --> 07:17.000
Again the two halves ended up can't adding up to give me one in the front.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.110
So let's scroll down here.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.390
Let's keep moving.

07:20.390 --> 07:20.840
All right.

07:20.870 --> 07:25.820
So this is simply a fraction over here I could kind of combine some of the terms remember all the charges

07:25.820 --> 07:26.800
are the same.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.870
So I can really factor that out.

07:29.980 --> 07:35.420
So you simply have K Q squared because Q1 Q2 and Q3 are all the same.

07:35.810 --> 07:37.450
Then they open up a bracket.

07:39.230 --> 07:42.310
I would be left with two over par for the first term.

07:42.400 --> 07:42.610
Right.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.830
This and this.

07:44.090 --> 07:48.690
And plus one over two are in this case.

07:48.800 --> 07:55.250
Again I kind of prefer to do the problem algebraic Lee again if I want to put things on a common denominator

07:55.250 --> 07:56.830
the common denominator is two are.

07:56.830 --> 08:01.540
So I would do this is to this you would turn into a four.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.650
All right now you could see I can add those pretty straightforward.

08:04.770 --> 08:08.080
It becomes five over two are guy.

08:08.100 --> 08:16.760
So we have five K Q squared over to r equals M B squared.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.570
All right let's go over here.

08:18.660 --> 08:23.620
I'll write down the expression for V squared and then I'm going to substitute in all the values.

08:23.800 --> 08:30.890
So I have five over to K Q squared and divided by now.

08:31.140 --> 08:37.410
Again I'm gonna have the M HERE I HAVE TO BRING THE M at the bottom are m all right so let's substitute

08:37.410 --> 08:46.800
in all our values I made that kind of large so 5 and 2 that stays the same our constant K is nine times

08:47.370 --> 08:48.530
10 to the nine.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.560
Now the charges were 10 nano Coolum.

08:50.580 --> 08:54.750
That's 10 times ten to the negative nine and you have to square every.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.430
Don't forget.

08:56.430 --> 09:03.250
Now make sure everything is in the proper units so the distance are was we define it as one centimeter.

09:03.390 --> 09:08.730
So this is going to be zero point zero one meters and then the mass.

09:08.820 --> 09:11.150
We kind of go back up to the question here.

09:11.310 --> 09:13.500
The mass here was one gram.

09:13.660 --> 09:20.080
All right so one gram would be zero point zero zero one kg.

09:20.190 --> 09:20.390
All right.

09:20.400 --> 09:26.490
So now you've got a plug in this whole thing into the calculator so let me go ahead and do that nine.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.350
Let's go.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.500
5 1/2 is 2.5 times 9.

09:30.510 --> 09:42.200
Each of the nine times ten either than negative nine squared and now divided by all those terms and

09:42.210 --> 09:45.870
I have to also divide by the mass at the end.

09:45.870 --> 09:49.560
Don't forget to take the square root of all of those terms.

09:49.610 --> 09:49.970
All right.

09:50.010 --> 09:57.650
And I do that and I get a number that is approximately zero point for seven meters per second.

09:57.680 --> 09:57.920
OK.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.150
So that is the first part of this problem.

10:00.240 --> 10:02.670
That would be the speed of each one of those again.

10:02.670 --> 10:11.830
This is only four charges 1 and 3 the charge 2 is speed of 2 would have to be 0 meters per second.

10:11.990 --> 10:12.250
OK.

10:12.260 --> 10:15.520
Because we said the force's balance for that one.

10:15.590 --> 10:15.800
All right.

10:15.800 --> 10:23.560
Part B says fine the acceleration of this charge after it moved a distance of 30 centimetres.

10:23.660 --> 10:24.020
OK.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.770
So and it's only the charge Q1 and again acceleration.

10:27.770 --> 10:33.740
So again this word is a vector accelerations of vector so it would probably use forces probably the

10:33.740 --> 10:35.030
easiest way to find it.

10:35.050 --> 10:35.300
OK.

10:35.320 --> 10:41.750
And I've sketched it out here so it started over here Q1 and then it moved 30 centimeters.

10:41.780 --> 10:46.310
But again at the same time Q3 moved 30 centimeters.

10:46.340 --> 10:50.010
So if you were going to do a free body diagram on Q1.

10:50.240 --> 10:50.510
All right.

10:50.690 --> 10:54.130
This is Q1 there's gonna be an interaction with Q2.

10:54.140 --> 10:54.300
Right.

10:54.830 --> 10:56.560
So there's gonna be a force acting on it.

10:56.570 --> 11:01.670
This will be the force of Q2 on Q1.

11:01.670 --> 11:02.820
What else.

11:02.930 --> 11:07.090
There should be another force there should be an interaction between Q3 and Q1.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.600
Now this force is going to be a little bit smaller because it's far away.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.770
This is Q3.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.420
I'll just call it three on one like this.

11:15.470 --> 11:18.710
So we have two forces there in the same direction.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.340
So they're going to add as vectors.

11:21.830 --> 11:27.500
So what I want to do is I really want to find the net force acting on Q1.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.190
For that I have to add both of those and I'm going to add them both as vectors.

11:31.200 --> 11:38.840
So at the end my net force has to be a vector like this.

11:39.020 --> 11:41.100
So let's add them both up.

11:41.150 --> 11:49.700
So this would simply be f of two on one plus F of three on one.

11:49.730 --> 11:55.680
Again this one's expected to be smaller but let's calculate it anyway just because the distance is going

11:55.680 --> 11:56.690
to be so much bigger.

11:57.140 --> 11:57.390
All right.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.540
So how would we substitute this.

11:59.540 --> 12:03.050
So this would be again using cool Ohm's law for this one.

12:03.050 --> 12:08.700
Again all of these terms are the same so Q2 Q1 this is the same charge.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.980
Now what is the distance now between Q2 and Q1.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.540
I said Q1 move 30 centimeters.

12:14.540 --> 12:18.190
That means it's going to be a distance of 31 centimeters.

12:18.230 --> 12:22.610
So right here right away I'm just going to substitute this 31 squared.

12:22.610 --> 12:30.490
I wrote it in meters right here plus K. Q3 Q1 now what is this distance.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.990
Well it's simply going to be double that distance right.

12:34.770 --> 12:40.380
If you have a look at it if this is 31 that means this other one is going to be 31.

12:40.380 --> 12:47.670
So this is simply going to be all right 62 centimeters away and you have to square that term.

12:47.670 --> 12:47.910
All right.

12:47.940 --> 12:51.960
So at the end we got a substitute in all our numbers and get one final answer.

12:52.380 --> 12:52.580
All right.

12:52.620 --> 12:54.690
So let's go ahead and keep chugging along.

12:54.690 --> 12:59.700
Here let me substitute in all the values I'm going to factor out the top term because it's the same

12:59.700 --> 13:08.310
so K Q squared and then this term here simply becomes thirty one plus one over zero point sixty two

13:08.310 --> 13:09.600
squared.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.450
All right and then I got to substitute the values.

13:11.480 --> 13:20.670
So this is nine times 10 of the nine for my k constant Q again was 10 nano Coolum ten times ten of the

13:20.670 --> 13:21.520
negative nine.

13:21.540 --> 13:27.510
Oh don't forget to square that term and then multiply by this whole term here zero point thirty one

13:27.510 --> 13:32.990
squared plus one over zero point sixty two squared.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.880
All right the last thing we have to do then define the total force and again once you know the net force

13:38.910 --> 13:46.350
you should be able to find the acceleration because it's the mass of that charge multiplied by the acceleration.

13:46.370 --> 13:48.800
All right and the mass I know is one gram.

13:48.870 --> 13:53.220
So again we're going to have one last step at the end to get the acceleration really all I have to do

13:53.220 --> 13:56.300
is divide this whole thing by the mass.

13:56.310 --> 13:56.520
All right.

13:56.550 --> 13:59.540
So let's go ahead and write down my final expression.

13:59.880 --> 14:08.550
So nine times ten to the nine 10 nano columns time to tend to the negative nine squared term in the

14:08.550 --> 14:09.480
bracket.

14:09.480 --> 14:15.560
Zero point thirty one kind of lengthy isn't it but it's lengthy but it's doable.

14:15.560 --> 14:20.220
And now don't forget I have to divide by the mass if what I'm looking for is the acceleration and the

14:20.220 --> 14:24.330
mass of that charge was 1 grams I would write it like this.

14:24.330 --> 14:24.560
All right.

14:24.570 --> 14:28.090
So now you gotta plug everything in the calculator.

14:28.690 --> 14:29.640
I'll let you do that.

14:29.670 --> 14:33.160
And at the end this is what you should get.

14:33.210 --> 14:37.820
All right assuming I did things correctly I get that this term here in the brackets should be approximately

14:37.860 --> 14:39.350
13.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.430
So then I want to multiply that by nine either the nine.

14:44.610 --> 14:56.760
Multiply that by my ten nano columns ten either the negative nine squared equals and last term is divided

14:56.760 --> 14:59.340
by zero point zero zero one.

14:59.520 --> 14:59.940
Ha.

14:59.940 --> 15:07.200
My final answer I promise is the final answer is zero point zero kind of 1 2 and this would be in meters

15:07.200 --> 15:08.210
per second squared.

15:08.210 --> 15:12.400
All right so that would be the acceleration of that one charge.

15:12.900 --> 15:13.620
Yeah not bad.
