WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:00.450
All right.

00:00.450 --> 00:02.590
Problem two is A CAPACITOR PROBLEM.

00:03.420 --> 00:07.150
So again we want to know the potential difference between those two points.

00:07.290 --> 00:14.370
And again if this is the kind of combinations of capacitors and parallel and some in series.

00:14.580 --> 00:19.500
But if this is a and b again a can move anywhere here.

00:19.530 --> 00:27.240
This is also point A and B it's going to be the same potential difference across the five versus across

00:27.240 --> 00:33.530
both of those in Part B we want to know what is the total energy stored in all capacitors.

00:34.410 --> 00:38.760
So that one's actually a little bit easier to do I think because what you can do is just replace the

00:38.760 --> 00:42.030
entire network by an equivalent capacitor.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.910
So let's kind of start by simplifying this a little bit.

00:44.910 --> 00:45.150
All right.

00:45.150 --> 00:51.390
So I'm going to take everything here let's take these both of those and combine them and form one equivalent

00:51.390 --> 00:53.910
capacitor C equivalent one.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.490
So these are in series.

00:56.490 --> 00:56.690
All right.

00:56.700 --> 01:02.850
If I have two of them that are in series if you remember the formula and series it was like this C equivalent

01:02.850 --> 01:07.290
one would be one over two I'll just write it in micro Faraday that's fine.

01:07.290 --> 01:09.620
My final answer will be a micro Farad.

01:09.750 --> 01:11.330
So this is one.

01:11.490 --> 01:20.250
So that means that C equivalent one in that blue box is equivalent to one micro Feride capacitor OK.

01:20.270 --> 01:21.320
Now what do I have.

01:21.470 --> 01:24.490
Well can I simplify this any further.

01:24.490 --> 01:26.990
What if I do this.

01:26.990 --> 01:31.690
What if I combine the blue box with the five that's out here.

01:32.090 --> 01:39.320
What we have here now I'm going to call this C equivalent to this are in parallel.

01:39.320 --> 01:39.650
Right.

01:41.240 --> 01:45.550
So if they're in parallel it's very easy All you have to do is add them up.

01:45.800 --> 01:53.930
So make sure you understand this part C equivalent to is equal to C equivalent one which is in parallel

01:53.930 --> 01:57.680
with this 5 micro add capacitor.

01:57.980 --> 02:01.160
Again everything here is in micro fair and so you get one plus five.

02:01.190 --> 02:10.160
So everything in my red dash box is simply equal to six micro Fred C equivalent to.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.900
All right what I'm going to do now is I'm going to redraw this circuit for a second.

02:13.910 --> 02:22.550
So let me just redraw this battery and now all I have I'm going to have a one micro Feride what happens

02:22.550 --> 02:24.590
to everything over here.

02:24.710 --> 02:30.350
Again I've just replaced that by an equivalent six micro Feride capacitor.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.830
So this is six micro Feride.

02:32.880 --> 02:38.860
This here is one micro Fair at and at the bottom I still have my three I haven't touched that.

02:38.930 --> 02:43.360
So is there a way to replace these three into one.

02:43.690 --> 02:50.600
Again what we have here are three capacitors that are forgot the drop capacitor that are in series.

02:50.600 --> 02:59.870
So the final step is really one divided by C total is going to be equal to one over one plus one over

02:59.870 --> 03:01.970
three plus one over six.

03:01.970 --> 03:05.650
Right that is the rule for combining these three.

03:05.870 --> 03:10.550
And if I do that what I'm left with at the end is a 10 volt battery

03:13.130 --> 03:22.870
with just one single capacitor and the value of that total capacitance right here is going to be C total.

03:22.880 --> 03:27.050
All right so I've got to do a bit of math over here what I would do is maybe put things on a common

03:27.050 --> 03:32.420
denominator so let's maybe choose six so one over one would be six over six.

03:32.690 --> 03:35.780
And this guy here would be two over six.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.970
So this is easy to combine.

03:38.090 --> 03:47.060
I just add up all of these I get nine to nine over six which is kind of the same thing as three over

03:47.070 --> 03:48.150
two.

03:48.410 --> 03:53.330
Again at the end no I got to flip it around because this is one divided by C total.

03:53.330 --> 03:56.790
So my total capacitance at the end would be two thirds.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.020
And this here is in my girlfriends.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.790
Don't forget.

04:00.880 --> 04:06.290
So this is the equivalent capacitance of the entire network.

04:06.290 --> 04:06.710
All right.

04:06.870 --> 04:09.610
Let me just kind of draw an arrow right here.

04:09.650 --> 04:09.890
All right.

04:09.910 --> 04:14.060
So let's kind of start with B and then we'll work back to a it really doesn't matter but I kind of like

04:14.060 --> 04:15.760
this approach a little bit.

04:15.860 --> 04:19.220
So what is the total energy stored in a capacitor.

04:19.220 --> 04:24.650
Well if you remember the total energy stored if I only have this simple circuit over here the potential

04:24.650 --> 04:29.010
energy stored I can write it as 1 1/2 Q V.

04:29.130 --> 04:34.580
There's three different ways of writing this Formula One way it was like this CV squared.

04:34.580 --> 04:39.240
I know the value of c I know the value of V has to be ten.

04:39.290 --> 04:42.100
This is probably the best way of doing it.

04:42.170 --> 04:42.490
All right.

04:42.500 --> 04:51.950
So the potential energy so for Part B I would write the potential energy is 1 1/2 C total and V squared.

04:51.950 --> 04:56.710
You don't have to find the energy stored in each capacitor that would be a little bit more work.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.470
I'd have to find the capacitance of each one and the voltage across each one.

05:01.560 --> 05:01.760
All right.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.010
But right now this is it.

05:03.010 --> 05:08.990
Now again I want to get a number in jewel so this is going to be two thirds two thirds zero point six

05:08.990 --> 05:17.250
six times 10 to the negative six because it's in micro Fred and then multiplied by right here 10.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.230
And I have to square it.

05:19.430 --> 05:19.700
All right.

05:19.730 --> 05:28.310
So you're going to get 100 here 100 times this will take two exponents away so this will be times 10

05:28.310 --> 05:29.410
to the negative four.

05:29.930 --> 05:36.260
And it will be zero point three three times 10 to the negative four that will be measured in Joules.

05:36.260 --> 05:36.470
All right.

05:36.490 --> 05:38.850
So that is that part.

05:38.900 --> 05:39.170
All right.

05:39.200 --> 05:45.250
So now let's go back and find the voltage here between points A and B how do we do that now.

05:45.260 --> 05:50.660
Well again I think it's kind of useful to use one of these intermediate steps.

05:50.660 --> 05:55.720
We first started by finding the blue value which was one micro Feride.

05:55.790 --> 06:00.220
However the voltage A and B is going to be the same across both of those we said.

06:01.400 --> 06:08.090
It's also going to be the same voltage across the equivalent capacitor of this network.

06:08.090 --> 06:11.390
So A and B is really right here.

06:11.440 --> 06:11.680
All right.

06:11.680 --> 06:18.300
Make sure you understand that part because we've combined everything here therefore the potential that

06:18.300 --> 06:24.260
we're looking for is really what would be the electrical potential across an equivalent six microfiber

06:24.330 --> 06:25.760
add capacitor.

06:25.770 --> 06:32.880
So for this simplified circuit here we have three capacitors in series if they are in series remember

06:32.880 --> 06:35.700
that the charge is the same on each plate

06:38.620 --> 06:40.580
and that is really the important thing.

06:40.580 --> 06:46.370
So if you know the charge on the one micro Feride capacitor I would read it like this.

06:46.370 --> 06:50.220
Q One is equal to well one micro Feride.

06:50.510 --> 06:55.510
Let's just call it C one multiplied by the voltage across that well let's call it V 1.

06:57.170 --> 07:02.480
What else the charge on the six micro Feride capacitor has to be the same.

07:03.830 --> 07:11.720
This here would have to be the capacitance C6 6 micro faired capacitor in the voltage across the voltage

07:11.720 --> 07:14.100
across is really what I'm trying to find here.

07:14.150 --> 07:22.170
This is really VAB and it has to be the same thing the same charge on the three micro Feride capacitor.

07:22.280 --> 07:30.230
So it's the value of the capacitance multiplied by the voltage across the three micro Farad capacitor

07:31.440 --> 07:31.730
All right.

07:31.740 --> 07:35.510
So that gives us relationships here between these voltages right.

07:35.520 --> 07:44.070
For example the voltage V1 is you simply related to the voltage a B so use the first two part.

07:44.070 --> 07:47.960
So it'd be C6 that's 6 micro Feride capacitor.

07:48.090 --> 07:50.320
And here I have to divide by 1.

07:50.370 --> 07:55.680
Okay so the voltage v 1 is 6 times VAB.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.660
So that's kind of a useful relationship.

07:58.870 --> 07:59.730
Oh how else.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.340
What about V3.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.430
The voltage across the three micro Feride capacitor.

08:05.430 --> 08:13.080
Again if I just use the last two parts here I could write an expression and related to the voltage across

08:13.080 --> 08:14.360
the six.

08:14.550 --> 08:15.650
So that's what it would look like.

08:15.660 --> 08:21.080
It would be C6 which is 6 divided by three and the voltage a B.

08:22.110 --> 08:28.480
So this here would simply be 2 2 times the voltage across a B all right.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.820
And the last thing we do now is we simply do a loop rule.

08:32.820 --> 08:36.210
If you do a complete loop the voltages must sum to zero.

08:36.330 --> 08:41.890
So you have ten here you're going to have a voltage drop a voltage drop and another voltage drop.

08:42.120 --> 08:43.510
And this is what it looks like here.

08:44.010 --> 08:49.850
So the final expression here if I do a loop again this is the circuit.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.420
We have ten.

08:51.690 --> 08:57.120
First thing we encounter is that one micro add six and three

09:04.140 --> 09:07.240
all right use cure coughs voltage law magic.

09:07.360 --> 09:12.070
I was going to start right here at this point and I do a complete loop around.

09:12.070 --> 09:19.060
First thing I would do is I would get a increase of voltage of 10 volts when I cross the battery.

09:19.060 --> 09:23.440
And then I would get a voltage drop across here we're gonna gonna call that v 1.

09:23.710 --> 09:29.650
Gonna get a voltage drop across the six micro Feride capacitor actually instead of V six where we've

09:29.650 --> 09:32.440
been calling that VAB.

09:32.440 --> 09:33.990
That's what I'm trying to find.

09:34.220 --> 09:39.470
And mine is v 3 and that there has to be equal to zero.

09:39.490 --> 09:44.590
All right we want to solve for VAB so the next thing you want to do is just use my two relationships

09:44.590 --> 09:48.140
here that I found to get rid of both of those unknowns.

09:48.250 --> 09:52.330
So that's what you have ten minus.

09:52.390 --> 09:57.190
This here is going to be instead of v 1 I'm gonna write it as six times VAB

10:00.110 --> 10:09.470
minus VAB and the last one is minus V Three V Three was two times VAB and that there has to be equal

10:09.470 --> 10:10.770
to zero.

10:10.820 --> 10:13.910
All right straight forward VAB is the only unknown here.

10:13.970 --> 10:21.110
So we have ten has to be equal to six two and one that gives me nine.

10:21.940 --> 10:22.210
All right.

10:22.220 --> 10:28.770
And my last expression the voltage between points A and B is going to be ten over nine.

10:28.880 --> 10:29.710
Okay.

10:29.820 --> 10:36.020
And that is the voltage right here if this is point A and this is point B the voltage across that capacitor

10:37.870 --> 10:42.030
the six micro Feride capacitor is ten divided by nine.

10:42.400 --> 10:49.520
If you want to get a number for that ten divided by nine gives you like one point one 1 and that's a.
