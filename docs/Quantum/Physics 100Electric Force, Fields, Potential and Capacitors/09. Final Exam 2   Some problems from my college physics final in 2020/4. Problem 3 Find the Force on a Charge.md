# Problem 3 Find the Force on a Charge

## 09. Final Exam 2   Some problems from my college physics final in 2020

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy here's problem three chúng ta có a grid with three point các điện tích here giving you the độ lớn the grid is one centimeter by one centimeter. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that this is three centimeters apart and those are two centimeters apart. And what else. Vậy which of the following vectors chúng ta có five choices here best illustrates the hướng of the total lực on điện tích q three. Được rồi. Vậy here's điện tích q three how would be the lực on điện tích. Q3 điện tích Q3 is positive and let's look at the different interactions. Vậy chúng ta có interaction between Q2 and Q3 Q2 is negative. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là on this one Q3 would be attracted to this one. I'm going to call this f 2 3. What else do chúng ta có. Q3 is also attracted to Q1 because Q1 is negative. Vậy that would tạo ra a lực like this I'm going to call that f 1 3. Bây giờ if you would add both of those as vectors again if you'd add both of them as vectors you'd have to kind of go something like this. And then at the end the resulting véctơ would be this one this one here would be the total lực on điện tích 3. Let's just write it as F 3 total. That would be kind of the general hướng I would depend on how big each one of those. But the only one that kind of has that angle over here is kind of figure B. Mean scroll down a little bit. The last one says Just tính toán how big this các lực Đúng. What is the độ lớn of this. Well if you think about it for just a second Vậy let me go kind of go back up if we know the độ lớn of each of these components we should be able to find the total. Đúng. Because that's just Pythagorean. Vậy F 3 total again would simply be Pythagorean theorem. Được rồi. You find the độ lớn of each one of those. Vậy it'd be f one three bình phương plus F two three bình phương. Vậy chúng ta có to find both of those. Vậy let's start by finding both of those terms. Vậy what is f 1 3 as a độ lớn. Again it's k q one. $Q_3$ and what is the khoảng cách Bây giờ between 1 and 3. What's this khoảng cách here which is 2 centimeters Vậy zero point zero two And don't forget the square that's cool Ohm's Law. Được rồi. Vậy let me. Again I'm not going to worry about the positives and negatives for these các điện tích because they only tell me the độ lớn. Vậy chúng ta có nine times 10 to the nine q 1 The độ lớn is 1 nano Coolum 1 times ten to the negative nine. Q Three is for nano Coolum and all of this gets divided by that khoảng cách bình phương. Được Vậy let me do that my calculator quickly here. Vậy this nine either the nine times one either the negative nine times for either the negative nine and divided by that khoảng cách. And don't forget to square that khoảng cách. Được rồi at the end here I get a value that is nine times ten to the negative five. Vậy this is a Newton's Được rồi how about the next one. F two three Vậy it's gonna be similar it's gonna be k and Q2 Q3 and the khoảng cách is Bây giờ different. Đúng. Because the khoảng cách is the khoảng cách between this điện tích and that top điện tích which is Bây giờ three centimeters. Vậy this is zero point zero three bình phương. Được. Again we've got a substitute an all the values nine times 10 to the nine. Q2 again the độ lớn is three times 10 to the negative nine. Q3 is still four times ten to the negative nine. And all of this gets divided by khoảng cách bình phương three centimeters and square that term. Được rồi let me do this one in the calculator nine either nine times three e of the negative nine times for either the negative nine in all of this. Bây giờ divided by zero point zero three bình phương equals. Bây giờ this guy here I get one point two times ten to the negative four Newtons. Vậy actually this lực is bigger although the khoảng cách is bigger the các điện tích more than make up for it. Vậy at the end what you have to do Bây giờ is substitute everything into the final expression. Đúng. Because we got EF 3 total. The độ lớn is all we're interested in for this part Vậy let's do this. Vậy the first lực we found was nine times ten to the negative five. And I have to square that term this is just Pythagorean theorem and one point two times 10 to the negative four and I have to square that term. Vậy let me do that one in the calculator in the last part here. Either the negative five bình phương in all of this. Then take the square root. Được rồi at the end of the day I get one point five times 10 to the negative four. Then that is measured in Newtons and that is the length of this total lực. This problem is pretty straightforward I think. Hopefully we're able to get that one.
