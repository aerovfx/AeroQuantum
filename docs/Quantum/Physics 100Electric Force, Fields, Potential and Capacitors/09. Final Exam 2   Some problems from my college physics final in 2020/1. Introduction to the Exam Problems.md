# Introduction to the Exam Problems

## 09. Final Exam 2   Some problems from my college physics final in 2020

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Hi everybody. A physics ninja here what we're gonna do in this section over here is what I've done is I recently gave a final exam to my students in my introductory physics class at the college that I teach Vậy that the exam was covered a lot of topics but three of the questions dealt with material in this class. Vậy I don't want to do Bây giờ is kind of let you give those problems a try. And then you can look at the video solutions but let's just look at them together. OK I see if they make sense to you. First problem I gave them was this 1 3 1 gram spheres of small balls. What we're going to do is we're going to release them from rest and they're allowed to move away from each other. First of all if you look at them they all have the same amount of điện tích and they're all positively charged with 10 nano columns. They're separated at initially with 1 centimeter separation and they want to know the first one what is the tốc độ of each hình cầu when they're far apart. Bây giờ there's three of them. Vậy you've got to think about what's going to happen in this problem and the next one is find the gia tốc of only one of those điện tích when it's a certain khoảng cách after move 30 centimetres. Được Vậy that's kind of a nice electrostatic problem dealing with point các điện tích dealing with energy dealing with các lực. Được. Vậy give that problem a try again the PD f for this. These three questions is attached to this video. Let's scroll down a bit. The second question was a tụ điện question and I had this network of capacitors looks rather complicated. chúng ta có five capacitors in what I have it are connected to a 10 volt battery. What I want to do Bây giờ is what is the thế VAB Bây giờ. If you look at the diagram the point is here the point B is here. Vậy what would be the hiệu điện thế across one tụ điện. Trong trường hợp này at the 5 micro Feride tụ điện how would you find just that hiệu điện thế the hiệu điện thế across the battery is 10. But it's not gonna be 10 across that one. Được rồi. How would you solve that problem. And the last one is probably the easiest problem from my exam is we xem xét a 3D point các điện tích that are spread out on this two dimensional grid. I've given you the độ lớn of all of these three các điện tích. OK. Some of them are positive. Two of them are negative and they want to say which first question is which are the following vectors represents the hướng of the lực on the điện tích. $Q_3$ Vậy we're really looking at this điện tích. What's the best one that describes the hướng of the lực. If it's interacting with those two other point các điện tích the second part is pretty straightforward. Let's tính toán how big that lực is what is the độ lớn of that véctơ of the lực tác dụng lên Q3. Được rồi. Vậy 3 kind of problems. They're not super short but given the try. See if you can apply what you learned in order to get to the final answer. Watch the video see if you've got a Đúng.
