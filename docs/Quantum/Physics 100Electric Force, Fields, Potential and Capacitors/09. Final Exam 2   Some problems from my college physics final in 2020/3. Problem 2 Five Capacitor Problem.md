# Problem 2 Five Capacitor Problem

## 09. Final Exam 2   Some problems from my college physics final in 2020

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Problem two is A tụ điện PROBLEM. Vậy again we want to know the thế hiệu between those two points. And again if this is the kind of combinations of capacitors and parallel and some in series. But if this is a and b again a can move anywhere here. This is also point A and B it's going to be the same thế hiệu across the five versus across both of those in Part B we want to know what is the total energy stored in all capacitors. Vậy that one's actually a little bit easier to do I think because what you can do is just replace the entire network by an equivalent tụ điện. Vậy let's kind of start by simplifying this a little bit. Được rồi. Vậy I'm going to take everything here let's take these both of those and combine them and form one equivalent tụ điện C equivalent one. Vậy these are in series. Được rồi. If I have two of them that are in series if you remember the công thức and series it was like this C equivalent one would be one over two I'll just write it in micro Faraday that's fine. My final answer will be a micro Fara. Vậy this is one. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that C equivalent one in that blue box is equivalent to one micro Feride tụ điện OK. Bây giờ what do I have. Well can I simplify this any further. What if I do this. What if I combine the blue box with the five that's out here. What chúng ta có here Bây giờ I'm going to call this C equivalent to this are in parallel. Đúng. Vậy if they're in parallel it's very easy All you have to do is add them up. Vậy make sure you understand this part C equivalent to is equal to C equivalent one which is in parallel with this 5 micro add tụ điện. Again everything here is in micro fair and Vậy you get one plus five. Vậy everything in my red dash box is simply equal to six micro Fred C equivalent to. Được rồi what I'm going to do Bây giờ is I'm going to redraw this circuit for a second. Vậy let me just redraw this battery and Bây giờ all I have I'm going to have a one micro Feride what happens to everything over here. Again I've just replaced that by an equivalent six micro Feride tụ điện. Vậy this is six micro Feride. This here is one micro Fair at and at the bottom I still have my three I haven't touched that. Vậy is there a way to replace these three into one. Again what chúng ta có here are three capacitors that are forgot the drop tụ điện that are in series. Vậy the final step is really one divided by C total is going to be equal to one over one plus one over three plus one over six. Đúng that is the rule for combining these three. And if I do that what I'm left with at the end is a 10 volt battery with just one single tụ điện and the value of that total điện dung Đúng here is going to be C total. Được rồi Vậy I've got to do a bit of math over here what I would do is maybe put things on a common denominator Vậy let's maybe choose six Vậy one over one would be six over six. And this guy here would be two over six. Vậy this is easy to combine. I just add up all of these I get nine to nine over six which is kind of the same thing as three over two. Again at the end Không I got to flip it around because this is one divided by C total. Vậy my total điện dung at the end would be two thirds. And this here is in my girlfriends. Don't forget. Vậy this is the equivalent điện dung of the entire network. Được rồi. Let me just kind of draw an arrow Đúng here. Được rồi. Vậy let's kind of start with B and then we'll work back to a it really doesn't matter but I kind of like this approach a little bit. Vậy what is the total energy stored in a tụ điện. Well if you remember the total energy stored if I only have this simple circuit over here the thế energy stored I can write it as 1 1/2 Q V. There's three different ways of writing this công thức One way it was like this CV bình phương. I know the value of c I know the value of V has to be ten. This is probably the best way of doing it. Được rồi. Vậy the thế energy Vậy for Part B I would write the thế energy is 1 1/2 C total and V bình phương. You don't have to find the energy stored in each tụ điện that would be a little bit more work. I'd have to find the điện dung of each one and the hiệu điện thế across each one. Được rồi. But Đúng Bây giờ this is it. Bây giờ again I want to get a number in jewel Vậy this is going to be two thirds two thirds zero point six six times 10 to the negative six because it's in micro Fred and then multiplied by Đúng here 10. And I have to square it. Được rồi. Vậy you're going to get 100 here 100 times this will take two exponents away Vậy this will be times 10 to the negative four. And it will be zero point three three times 10 to the negative four that will be measured in Joules. Được rồi. Vậy that is that part. Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ let's go back and find the hiệu điện thế here between points A and B how do we do that Bây giờ. Well again I think it's kind of useful to use one of these intermediate steps. We first started by finding the blue value which was one micro Feride. However the hiệu điện thế A and B is going to be the same across both of those we said. It's also going to be the same hiệu điện thế across the equivalent tụ điện of this network. Vậy A and B is really Đúng here. Được rồi. Make sure you understand that part because we've combined everything here therefore the thế that we're looking for is really what would be the electrical thế across an equivalent six microfiber add tụ điện. Vậy for this simplified circuit here chúng ta có three capacitors in series if they are in series remember that the điện tích is the same on each plate and that is really the important thing. Vậy if you know the điện tích on the one micro Feride tụ điện I would read it like this. Q One is equal to well one micro Feride. Let's just call it C one multiplied by the hiệu điện thế across that well let's call it V 1. What else the điện tích on the six micro Feride tụ điện has to be the same. This here would have to be the điện dung C6 6 micro faired tụ điện in the hiệu điện thế across the hiệu điện thế across is really what I'm trying to find here. This is really VAB and it has to be the same thing the same điện tích on the three micro Feride tụ điện. Vậy it's the value of the điện dung multiplied by the hiệu điện thế across the three micro Fara tụ điện Được rồi. Vậy that gives us relationships here between these voltages Đúng. ví dụ the hiệu điện thế V1 is you simply related to the hiệu điện thế a B Vậy use the first two part. Vậy it'd be C6 that's 6 micro Feride tụ điện. And here I have to divide by 1. Được Vậy the hiệu điện thế v 1 is 6 times VAB. Vậy that's kind of a useful relationship. Oh how else. What about V3. The hiệu điện thế across the three micro Feride tụ điện. Again if I just use the last two parts here I could write an expression and related to the hiệu điện thế across the six. Vậy that's what it would look like. It would be C6 which is 6 divided by three and the hiệu điện thế a B. Vậy this here would simply be 2 2 times the hiệu điện thế across a B Được rồi. And the last thing we do Bây giờ is we simply do a loop rule. If you do a complete loop the voltages must tổng to zero. Vậy you have ten here you're going to have a hiệu điện thế drop a hiệu điện thế drop and another hiệu điện thế drop. And this is what it looks like here. Vậy the final expression here if I do a loop again this is the circuit. chúng ta có ten. First thing we encounter is that one micro add six and three Được rồi use cure coughs hiệu điện thế law magic. I was going to start Đúng here at this point and I do a complete loop around. First thing I would do is I would get a increase of hiệu điện thế of 10 Vôn when I cross the battery. And then I would get a hiệu điện thế drop across here we're gonna gonna call that v 1. Gonna get a hiệu điện thế drop across the six micro Feride tụ điện actually instead of V six where we've been calling that VAB. That's what I'm trying to find. And mine is v 3 and that there has to be equal to zero. Được rồi we want to solve for VAB Vậy the next thing you want to do is just use my two relationships here that I found to get rid of both of those unknowns. Vậy that's what you have ten minus. This here is going to be instead of v 1 I'm gonna write it as six times VAB minus VAB and the last one is minus V Three V Three was two times VAB and that there has to be equal to zero. Được rồi straight forward VAB is the only unknown here. Vậy chúng ta có ten has to be equal to six two and one that gives me nine. Được rồi. And my last expression the hiệu điện thế between points A and B is going to be ten over nine. Được. And that is the hiệu điện thế Đúng here if this is point A and this is point B the hiệu điện thế across that tụ điện the six micro Feride tụ điện is ten divided by nine. If you want to get a number for that ten divided by nine gives you like one point one 1 and that's a.
