00:00.260 --> 00:05.960
So we saw the field produced by a single point charged Q1 has a magnitude like this.

00:06.120 --> 00:13.260
The direction is away from positive point charge and toward negative charges.

00:13.260 --> 00:13.920
All right.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.990
Now what else do we know.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.000
This is really the key this is the most important equation you're going to see in this class here is

00:21.000 --> 00:31.680
that the force on any charge q is write it out like this F as a vector is equal to.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.440
Again it's the charge that I'm looking at.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.220
I want to find the force on this charge.

00:36.220 --> 00:41.220
Q multiplied by the electric field at that position.

00:41.580 --> 00:46.080
If I know again this here is I might just make some notes.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.880
He is the electric field

00:53.670 --> 00:55.040
at position

00:58.120 --> 00:58.870
of the charge.

00:58.880 --> 00:59.290
Q

01:04.730 --> 01:06.280
All right let's look at a couple of cases here.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.360
Let's look at.

01:07.360 --> 01:12.100
Imagine we have is somebody told you there was a an electric field somewhere in space.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.100
Let's take this case right here.

01:14.570 --> 01:21.310
I'm going to assume here that somehow there is something that is producing an electric field that is

01:21.310 --> 01:22.580
like this.

01:23.290 --> 01:27.160
Now what happens if I place a positive charge right here.

01:27.160 --> 01:32.960
How would you draw the direction of the force acting on this particular charge.

01:33.340 --> 01:40.390
For now I'm going to assume that the magnitude here is one hundred newtons per Coolum and that the field

01:40.390 --> 01:41.820
is uniform.

01:41.830 --> 01:48.250
We have a constant field all right everywhere in space.

01:48.250 --> 01:54.820
The charge here that I'm going to consider is going to be a positive three Coolum charge.

01:54.820 --> 01:59.710
How would I calculate the force in which direction with the force being.

01:59.970 --> 02:05.620
Well to calculate the force I'm just going to use my equation right here right the force acting on cue

02:06.930 --> 02:14.050
let's do it in green and blue over here is simply the charge which is three multiplied by the electric

02:14.050 --> 02:18.510
field right here at this position the electric field is 100.

02:18.670 --> 02:22.990
In this case I would have a force of 300 Newtons.

02:23.170 --> 02:29.170
So what would be the direction here of the force if I look at my equation right here see the force here

02:29.170 --> 02:35.320
is a vector and it multiplies a scalar which is the charge multiplied by another vector.

02:35.320 --> 02:38.350
Remember this guy here is a vector.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.930
And again I've given you the direction of that vector.

02:41.380 --> 02:48.070
So if the charge is positive it means that the force is going to be in the same direction as the field

02:48.520 --> 02:52.740
because all I'm doing is I'm multiplying it by a positive number right here.

02:52.780 --> 02:58.160
I have a vector E which is pointing like this and I'm multiplying it by some positive number.

02:58.180 --> 02:59.700
In this case it's three.

02:59.710 --> 03:03.280
So here I would have a force that would be like this.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.300
And the magnitude of that force would be three hundred Newtons.

03:07.300 --> 03:13.250
So that way I would write this would be three hundred Newtons and maybe in the x direction.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.810
That's how I would write it as a vector.

03:15.820 --> 03:22.660
All right what if instead if I had a negative charge over here a negative charge and I place that negative

03:22.660 --> 03:25.050
charge in the same electric field.

03:25.190 --> 03:29.080
Now let's imagine that this guy here is negative five Coolum.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.410
That's the value of the charge q in this case.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.000
So how would I calculate the force.

03:35.050 --> 03:38.990
Well again if I'm only interested in the magnitude of the force.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.110
So a lot of times when I use this equation I really just put the magnitude in.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.630
So here I would just put the magnitude which is five.

03:45.640 --> 03:54.220
That's the charge and the feel that it's the feel that at this position right here is simply it's the

03:54.220 --> 03:57.110
same feel it's 100 newtons per column.

03:57.130 --> 04:02.150
So this here would be a magnitude of 500 Newtons would be the magnitude of the force.

04:02.350 --> 04:06.220
Which direction now would you actually draw that force.

04:06.220 --> 04:12.210
Well again it would have to be in this direction right here.

04:12.220 --> 04:17.990
This here would be the direction of the force the magnitude here would be 500.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.890
If you decide to put the negative sine you're going to get negative five hundred.

04:23.290 --> 04:23.910
And that's OK.

04:23.920 --> 04:29.650
That's because you assume that the positive direction is everything pointing here to the right which

04:29.650 --> 04:32.350
is why you had a little positive over here.

04:32.910 --> 04:35.170
Negative simply tells me the direction.

04:35.170 --> 04:41.420
So this means that four negative charges the force is always opposite of the electric field.

04:41.650 --> 04:42.990
So that's really really important.

04:43.920 --> 04:44.450
OK.

04:44.470 --> 04:45.820
So let's go see over here.

04:45.820 --> 04:57.800
So four positive charges four positive cues the f is parallel to the electric field.

04:58.040 --> 05:08.790
Let's write it down for negative charges for negative charges for negative cues the f is a..

05:08.790 --> 05:14.280
Parallel to electric field actually let me just right opposite.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.100
I think that's kind of clear is

05:20.090 --> 05:20.750
opposite.

05:20.870 --> 05:26.540
Exactly 180 degrees of the electric field at that position.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.080
That's kind of what this illustrates right here.
