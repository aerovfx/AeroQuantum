00:00.330 --> 00:00.620
All right.

00:00.630 --> 00:08.100
So we just kind of focused on what happens to a conducting material when you place it in an electric

00:08.100 --> 00:08.590
field.

00:08.590 --> 00:13.380
Right the electrons are going to move in the opposite direction of the electric field and you're going

00:13.380 --> 00:17.180
to have a force now acting between objects.

00:17.190 --> 00:19.550
So what happens now what if it's an insulator.

00:19.550 --> 00:24.060
What would be the difference in the kind of a very easy way of doing this is to take a just the regular

00:24.060 --> 00:30.420
comb and brush your hair a few times or what happens is some of the electrons from your hair are going

00:30.420 --> 00:32.130
to end up on the comb.

00:32.130 --> 00:39.000
So you're gonna have some additional electrons here this comb basically becomes negatively charge by

00:39.000 --> 00:43.040
picking up some of the charges from your hair as you comb your hair.

00:43.050 --> 00:46.610
Now I imagine you have some kind of pieces of paper.

00:46.740 --> 00:51.540
Again we're gonna cut them up in little squares just so they don't have a lot of weight because we want

00:51.540 --> 00:53.260
to lift them up.

00:53.310 --> 00:58.050
So is this an experiment you could do and anyway what you will notice is that these little bits of paper

00:58.350 --> 01:01.390
are going to be attracted to the comb.

01:01.410 --> 01:06.270
But why would these little bits of paper which is basically an insulating material.

01:06.270 --> 01:10.070
Why would they be attracted to a column like this.

01:10.120 --> 01:15.660
Okay so other examples of insulators so we could just write this kind of paper is kind of an obvious

01:15.660 --> 01:17.880
one glass.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.220
What else would.

01:20.220 --> 01:26.490
Lots of other materials are insulators and unlike conductors conductors have some of these free electrons

01:26.490 --> 01:28.160
that are free to move around.

01:28.290 --> 01:31.950
They're not tightly bound to the nucleus right.

01:31.980 --> 01:34.860
So they're kind of free when they're placed in electric field.

01:35.030 --> 01:40.620
They move around insulators on the other hand there are electrons are more tightly bound to the atoms

01:40.650 --> 01:46.420
so they're not kind of free to move around but you still get this force here acting on the bits of paper.

01:46.500 --> 01:51.780
So let's have a look now what happens to an insulating material when you place it inside an electric

01:51.780 --> 01:52.800
field.

01:53.490 --> 01:55.590
Zoom in a little bit and see what's going on.

01:55.590 --> 01:59.020
So we're gonna have a negatively charged comb right there.

01:59.100 --> 02:03.710
And now what we're going to do is let's zoom in to one of these pieces of paper.

02:03.740 --> 02:03.980
All right.

02:03.990 --> 02:11.670
So I'm going to kind of really make a large piece of paper right here but this is an exaggeration and

02:11.670 --> 02:12.590
that's OK.

02:12.600 --> 02:20.070
Now imagine this has you know 10 to the twenty six number of atoms in it and each one of those atoms

02:20.100 --> 02:22.400
is basically electrically neutral.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.340
So the paper is initially electrically neutral.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.280
I mean write that down

02:29.010 --> 02:33.840
so why would it be attracted to this negatively charged cone.

02:34.060 --> 02:40.080
OK again if you have something that's electrically neutral we basically have a positive atom and it's

02:40.080 --> 02:44.210
being surrounded basically by a whole bunch of electrons.

02:44.220 --> 02:49.100
All right let me represent those actually with kind of this cloud of electrons okay.

02:49.140 --> 02:56.250
This atom here is negative sorry electrically neutral we have negatives here and we have positive centers

02:57.420 --> 03:01.190
but overall the net charge is the exact same right these cancel out.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.360
So there's no net charge over here.

03:03.510 --> 03:09.660
So what happens now if I place something like this in an electric field produced by these excess negative

03:09.660 --> 03:10.890
charges.

03:10.890 --> 03:15.670
Well let's imagine here what the electric field looks like produced by those charges.

03:15.870 --> 03:19.650
Again the electric field points toward the electrons.

03:19.750 --> 03:20.040
Right.

03:20.070 --> 03:24.780
So we should have electric field lines that are in this direction.

03:24.960 --> 03:27.800
Now we're gonna do is we're going to place some of these neutral atoms.

03:27.810 --> 03:29.490
But what happens now.

03:29.490 --> 03:31.870
Well the positives are kind of stuck there right.

03:31.890 --> 03:34.650
These guys can't really move too much.

03:34.650 --> 03:41.010
So that's just kind of draw a whole bunch of positive atoms will draw the electrons in just a second.

03:42.180 --> 03:42.500
All right.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.300
And let's put the electron cloud now in blue.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.740
Imagine what happens.

03:46.740 --> 03:52.140
The electrons although they're tightly bound so it's not quite like the conductor where they just want

03:52.140 --> 03:53.820
to go in the opposite surface.

03:53.820 --> 03:58.130
What happens over here is these these atoms here kind of get stretched around.

03:58.500 --> 03:58.860
All right.

03:58.890 --> 04:07.980
So the cloud here of electrons will kind of get pushed down by this electric field.

04:08.100 --> 04:14.910
So let me just kind of draw what this looks like in here just to kind of denote kind of some of these

04:14.910 --> 04:19.600
atoms here let's just kind of just draw like an oval around it.

04:19.710 --> 04:20.010
All right.

04:20.010 --> 04:26.550
Anyway you could see now that the positives and negatives are no longer right on top of each other.

04:27.210 --> 04:30.000
These atoms get stretched out.

04:31.050 --> 04:36.240
However if you kind of look at what happens look at the top surface over here what do we have here at

04:36.240 --> 04:41.660
the top surface the top surface of that paper if you look at it closely.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.430
Again the electrons have been pushed down a little bit.

04:44.520 --> 04:52.560
So these top surfaces right here actually become positively charged.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.850
How about the bottom surface down here.

04:54.870 --> 05:02.190
If I take a thin layer down here at the bottom again since the electric field is going up it forces

05:02.190 --> 05:04.920
those electrons down a little bit.

05:04.920 --> 05:09.840
So if I have a look at the bottom surface this here becomes negatively charged.

05:09.980 --> 05:10.840
Let me write that down.

05:10.830 --> 05:13.350
That's also important.

05:13.350 --> 05:15.930
Bottom surface All right.

05:15.930 --> 05:18.280
You could see that in the center of what we get.

05:18.300 --> 05:23.730
If I focus on the center over here again if I kind of combine these negatives and those positives it's

05:23.730 --> 05:26.390
still overall kind of electrically neutral.

05:26.460 --> 05:29.270
I can do that for any layer there.

05:29.280 --> 05:29.580
All right.

05:29.610 --> 05:32.600
So let's draw a simplified picture here on the side.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.570
So this is the electric field produced by the column.

05:35.760 --> 05:41.040
And again what I have are positive top surface.

05:41.040 --> 05:45.210
And I have a negative bottom surface.

05:45.210 --> 05:47.010
Well guess what's going to happen now.

05:47.280 --> 05:47.490
All right.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.120
And again let's just denote this piece of paper here.

05:50.130 --> 05:53.420
Just by something like this.

05:53.880 --> 05:58.380
And the column itself is negatively charged.

05:58.680 --> 06:03.600
If you think about it now in terms of cool Ohm's Law the distance here between the negatives and the

06:03.600 --> 06:04.640
positives.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.300
This is an attractive force

06:10.890 --> 06:11.410
and what else.

06:11.420 --> 06:16.370
There's going to be a repulsive force between these guys right the negatives from the comb with the

06:16.370 --> 06:18.800
negatives from the bottom surface down here.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.780
There is a repulsive force down here

06:23.800 --> 06:30.510
however the net force guess what's going to happen since the proximity here is closer.

06:30.610 --> 06:34.850
It means that the net force on the piece of paper here is going to be up.

06:34.930 --> 06:41.420
This is going to be my net force direction because this force is bigger than the repulsive force.

06:41.440 --> 06:44.740
So that's why the piece pieces of paper get attracted to the comb.
