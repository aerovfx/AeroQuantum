00:00.330 --> 00:00.570
All right.

00:00.570 --> 00:02.770
Let's take a simple example over here.

00:02.900 --> 00:04.530
I split into two parts.

00:04.530 --> 00:11.460
So on the left hand side I have a positive three nano Coolum charge on the right hand side I have a

00:11.460 --> 00:13.670
negative three nano cool on charge.

00:13.740 --> 00:14.460
All right.

00:14.460 --> 00:19.490
And I have a point P that's located one meter away from each charge.

00:19.530 --> 00:24.750
The goal is let's find the electric field at each of these points at point p.

00:24.810 --> 00:25.110
Okay.

00:25.140 --> 00:28.810
So again it's a point charge that is producing that electric field.

00:28.830 --> 00:36.260
So it would be k q over our squared here would be nine times ten to the nine.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.940
That's the K value the charges three nano Q alone.

00:38.940 --> 00:46.170
That's three times 10 to the negative nine and divided by in this case it divided by one.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.310
Well that's one square.

00:47.310 --> 00:48.710
That one's easy.

00:48.810 --> 00:49.050
All right.

00:49.050 --> 00:55.050
So the magnitude of my electric field would be oh 10 to the nine and ten to the negative nine those

00:55.050 --> 00:56.200
things cancel out.

00:56.370 --> 01:01.350
So I'm left with just nine times three which is twenty seven and divided by one.

01:01.410 --> 01:02.400
So that's just that's it.

01:02.430 --> 01:06.480
Twenty seven this is newtons per Coolum.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.020
All right.

01:07.050 --> 01:12.180
Actually if I did the calculation over here again if you had a negative sign for the charge you would

01:12.180 --> 01:15.120
get negative but negative just tells me the direction.

01:15.150 --> 01:15.420
OK.

01:15.450 --> 01:20.130
I already know the direction because I know that this here is a positive charge.

01:20.130 --> 01:25.050
So that means that this here produces an electric field that points away from it.

01:25.050 --> 01:28.570
That is the convention because it's positive charge here.

01:29.010 --> 01:32.700
This vector here would have a magnitude of twenty seven.

01:33.450 --> 01:40.530
If I have a coordinate system where this here is positive y then I might actually just write it as something

01:40.530 --> 01:41.200
like this.

01:41.250 --> 01:41.460
Right.

01:41.460 --> 01:48.130
Positive twenty seven multiplied by the little vector in the y direction.

01:48.290 --> 01:49.330
OK.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.820
How would you do it here for the negative charge.

01:51.890 --> 01:54.560
Again the magnitude is twenty seven.

01:54.710 --> 01:57.710
If you're going to draw a vector though look what we have to do.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.480
You have to draw the vector in the opposite direction.

02:02.000 --> 02:08.270
The vector e points like this and again in this case here it would be twenty seven and it's pointing

02:08.270 --> 02:10.590
in the negative y direction.

02:10.600 --> 02:16.850
So at the end you could write it like this negative twenty seven multiplied by y terms of the direction

02:16.850 --> 02:19.640
you would simply write it like this.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.090
All right.

02:20.090 --> 02:27.890
So now here is a harder question now what happens if I take a charge Q2 and that charge is going to

02:27.890 --> 02:30.690
be negative two columns.

02:31.250 --> 02:36.050
Here's the charge it's a negative and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to place the charge right here

02:37.100 --> 02:39.350
at Point P.

02:40.010 --> 02:40.330
All right.

02:40.350 --> 02:43.420
So I've placed it at point p for each case.

02:43.520 --> 02:49.790
What if I want to know the magnitude of the force in the direction of the force on this negative charge.

02:49.790 --> 02:55.040
Well again if you want to find the force on any charge you simply take the magnitude of the charge and

02:55.040 --> 02:57.640
you multiplied by the electric field.

02:57.980 --> 03:04.870
In this case it would be the magnitude would simply be to add the electric field magnitude is 27.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.800
So this would be 54 Newtons.

03:08.900 --> 03:11.440
Now what would be the direction of the force.

03:11.840 --> 03:18.650
Again if this is a negative charge again remember our vector equation looks like this right the force

03:18.680 --> 03:23.580
on negative charges is always opposite of the electric field at that point.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.710
So this force here would have to be something like this.

03:27.170 --> 03:31.430
And you know right away since this is positive and this is negative you know that the force on the negative

03:31.730 --> 03:34.970
has to be it's an attractive force.

03:34.970 --> 03:35.230
All right.

03:35.240 --> 03:39.010
How about this case again it would be the same magnitude of the force.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.930
So the force F would still be 54 Newtons

03:44.630 --> 03:45.330
the direction.

03:45.330 --> 03:48.260
Now again our electric field is pointing down here.

03:48.330 --> 03:51.190
It's the electric field produced by this negative charge.

03:51.230 --> 03:57.560
That means that the force as a vector is always the charge multiplied by the field.

03:57.680 --> 04:01.580
It's always four negative charges I'm placing a negative charge right here.

04:01.580 --> 04:08.960
It's always going to be opposite of the electric field this here would be the direction of the force

04:08.960 --> 04:09.890
acting on it.

04:09.890 --> 04:14.510
And it's very clear from cool Ohm's Law right we know if we have two negative charges they are going

04:14.510 --> 04:15.730
to repel each other.

04:15.740 --> 04:20.810
So on this charge there is a force like this actually and the other charges the same force just in the

04:20.810 --> 04:22.240
opposite direction.

04:22.250 --> 04:22.460
All right.

04:22.470 --> 04:27.290
But I just wanted to highlight just these two different cases using the same magnitude of the charge

04:27.290 --> 04:30.650
that produces the field just in a different direction.
