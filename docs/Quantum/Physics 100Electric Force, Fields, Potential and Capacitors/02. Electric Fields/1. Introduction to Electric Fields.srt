WEBVTT

00:00.390 --> 00:05.530
All right and now I want to do just a short introduction on the concept of an electric field.

00:05.640 --> 00:11.520
So we saw four cool Ohm's law that if I have two charges let's just take two positive charges just as

00:11.520 --> 00:15.440
an example we can calculate the force between them right.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.280
We can say that there's going to be a force like this.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.850
There's going to be a force like this.

00:20.850 --> 00:25.540
If one of them has a magnitude Q one this one here has a magnitude of a charge.

00:25.540 --> 00:33.420
Q2 that force that we're going to calculate again and call it F the magnitude of the force is simply

00:33.420 --> 00:34.930
our K constant.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.990
Q1 Q2 and divided by the distance squared.

00:39.990 --> 00:43.660
All right let's go ahead and put that on the diagram as well.

00:43.890 --> 00:46.810
Ops not 2 but rather the distance.

00:46.860 --> 00:49.520
Ah okay so that's Coombs law.

00:49.590 --> 00:52.970
So further to be a force we need at least two charges.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.020
So let's write that down as also.

00:55.110 --> 00:59.760
So for this case need a minimum

01:03.900 --> 01:06.540
of two charges.

01:06.540 --> 01:11.490
The question I have for you now is well what happens if there is only one charge.

01:11.490 --> 01:11.930
Right.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.920
You only have one charge in space what happens.

01:15.150 --> 01:18.570
First of all there is no force because there's only one charge.

01:18.580 --> 01:18.840
Right.

01:19.590 --> 01:25.980
What we're going to say now is what I like to do is I like to think about it in terms of like a spider.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.340
Let me just kind of draw us kind of a quick thing.

01:28.350 --> 01:33.760
So the way that the spider kind of works well it will what it will create a web.

01:33.840 --> 01:40.550
This is a really bad looking Web but it might kind of look something like this.

01:41.090 --> 01:43.680
Start looking a little bit better.

01:43.880 --> 01:44.150
All right.

01:44.180 --> 01:46.120
So here we have a web right.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.800
And our spider produced the Web.

01:48.800 --> 01:54.080
And now if we place anything inside that web it will interact with it.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.850
OK so our spider is the thing that's going to produce the web.

01:58.880 --> 02:05.720
So if we have only one charge we're going to say that this one charge is going to modify the space around

02:05.720 --> 02:08.840
it by producing what's called an electric field.

02:09.050 --> 02:16.260
And then if I place any other object inside that electric field that's when I'm going to have a force.

02:16.270 --> 02:16.770
OK.

02:16.910 --> 02:23.080
So let's go ahead and kind of grid of his bad looking Web and let's just think about this for a minute.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.700
So what happens if there is only one charge.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.040
So you write it down

02:31.490 --> 02:37.730
if we only have a one charge.

02:37.730 --> 02:40.460
Okay we're gonna say that it produces

02:46.700 --> 02:47.780
an electric field

02:52.770 --> 02:54.980
and we're gonna call that electric field.

02:55.180 --> 02:56.970
We're going to name it with the letter E.

02:56.970 --> 03:02.110
First of all it's going to be a vector quantity so it's going to be important to do something like this.

03:02.140 --> 03:08.280
Okay so let's start off with just one charge the charge I'm going to consider is just going to be one

03:08.280 --> 03:10.610
of these two charges that I looked at before.

03:10.620 --> 03:17.340
So just the charge q what I'm going to say now is this is going to produce an electric field somehow

03:17.340 --> 03:18.230
in space.

03:18.390 --> 03:23.960
And then when I placed Q2 inside that space it's going to be a force acting on it at the end.

03:23.970 --> 03:27.190
I better have the exact same result is cool Ohm's Law.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.470
So have a look at cool Ohm's law over here.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.840
Let me write it down.

03:31.310 --> 03:37.410
OK Q1 Q2 and divided by R squared.

03:37.740 --> 03:41.550
OK so what happens if there's only Q1.

03:41.550 --> 03:45.110
Well if there's only Q1 let's forget about Q2.

03:45.140 --> 03:45.810
All right.

03:45.810 --> 03:52.650
If there's only Q1 this is all I have is K Q1 over our squared.

03:52.650 --> 03:56.840
This is what we're going to call our electric field.

03:56.970 --> 04:03.590
This is going to be our definition of the electric field for one point charge Q1.

04:03.750 --> 04:09.210
This tells me how big the electric field is that's produced by Q1.

04:09.270 --> 04:11.350
So the K constant is the same.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.560
The charge is Q1.

04:13.590 --> 04:20.600
That's our guy over here in this case it's a positive charge and are well for cool ohms little law are

04:20.670 --> 04:25.730
was the distance between the two charges in this case here are is a little bit different because there

04:25.730 --> 04:27.770
is only a single charge.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.570
So it depends where you want to evaluate this field.

04:30.570 --> 04:37.770
Imagine I wanted to evaluate the field right here at Point P OK the distance R is defined as this distance

04:37.830 --> 04:44.010
is the distance between the center of that charge all the way to the point where I want to evaluate

04:44.010 --> 04:46.770
it this is how you would define R.

04:47.180 --> 04:53.700
So let's go make sure we write this This is the field and again it's just the magnitude field produced

04:57.040 --> 04:58.330
by a point charge

05:03.110 --> 05:08.060
and the point charges Q One got pretty straightforward.

05:08.060 --> 05:11.990
Now I did say something really important I did say that E is a vector

05:15.740 --> 05:20.740
all we have now is the tools to calculate the magnitude of that vector.

05:20.900 --> 05:28.730
So we now have to do is pick a convention and the convention has been determined for us if the charge

05:28.730 --> 05:30.410
q 1 is positive.

05:30.980 --> 05:37.360
We're going to say that the electric field produced by positive charges points away from positive charges.

05:37.410 --> 05:38.660
So imagine there's a line here.

05:38.660 --> 05:44.990
Joining it all the way to point p and the electric field here would point away from this positive charge

05:45.920 --> 05:48.170
if I chose a different point.

05:48.260 --> 05:51.830
For example what about a point P located right here.

05:51.890 --> 05:54.620
It's a little bit closer to the charge.

05:54.650 --> 05:59.070
Well in that case the direction of the electric field produced by that charge would be.

05:59.150 --> 06:03.920
Since it's a positive point charge it would look something like this.

06:03.920 --> 06:09.100
This would be the direction of the electric field right here at this point.

06:09.200 --> 06:15.230
If I go somewhere over here I'm a little bit closer to the charge now that means that this distance

06:15.230 --> 06:19.610
here is smaller right for the red point the distance here would be this one.

06:19.610 --> 06:25.520
This would be the distance are the direction of the field since this is a positive point charge.

06:25.820 --> 06:28.860
The direction of the electric field would be off in this direction.

06:28.940 --> 06:29.160
OK.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.630
It points away all right.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.120
So let's write that down.

06:34.640 --> 06:43.220
So it's a vector and the direction away from positive charges

06:46.410 --> 06:59.560
and that also means that it has to point toward negative charges.

06:59.680 --> 06:59.950
All right.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.060
Two really really important things.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.750
The magnitude is given by.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.520
It's almost cool arms law.

07:05.530 --> 07:09.100
Except I took one of the charges away and the direction.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.440
You just have to look is it positive or is it negative.

07:11.620 --> 07:13.750
That's producing this electric field.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.590
Pretty straightforward.
