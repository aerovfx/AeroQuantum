### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy here's our two point các điện tích here chúng ta có a positive and a negative. What I'm gonna do here is I'm actually going to trace it along over here. Vậy this is going to be a positive x axis. I'll place a positive điện tích over here Đúng here and I'll place a negative điện tích a certain khoảng cách away. Let's try to keep it roughly the same. Again both of these the các điện tích down here you could see there are each one of them is one nano Coolum one positive and one is negative. Vậy let's first look at the area in between and it doesn't matter which point I take. Let's imagine I take a point that is Đúng on the center line over here between the two các điện tích. Vậy let me draw another set of axes. Another axis the y axis and then you place a point Đúng here at the center. OK. Bây giờ I want to do is remember the field produced by each one of those is given by our phương trình because they are both point các điện tích. It's k q over R bình phương. Yeah one thing you should see from this line over here if this is the y axis and this is exactly at the midpoint between the two. I imagine you call this khoảng cách x. You also call this khoảng cách x you could see Đúng away that the khoảng cách between the two các điện tích in this point is going to be the same khoảng cách. I don't know what you want to call it let's call it R and call it r Đúng. And this is the point P where I want to evaluate the field you can see it's going to be the same. OK. Vậy Bây giờ what would you do. Well if I wanted to plot what does the total field look like Đúng here. Again maybe start with the positive point điện tích the positive point điện tích produces an điện trường that looks like this. The độ lớn of that field is going to be k q over our bình phương. Được rồi. How about the field produced by the negative point điện tích the field produced by the negative point điện tích is going to be a véctơ that points toward the negative điện tích and its độ lớn is going to be the same. Được rồi let me just go ahead and I'm got to save some room over here. I'm going to drag it all the way down here k q over our bình phương notice that the độ lớn of each one is the same. Let me write that down. độ lớn is the same. Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ what chúng ta có to do is we really want to find what the total điện trường looks like. Vậy what you have to do is you have to add those up as vectors. Vậy at the end what we're really interested in is the total field as a véctơ. Vậy this here has to be equal to the field number one is a véctơ plus the field produced by the negative điện tích as a véctơ. OK. Call this E two. Được rồi. Vậy how would we add these as véctơ as well again I could just take the first véctơ and then I have to add the second one to it the second one is this guy Đúng here. All you do is you simply take this véctơ and you translate it and Bây giờ the resulting véctơ is going to be this one. This is the total điện trường. At least the hướng the độ lớn we'd have to do a little bit of math in order to find that and I'll do that in just a few minutes. OK. But this is how you would find the hướng Vậy you could go back Bây giờ and look at my diagram here which shows you the hướng the electric feel that every point you could see that at any point here along the center the field is always pointing toward the Đúng. It doesn't matter which point you take because it doesn't matter if I move my point p up above over here. These vectors are always going to have the same length. Được rồi let's try a different point let's try a point like Đúng over here. Vậy over here we're gonna have two electric fields Đúng there is the field produced by the positive one and the field produced by the negative on the field from the positive one points away. Vậy let me go ahead and draw. Let me try to straighten that out. Draw a véctơ over here that looks like this. This would be the véctơ produced by the or the fourth the field produced by this positive điện tích. Được rồi. In the khoảng cách I would use Trong trường hợp này and go ahead and kind of just delete this for Bây giờ. Clean it up. The khoảng cách that I would be interested in here would be this one. This would be the khoảng cách that I would use here for this particular position. Vậy this would be my AR and I'm going to call it our positive because Bây giờ they're not going to be the same because you could see the khoảng cách from the negative điện tích all the way to this point p is pretty far Được rồi. Vậy how would I go ahead Bây giờ and draw the véctơ produced by the negative điện tích at this point. Again I would probably draw like this. And Bây giờ look what I'm doing over here Đúng. This is the véctơ the điện trường véctơ produced by the negative điện tích. What do you see what I did over here. Notice how short that véctơ is and that véctơ is going to be shorter because well think about the khoảng cách we're gonna have Bây giờ the khoảng cách we're going to be using for this particular case is going to be this khoảng cách Đúng here. It's going to go from here all the way to here. This will be the khoảng cách are minus. Vậy again the total field is still the véctơ tổng however. Được. Since the blue véctơ is shorter than the red one the total điện trường at the end should look something like this. You notice it is still a véctơ that points away from the positive. Vậy if I go back to my diagram you could see on this side the véctơ still points away from the positive. But it's going to be small. Được rồi then if you go on the other side ví dụ the other side I could place a point P over here. Here you're going to have the exact opposite. Đúng. chúng ta có the field produced by the negative điện tích which is going to be a larger véctơ because it's closer to the negative điện tích. And then we also have the field produced by the positive điện tích Trong trường hợp này. This is gonna be the shortest one. Vậy I've got the ones in twos mixed up over here. Let me just write it like this and this is the field produced by the positive điện tích. Vậy again when you add both of these vectors up what you end up doing here is you're going to get a total véctơ like this. This is gonna be the total véctơ at least the hướng you can see that from the diagram. When I'm on the Đúng of this negative điện tích I have all the vectors pointing toward it. Bây giờ if you want to take any other hướng you can. You could take this one ví dụ ohm or you could take out of this one ví dụ. Let's take this one since I have less things on my diagram over here. Vậy I want to clean up some some things over here give myself some space. Vậy how would it look like at any general point down here. Well let me take this one ví dụ. Vậy I have a positive điện tích that produces an điện trường that points away from it. Notice I'm pretty close to this positive điện tích Vậy I'm going to draw kind of a long véctơ. And then what else do I have. I have a negative điện tích which produces a véctơ. Bây giờ you've got an imaginary line that joins the negative điện tích to the point. And I'm gonna make that véctơ shorter. Vậy it's going to look something like this. Vậy I and what you have to do is you have to add those up as. Vậy you do e one or the red véctơ plus the blue véctơ. Vậy what I'm going to do is I'm just going to move the blue véctơ down over here because I want to add them up and the total điện trường at this point. Bây giờ if I didn't do it to Đúng should look something like this it's a little bit on an angle over here again I'm just kind of guessing the magnitudes but if I guess wrong you could see I get it Đúng. But over in general it's kind of pointing down and the angle will kind of depend here. Đúng. It kind of depends on how you've drawn those vectors. See if I'm just far enough it's going to point a little bit that side if I'm just closer on this side it points a little bit here. OK. But Trong trường hợp này the way I drew them this would be my total điện trường. OK. We're going to take a numerical example in just a minute. But just getting in a general idea of why you get this field map. You just have to use the superposition adding the vectors the electric fields produced by each điện tích.
