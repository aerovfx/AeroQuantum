# Insulators in Electric Fields

## 02. Electric Fields

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy we just kind of focused on what happens to a conducting material when you place it in an điện trường. Đúng the electrons are going to move in the opposite hướng of the điện trường and you're going to have a lực Bây giờ acting between objects. Vậy what happens Bây giờ what if it's an chất cách điện. What would be the hiệu in the kind of a very easy way of doing this is to take a just the regular comb and brush your hair a few times or what happens is some of the electrons from your hair are going to end up on the comb. Vậy you're gonna have some additional electrons here this comb basically becomes negatively điện tích by picking up some of the các điện tích from your hair as you comb your hair. Bây giờ I imagine you have some kind of pieces of paper. Again we're gonna cut them up in little squares just Vậy they don't have a lot of weight because we want to lift them up. Vậy is this an experiment you could do and anyway what you will notice is that these little bits of paper are going to be attracted to the comb. But why would these little bits of paper which is basically an insulating material. Why would they be attracted to a column like this. Được Vậy other examples of insulators Vậy we could just write this kind of paper is kind of an obvious one glass. What else would. Lots of other materials are insulators and unlike conductors conductors have some of these free electrons that are free to move around. They're not tightly bound to the nucleus Đúng. Vậy they're kind of free when they're placed in điện trường. They move around insulators on the other hand there are electrons are more tightly bound to the atoms Vậy they're not kind of free to move around but you still get this lực here tác dụng lên the bits of paper. Vậy let's have a look Bây giờ what happens to an insulating material when you place it inside an điện trường. Zoom in a little bit and see what's going on. Vậy we're gonna have a negatively charged comb Đúng there. And Bây giờ what we're going to do is let's zoom in to one of these pieces of paper. Được rồi. Vậy I'm going to kind of really make a large piece of paper Đúng here but this is an exaggeration and that's OK. Bây giờ imagine this has you know 10 to the twenty six number of atoms in it and each one of those atoms is basically electrically neutral. Vậy the paper is initially electrically neutral. I mean write that down Vậy why would it be attracted to this negatively charged cone. OK again if you have something that's electrically neutral we basically have a positive atom and it's being surrounded basically by a whole bunch of electrons. Được rồi let me represent those actually with kind of this cloud of electrons Được. This atom here is negative sorry electrically neutral chúng ta có negatives here and chúng ta có positive centers but overall the net điện tích is the exact same Đúng these cancel out. Vậy there's Không net điện tích over here. Vậy what happens Bây giờ if I place something like this in an điện trường produced by these excess negative các điện tích. Well let's imagine here what the điện trường looks like produced by those các điện tích. Again the điện trường points toward the electrons. Đúng. Vậy we should have điện trường lines that are in this hướng. Bây giờ we're gonna do is we're going to place some of these neutral atoms. But what happens Bây giờ. Well the positives are kind of stuck there Đúng. These guys can't really move too much. Vậy that's just kind of draw a whole bunch of positive atoms will draw the electrons in just a second. Được rồi. And let's put the electron cloud Bây giờ in blue. Imagine what happens. The electrons although they're tightly bound Vậy it's not quite like the chất dẫn điện where they just want to go in the opposite mặt. What happens over here is these these atoms here kind of get stretched around. Được rồi. Vậy the cloud here of electrons will kind of get pushed down by this điện trường. Vậy let me just kind of draw what this looks like in here just to kind of denote kind of some of these atoms here let's just kind of just draw like an oval around it. Được rồi. Anyway you could see Bây giờ that the positives and negatives are Không longer Đúng on top of each other. These atoms get stretched out. However if you kind of look at what happens look at the top mặt over here what do chúng ta có here at the top mặt the top mặt of that paper if you look at it closely. Again the electrons have been pushed down a little bit. Vậy these top surfaces Đúng here actually become positively charged. How about the bottom mặt down here. If I take a thin layer down here at the bottom again since the điện trường is going up it các lực those electrons down a little bit. Vậy if I have a look at the bottom mặt this here becomes negatively charged. Let me write that down. That's also important. Bottom mặt Được rồi. You could see that in the center of what we get. If I focus on the center over here again if I kind of combine these negatives and those positives it's still overall kind of electrically neutral. I can do that for any layer there. Được rồi. Vậy let's draw a simplified picture here on the side. Vậy this is the điện trường produced by the column. And again what I have are positive top mặt. And I have a negative bottom mặt. Well guess what's going to happen Bây giờ. Được rồi. And again let's just denote this piece of paper here. Just by something like this. And the column itself is negatively charged. If you think about it Bây giờ in terms of cool Ohm's Law the khoảng cách here between the negatives and the positives. This is an attractive lực and what else. There's going to be a repulsive lực between these guys Đúng the negatives from the comb with the negatives from the bottom mặt down here. There is a repulsive lực down here however the net lực guess what's going to happen since the proximity here is closer. It means that the net lực on the piece of paper here is going to be up. This is going to be my net lực hướng because this lực is bigger than the repulsive lực. Vậy that's why the piece pieces of paper get attracted to the comb.
