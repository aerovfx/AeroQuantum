00:00.180 --> 00:00.420
All right.

00:00.420 --> 00:03.660
So here's our quiz on electric fields here's the first problem.

00:03.690 --> 00:03.900
All right.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.790
We have an electron Opes.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.470
Let's try that one again.

00:07.770 --> 00:08.610
Way too big.

00:08.610 --> 00:08.840
All right.

00:08.850 --> 00:11.800
So we have an electron that's moving to the right.

00:11.850 --> 00:16.920
So that's important it enters a uniform electric field directed upward.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.190
OK.

00:17.190 --> 00:19.110
And that's kind of shown over here.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.020
Which trajectory so we're given different dashed lines.

00:22.020 --> 00:25.770
X Y Z or W will the electron follow.

00:26.040 --> 00:26.340
Okay.

00:26.370 --> 00:27.960
So what do you think's going to happen.

00:27.960 --> 00:32.970
Well first of all electron do we know about electrons right.

00:33.000 --> 00:37.260
They are a negative charge.

00:37.770 --> 00:43.560
So if something's going to follow one of these trajectories you should just look at the forces acting

00:43.560 --> 00:47.660
on the electrons so let's do a free body diagram on the electron.

00:47.790 --> 00:48.610
What is the force.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.690
So the electric field points up.

00:50.880 --> 00:57.510
If you remember the fourth equation force is equal to the charge multiplied by the electric field.

00:57.690 --> 01:02.060
But since our charge here is negative what does that mean.

01:02.070 --> 01:10.050
It means that if the electric field is pointing up it means that our force acting on the electron should

01:10.050 --> 01:11.190
be down.

01:11.200 --> 01:11.530
Okay.

01:11.550 --> 01:13.380
The force is always down.

01:13.380 --> 01:18.810
So imagine now we have an electron kind of going in this direction over here what do you think's going

01:18.810 --> 01:24.750
to happen while as a force acting down so it's probably going to get deflected like this all the other

01:24.750 --> 01:27.340
ones it's not going to continue straight.

01:27.390 --> 01:31.920
So w is not the correct answer because there's a force acting on it and it's not going to be any of

01:31.920 --> 01:38.330
these two choices because again there's a force acting down so the best choice here is trajectory z

01:38.730 --> 01:41.980
so D is really our best choice for this problem.

01:42.030 --> 01:42.320
All right.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.130
Kind of a good problem.

01:43.130 --> 01:44.260
Next one.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.480
Scroll down over here.

01:46.570 --> 01:49.490
What do we have two tiny charged particles.

01:49.560 --> 01:55.390
Oh four sorry four tiny charged particles two of them have positive charge.

01:55.790 --> 01:56.310
OK.

01:56.340 --> 02:01.700
Q And two have negative charges and their place like this in this arrangement.

02:01.740 --> 02:02.020
OK.

02:02.020 --> 02:08.340
Each charges the same distance away from the origin which is right here at the center in which direction

02:08.340 --> 02:12.450
is the net electric field at point P on the y axis.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.190
OK so point p is up here.

02:14.190 --> 02:17.490
So what would be the net direction of the electric field.

02:17.490 --> 02:18.990
Well let's first draw them.

02:19.020 --> 02:19.250
OK.

02:19.260 --> 02:23.850
Actually what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna use some different colors because it's gonna make it

02:23.880 --> 02:25.660
easier to draw the vectors.

02:25.660 --> 02:28.080
OK so let's draw this first charge.

02:28.500 --> 02:33.080
So at point p this guy here I'm going to actually put point P right over here.

02:33.570 --> 02:34.290
So let's have a look.

02:34.290 --> 02:40.260
So this first positive charge the blue one produces an electric field over here that points away from

02:40.260 --> 02:40.790
it.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.930
So I'm gonna call this the field e.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.400
OK.

02:44.730 --> 02:45.210
What else.

02:45.210 --> 02:46.350
Let's choose a different color.

02:46.350 --> 02:52.320
What about the negative one the negative one over here produces an electric field over here point P

02:53.310 --> 02:56.580
and that electric field should point toward negative charges.

02:56.580 --> 03:02.090
However it should be a little bit smaller than this one so it should point like this.

03:02.520 --> 03:02.750
All right.

03:02.760 --> 03:03.600
What's next.

03:03.990 --> 03:06.180
Well now we have to deal with both of those two charges.

03:06.210 --> 03:12.210
So let's deal with this positive charge over here at Point P it produces an electric field that points

03:12.210 --> 03:12.960
away from it.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.170
Right.

03:13.170 --> 03:16.850
You imagine a little line connected it should be a vector that points like that.

03:16.860 --> 03:20.400
So that should be a vector that looks something like this.

03:20.430 --> 03:23.540
That's the field produced by this green charge.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.540
And our last one over here is choose purple it's a negative one.

03:26.660 --> 03:27.320
OK.

03:27.540 --> 03:32.730
The negative one at point p again if you imagine a line that joins the charge to point p.

03:32.910 --> 03:39.180
It should be a vector that points toward that charge because it's negative so that there should look

03:39.180 --> 03:41.230
like this.

03:41.340 --> 03:41.580
OK.

03:41.580 --> 03:44.150
So we have all of these vectors over here.

03:44.160 --> 03:50.330
What do you think's going to happen since they're all the charges have the same magnitude.

03:50.430 --> 03:56.860
You should be able to convince yourself that this one and this one are the exact same magnitude.

03:56.910 --> 03:57.430
Right.

03:57.450 --> 03:59.810
So if you were going to add both of those vectors.

03:59.830 --> 03:59.970
Right.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.580
If all I did was consider both of those I should get a purple and a green.

04:05.610 --> 04:09.930
That sum up to some vector that looks like this.

04:10.700 --> 04:10.940
All right.

04:10.940 --> 04:11.810
What else do we have.

04:11.820 --> 04:16.470
Now we're left with the blue and the red while the blue line is a little bit bigger than that one right.

04:16.560 --> 04:22.560
So at the end really if I add just the blue and the red I should be having an electric field that looks

04:22.560 --> 04:25.080
something like this.

04:25.080 --> 04:25.400
All right.

04:25.430 --> 04:27.770
So let's go ahead now and look at both components.

04:27.770 --> 04:30.720
Let's get rid of this guy and this guy and this is what we're left with.

04:30.720 --> 04:36.300
We have two vectors that are perpendicular and at the end if I would add them up I'll just do it in

04:36.300 --> 04:37.310
pink over here.

04:37.380 --> 04:42.390
I probably should get a total electric field that should point something like this.

04:42.390 --> 04:48.670
OK so it should be upward first of all it's not directly up it's not directly to the left.

04:48.750 --> 04:49.980
It should be upward.

04:50.130 --> 04:51.970
It's not zero that's for sure.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.170
And it should be toward the left hand side.

04:55.230 --> 04:55.430
OK.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.500
So I think C is the best answer for this one.

04:58.500 --> 04:58.730
OK.

04:58.740 --> 05:02.750
So a little bit tricky because you have four different point charges but again where you're going to

05:02.750 --> 05:08.030
use superposition in order to add them all as vectors I think the only thing to remember here is that

05:08.630 --> 05:15.800
this guy here is bigger the blue one is bigger than the red one so that's why it tilt a little bit upward.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.030
All right.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.270
Hopefully you understand that one.

05:17.270 --> 05:19.210
Let's go on to the next problem.

05:19.370 --> 05:20.750
So here's problem three.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.720
What we have are the figure over here.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.730
We have two unequal charges.

05:25.940 --> 05:26.150
OK.

05:26.180 --> 05:32.690
So that's kind of important over here so it's kind of highlight that they're unequal positive Q and

05:32.690 --> 05:39.470
A NEGATIVE Q And they also tell us that negative Q here has a greater magnitude than this one.

05:39.790 --> 05:40.010
OK.

05:40.040 --> 05:44.960
The point X is midway between the charges and now they want to know they've identified different sections

05:44.960 --> 05:49.220
whereas the electric field going to be zero in this configuration.

05:49.220 --> 05:54.290
All right is it going to be zero somewhere along this section or along me somewhere in the middle or

05:54.290 --> 05:55.730
somewhere over here.

05:56.440 --> 05:56.750
OK.

05:56.780 --> 06:01.430
So we have to kind of look at the electric field what I'm going to do here is we're going to try try

06:01.430 --> 06:07.820
drawing the vectors so let's take that one to be red and the other one to be green.

06:07.820 --> 06:10.370
Now let's draw some lines.

06:10.370 --> 06:10.730
OK.

06:10.760 --> 06:16.820
So let's first consider the section anywhere between both of those charges.

06:16.850 --> 06:20.810
So that would be a W x or x y.

06:21.020 --> 06:21.250
Okay.

06:21.260 --> 06:23.280
Both of these it doesn't really matter which one you choose.

06:23.480 --> 06:28.430
If you choose a point anywhere between both of those charges let's draw an arbitrary point here.

06:28.430 --> 06:29.710
Imagine it's right here.

06:29.710 --> 06:30.700
OK.

06:30.830 --> 06:32.690
Imagine you're going to use superposition now.

06:32.720 --> 06:36.920
So what would be the electric field produced by this positive one at this point.

06:37.370 --> 06:40.340
Well it would be a vector that should point like this right.

06:40.340 --> 06:44.030
That would be my electric field from the positive one at this point.

06:44.870 --> 06:49.070
What about the negative one or the negative one would produce an electric feel at this point.

06:49.070 --> 06:54.170
You would also choose an electric field that is going to point in the same direction.

06:54.230 --> 06:54.810
Right.

06:54.830 --> 06:58.620
You see that both of those vectors are in the same direction.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.090
So here that's going to be same.

07:01.130 --> 07:02.630
You make the marker a little bit smaller.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.500
Same direction.

07:05.030 --> 07:10.610
So definitely can't be anywhere between both of these two charges because always you're going to have

07:10.610 --> 07:16.100
this addition these vectors might be bigger or smaller depending on where you choose your point but

07:16.100 --> 07:18.380
they're always going to be in the same direction.

07:18.470 --> 07:25.640
So you definitely can't have W X and you definitely can't have X Y because of this reasoning.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.900
All right let's now look at it doesn't matter which one you choose.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.950
Let's choose this segment over here.

07:31.950 --> 07:32.740
Y Z.

07:32.900 --> 07:36.960
So imagine we choose a arbitrary point anywhere over here.

07:36.990 --> 07:37.320
OK.

07:37.410 --> 07:38.920
And this is our point p.

07:38.960 --> 07:43.410
Let me draw point P down here just to give us a little bit more space.

07:43.490 --> 07:43.700
All right.

07:43.700 --> 07:50.570
Now we have to draw the vectors produced by the electric field produced by both of our point charges.

07:50.600 --> 07:56.390
So we have a positive point charge that produces an electric field over here at Point P and it would

07:56.390 --> 07:58.640
produce a feel that points like this.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.830
This would be the red vector.

08:01.220 --> 08:02.230
How about the green one.

08:02.230 --> 08:06.590
Now the green one now also produces an electric field that point p.

08:06.740 --> 08:09.050
In this case what would we get.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.720
Watch what I do with this vector.

08:10.760 --> 08:19.490
Notice here that I've made this vector bigger right the length of E has to be bigger than the length

08:19.490 --> 08:21.300
of the red one.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.240
So why is that.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.240
Why do you think that is.

08:25.640 --> 08:31.170
So you're always going to have that the green vector is bigger than this one anywhere in this section.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.290
And that's because look at this one.

08:33.470 --> 08:36.860
This charge here is bigger charge greater magnitude.

08:37.460 --> 08:39.530
And you're also closer to it.

08:39.560 --> 08:46.820
Right point p is always going to be closer to this charge than it is to the smaller charge down there.

08:46.820 --> 08:50.300
So that means that this vector here is always bigger than that one.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.680
So you'll never have zero electric field over here.

08:53.720 --> 08:54.020
All right.

08:54.050 --> 08:56.060
How about the other section over here.

08:56.150 --> 09:00.990
Let's draw an arbitrary point over here make it orange and let me draw it down here.

09:01.120 --> 09:05.810
So again now if you draw the electric field due to both of those you're going to have a vector produced

09:05.810 --> 09:10.370
by an electric field produced by this positive charge.

09:10.370 --> 09:11.840
And it points away from it.

09:11.990 --> 09:18.170
And you also have an electric field produced by the negative charge and that one points toward the negative

09:18.170 --> 09:19.580
charge.

09:19.580 --> 09:25.180
Now if you have a look at the distances in this case right the distance over here is small.

09:25.230 --> 09:25.870
Right.

09:25.910 --> 09:32.480
So that vector could be pretty big although the charge is small there's always two things that affect

09:32.480 --> 09:34.910
the electric field right.

09:34.910 --> 09:40.100
It's the charge and also the distance if you make the charge bigger you're gonna have bigger electric

09:40.100 --> 09:40.710
field.

09:40.850 --> 09:45.140
But if you make the distance smaller you can also have a big electric field.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.050
Have a look for this negative charge.

09:48.050 --> 09:53.760
Look at how big the distance is now this should be the distance that I would use to calculate the field

09:54.420 --> 09:58.470
and this distance is much bigger than the first distance.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.630
If this is our one and this is our two.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.760
So that means actually that there could be the case even though you have more charge since you're dividing

10:05.760 --> 10:07.560
by a larger distance over here.

10:07.680 --> 10:11.480
You could get the case where both of those fields are equal to each other.

10:11.550 --> 10:18.150
So at the end really this is not the one we just argued and it really has to be only in this section

10:18.150 --> 10:19.130
over here.

10:19.230 --> 10:23.930
Will there be the possibility that both of those electric fields are going to cancel.

10:23.970 --> 10:28.550
Okay all right let's go to the next one.

10:28.740 --> 10:29.030
All right.

10:29.030 --> 10:34.060
Problem for a problem for here we have three equal positive charges.

10:34.160 --> 10:34.360
All right.

10:34.370 --> 10:35.450
So that's kind of important.

10:35.450 --> 10:42.940
Equal they're all positive Q there at the corners over here of a square in the side is D.

10:43.820 --> 10:49.770
Which one arrow represents the direction of the net electric field at the center of the square.

10:49.940 --> 10:50.180
All right.

10:50.210 --> 10:55.190
So all we really have to do now is just draw all the vectors so let's start with the red one over here

10:56.180 --> 11:01.970
and the red one will produce an electric field at the center which is going to be like this that the

11:01.970 --> 11:05.300
electric field produced by the red point charge over here.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.320
All right how about the blue one.

11:06.320 --> 11:11.000
Let's go the blue here in this corner over here again since it's a positive point charge.

11:11.000 --> 11:16.210
It will produce an electric field at the center of the square here which will be like this.

11:16.430 --> 11:16.630
All right.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.890
So we have both of those vectors so far that we have to add.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.020
We have one more that we need to do.

11:23.300 --> 11:25.950
Let's do this one in the upper corner in green.

11:26.030 --> 11:26.300
Okay.

11:26.330 --> 11:33.410
So that means now that the electric field right here at the center produced by the green charge is going

11:33.410 --> 11:35.480
to point away from it.

11:35.480 --> 11:35.740
All right.

11:35.750 --> 11:42.110
Two of these vectors here are going to cancel out this vector over here and this one they're equal and

11:42.170 --> 11:43.760
opposite to each other.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.530
So those vectors cancel out.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.480
And actually what you're left with at the end is that the total electric field is simply going to be

11:50.480 --> 11:53.970
equal to this because the other two will cancel out.

11:53.990 --> 11:57.680
This is the total E field

12:00.500 --> 12:02.450
OK so that's really choice.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.470
Azar it's kind of buried underneath there.

12:04.570 --> 12:08.760
Choice is really the correct answer for this problem.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.020
All right let's go to our next problem.

12:12.390 --> 12:12.720
All right.

12:12.750 --> 12:20.040
We have a figure over here that shows electric field lines arising from two small charge particles P

12:20.040 --> 12:21.210
and Q All right.

12:21.210 --> 12:23.100
Here they are.

12:23.100 --> 12:30.150
Consider the following two statements the charge P is smaller than the charged Q All right.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.050
Well what do we think.

12:31.050 --> 12:35.650
So let's make say this one here is purple and let's make this one here in red.

12:35.670 --> 12:38.630
So is p smaller than Q.

12:39.210 --> 12:41.010
And how about the second statement.

12:41.010 --> 12:46.890
The electrostatic force P is smaller than the force on Q All right.

12:47.280 --> 12:53.450
Well electrostatic forces one thing we should know is this here is false.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.110
Right.

12:55.170 --> 13:00.330
This here is false because we know that cool Ohm's Law that the force acting on them are going to be

13:00.330 --> 13:01.360
the same.

13:02.100 --> 13:06.030
The other thing we know is that they should be two positive charges right.

13:06.060 --> 13:08.000
There are two positive charges.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.080
And how do I know they are positive charges.

13:11.130 --> 13:19.330
That's because the electric field lines point away from positive charges how do I know about the magnitude

13:19.330 --> 13:23.320
now of each charge which one has more charge.

13:23.320 --> 13:31.310
Well again you would have to argue that Q the charge on Q has to be bigger than the charge on P.

13:31.330 --> 13:36.070
And how do I know that there's simply more field lines right.

13:36.160 --> 13:41.410
More field lines and where you have more field lines.

13:41.410 --> 13:47.470
For example if I choose an area here versus an area here you could see here there is more field lines

13:47.470 --> 13:50.790
crossing that area then close to the charge P.

13:51.250 --> 13:55.250
So that means that this charge has to be bigger in magnitude than this charge.

13:56.020 --> 13:59.020
Okay so this guy is definitely true.

13:59.020 --> 13:59.520
Okay.

13:59.740 --> 14:01.380
So now we just go read the choices.

14:01.420 --> 14:03.540
Only one is true.

14:03.550 --> 14:05.140
Two is not true.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.350
Both of them are neither.

14:06.480 --> 14:06.760
Okay.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.570
Well we know that a is true.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.490
So that's OK.

14:09.490 --> 14:13.060
So for question 5 is the correct answer.

14:13.260 --> 14:13.570
All right.

14:13.570 --> 14:15.070
And our last one over here.

14:15.070 --> 14:23.830
Let's go to a problem six problem six says we have a small Styrofoam ball which has a mass equal to

14:23.830 --> 14:26.590
point 1 2 grams.

14:26.740 --> 14:33.860
It's placed in an electric field of six thousand newtons per Coolum pointing downward.

14:33.890 --> 14:35.850
OK so let's go have a look.

14:35.860 --> 14:42.320
What excess charge must be placed on the ball for it to remain suspended in the field.

14:42.490 --> 14:42.690
All right.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.640
So let's kind of draw what's going on over here.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.260
Let's draw a small ball.

14:48.400 --> 14:53.260
It has a mass equal now going to convert this to go from grams to KG.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.290
Right you need to divide by a thousand.

14:55.300 --> 14:55.600
Right.

14:55.610 --> 14:59.590
So zero point one two times 10 to the negative three.

14:59.590 --> 15:02.260
That is the mass in kilograms.

15:02.350 --> 15:02.670
All right.

15:03.010 --> 15:08.130
Now we place this in electric field which is 6000 pointing down.

15:08.370 --> 15:08.590
OK.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.660
So this is the electric field.

15:11.170 --> 15:15.550
And this is six thousand Newtons Pakula.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.080
All right.

15:17.560 --> 15:22.720
Now let's look at all the forces now acting on this Styrofoam ball.

15:22.720 --> 15:25.490
First of all there is going to be the force of gravity right.

15:25.510 --> 15:29.370
Which is the weight and the weight is m times little G.

15:29.650 --> 15:36.260
The mass we know over here and little g is nine point eight meters per second squared.

15:37.610 --> 15:38.070
OK.

15:38.080 --> 15:43.510
Now if we don't want this or sorry if we wanted to remain suspended in the field we know that the net

15:43.510 --> 15:45.520
force has to be zero.

15:45.550 --> 15:46.210
So guess what.

15:46.210 --> 15:49.050
There better be some other force acting on this ball.

15:49.630 --> 15:53.590
Well we're going to want now is a an electric force.

15:53.590 --> 15:55.480
Call it FC acting up.

15:55.830 --> 15:56.720
OK.

15:57.070 --> 16:03.350
First of all if the electric field is pointing down the charge on here better be negatively charged.

16:03.370 --> 16:04.060
Right.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.770
We want negative charge on here.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.360
So first of all all of these choices here are negative.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.070
So we can't really cancel any of them.

16:12.970 --> 16:14.050
So what do we get now.

16:14.050 --> 16:15.150
Well so what.

16:15.160 --> 16:24.290
All we could do is we find that we want these forces the balance so QE better be equal to M.G..

16:24.430 --> 16:27.090
And again here it's only the magnitude of the charge.

16:27.100 --> 16:30.280
Clearly I know that the force is in the opposite direction.

16:30.760 --> 16:37.520
So the magnitude of the charge at the end is energy divided by the electric field.

16:37.530 --> 16:37.750
OK.

16:37.780 --> 16:44.410
So now we have to substitute everything in so our masses zero point one two times tend to the negative

16:44.410 --> 16:48.370
three kilograms multiplied by nine point eight.

16:48.370 --> 16:53.710
That's the acceleration due to gravity and now divided by the magnitude of the electric field which

16:53.710 --> 16:56.020
is six thousand.

16:56.410 --> 16:59.200
At the end the magnitude of the charge.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.740
Again it has to be negative charge.

17:01.840 --> 17:08.680
So we get here should be minus one ninety six nano Coolum.

17:08.950 --> 17:17.080
Actually you should get times 10 to the negative nine columns and that's negative one ninety six a nano

17:17.190 --> 17:20.500
Coolum if you substituted all our numbers over here.

17:20.560 --> 17:20.800
OK.

17:20.830 --> 17:25.730
So the correct answer actually at the end of the day should be choice e over here.

17:25.730 --> 17:25.980
OK.

17:26.500 --> 17:32.560
So again I'm only looking at the you know that the charge has to be negative because the force has to

17:32.560 --> 17:35.560
be like this over here all our choices are negative.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.260
So it's kind of clear that it has to be negative.

17:38.860 --> 17:43.570
And we really just want to balance the forces because we want it to remain suspended.

17:43.570 --> 17:48.640
So the net force must be equal to zero for this problem.

17:49.330 --> 17:50.030
OK.

17:50.080 --> 17:50.320
All right.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.580
Hopefully you got those ones.
