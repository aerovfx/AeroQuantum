# Electric Field Between Parallel Plates

## 02. Electric Fields

### Tóm tắt nội dung

OK Vậy to illustrate this a little bit Bây giờ what I want to do is I just want to draw a cross section of my plate. Được rồi. Vậy let me go ahead and draw a plate here. I'm going to make it. Give it a little bit of thickness just like this. Vậy again the area goes in and out of the page here over here. And let's assume Bây giờ that I again I it's a chất dẫn điện and I've placed some các điện tích on this plate. And again those các điện tích are going to evenly distribute. They really want to đẩy each other. Vậy what chúng ta có here is some điện tích density which is the total điện tích divided by the area. Được rồi. How would you go ahead Bây giờ and plot this điện trường véctơ everywhere in space here. Vậy on the left hand side and on the Đúng hand side. Well again what I would do is I would just plod vectors Đúng. The véctơ at this point is a véctơ that points away from it everywhere with simply point away from the plate. I would equally space those vectors because the field is uniform everywhere. And the độ lớn of this field again. Here's the phương trình Đúng here. Vậy Trong trường hợp này here would be Sigma divided by two times my hằng số Epsilon 0. That is the độ lớn of the điện trường here. The same everywhere. How about on the left hand side of the plate. Again I would do the same thing again. This is when I'm close to the plate. I can move a little bit farther away from the plate. And this is what the điện trường looks like. Again e is the same độ lớn here. Even if I move farther away. Được rồi. This is what I have to have. The field simply points away from that plate and it's hằng số everywhere. Let me do one more set of vectors over here and then we'll add another plate to this configuration. Được rồi. Vậy far Vậy good. Last thing I want to do Bây giờ. Well let's add another plate. Let's maybe put it over here. I'll draw a similar plate. The question Bây giờ is well what kind of điện tích do I want to place on this plate. Let's play some negative các điện tích. Vậy we add some additional electrons on that plate. Bây giờ what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to put the same number of electrons let's assume those are the same size. Được rồi. Vậy that the điện tích density for this plate over here is going to be well it's going to be a negative total điện tích divided by the same area. Vậy this is negatively điện tích. Vậy what would the điện trường look like produced by the negative plate. How would we how would we plot that. Well let's go ahead and draw vectors again. It's a plate. Vậy the công thức is this. That's the độ lớn. The only hiệu Bây giờ is that the điện trường points toward it. Vậy I would have to add a whole bunch of vectors everywhere in space that are pointing toward this plate. How about on the left hand side. Again I have to add a whole bunch of vectors that are pointing toward it. Or that I draw a whole bunch of them here. Let's just keep on going just on want this is a really really important thing. And then we're going to look at the total điện trường everywhere in space. But for Bây giờ we're going to continue everywhere. When I'm on the left hand side of this plate the blue one over here the negatively charged plate. I have to have vectors that are pointing toward it. Được rồi what chúng ta có Bây giờ are really three regions. chúng ta có region number one which is over on the left hand side of the positive plate. I have region number two which is going to be between both plates. And here I have region number three which is going to be to the Đúng of the negatively charged plate. My goal Bây giờ is really định nghĩa what is the total điện trường everywhere in space. Vậy let me just kind of make myself a little bit of room to do some writing here. Vậy let me just kind of delete these and I can write the total field if you first have a look here what is the total field. Well have a look at these two vectors. What chúng ta có here are two vectors that are in the opposite hướng and they have the exact same độ lớn. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the total field in this region total field here has to be equal to zero. There is Không field anywhere over here because these vectors cancel out let's have a look at Region three region three is something similar is going on here. What I have here are two vectors cancelling out let me go ahead and write that out vectors cancel. Được rồi the electric fields cancel. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the total điện trường in this region has to be equal to zero. Được rồi. And the last one well let's look at what's going on in the center doesn't matter which one you xem xét look at these two vectors Đúng here. There are two vectors that have the exact same length the length of the vectors given by this except Bây giờ they're pointing in the same hướng. Vậy if I plot the total điện trường it should be something like this. This should be e total let's go ahead and write it out. Vậy e total should be the field produced by the red one Được rồi. Plus the field produced by the blue one. While the độ lớn of that field is Sigma over to Epsilon 0. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the total field at the end of the day is 1 while simply Epsilon over zero. Đúng. Vậy between the plates you go ahead and write this down Đúng over here between the plates the fields are additive. The total field the độ lớn. We know the hướng that the hướng has to be pointing away from positive and pointing toward the negative. But the total độ lớn then is simply the điện tích density divided by epsilon 0. Được super super important. And again what chúng ta có here is a hằng số. It's still a hằng số điện trường. It's the same everywhere in space. Vậy really I could draw other vectors over here between the plates the điện trường is uniform. It's the same if it was Đúng here as it is Đúng here. If someone asks you compare the điện trường at this point versus this point versus this point they all have to be the same. They're all the same and they're all equal to the total điện trường between the plates.
