## 02. Electric Fields

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Hi folks. Today I want to solve a problem dealing with electric fields and more specifically I want to tính toán the điện trường produced by a lưỡng cực Vậy for a lưỡng cực chúng ta có a positive điện tích and a negative điện tích and they're separated by some khoảng cách that I've denoted by the letter D. The question is I want to tính toán the điện trường at three specific points in space. The point p is located midway between the two các điện tích the point X is located just above the axis and it's a khoảng cách D over to above point p and the last case I want to tính toán the điện trường that point y a point Y is located on the axis joining the two các điện tích. However it's a little bit closer to the negative điện tích Bây giờ than it is to the positive điện tích. Vậy Bây giờ the only thing to remember for this delay phương trình we really need to tính toán the điện trường for this problem is to remember that the điện trường from any single point charged the độ lớn any is given by this phương trình K is our hằng số Q Is the điện tích and that's the inverse bình phương relationship. Vậy k q over our bình phương. That gives me the độ lớn of the điện trường produced by any specific điện tích. I also have to worry about the hướng of the điện trường Vậy let's go to the online whiteboard and see how we solve that problem. Thanks. Được great. Vậy here's my lưỡng cực. Let's first xem xét the point p. We've got our point p located at the center point between the two các điện tích which are separated by khoảng cách D. Vậy to tính toán the total field at this point chúng ta cần to xem xét the contribution from the positive điện tích and the contribution from the negative điện tích. Vậy let's draw the vectors first. If I'm only considering the positive điện tích let's plot that véctơ and read the field tạo ra at point p by the positive điện tích should point away from the positive điện tích it points away from the positive điện tích. That's the convention and the độ lớn chúng ta có thể tính toán using our phương trình appear. Được rồi Bây giờ let's go ahead and tính toán the field from the negative điện tích in the field from the negative điện tích at the point P where we want to evaluate it. It's going to have a particular độ lớn and it's going to have a hướng because it's a negative điện tích. The field points toward the negative điện tích. Vậy we've got two vectors here that are pointing in the same hướng. One thing you should know Đúng away is since the khoảng cách will be the same for both and the điện tích is the same. Only the độ lớn is different because we're dealing with an electric lưỡng cực. You should notice that the magnitudes of both of those vectors should be the same since the điện tích is the same in the khoảng cách to the to the điện tích to the point of evaluation will also be the same. In both cases the khoảng cách R is simply D ove$r^2$ for this particular point. Vậy therefore the total field is going to be E plus plus a minus Được rồi. We're gonna choose a convention I'm gonna call this hướng here as being my positive hướng. I'm free to choose whatever I want. Therefore if I want to eliminate this véctơ here and we'll call that the positive x hướng. Được Vậy the total feel Bây giờ is simply going to be k kill. And again the distances deal ove$r^2$ bình phương. That is the field from the positive điện tích evaluating that point P plus k q d ove$r^2$ bình phương. We get the exact same thing. Vậy we get two contributions. And again the khoảng cách term is gonna be the same for both. If you simplify that a little bit you're gonna get a one over four here. Once you square everything in at the end of the day you should get eight K Q over over d bình phương in the hướng of the field is going to be in the positive x hướng and I've defined up above. Được rồi. Vậy the total field that point P has a độ lớn of 8 q over d bình phương and the hướng is to the left Được rồi. Vậy case number one is pretty straightforward. OK. Bây giờ let's look at point X point X was located above point p and it was a khoảng cách D over to above. And remember of point P was Đúng at the center. điều đó có nghĩa là at this khoảng cách here from the center line to each individual điện tích is also D ove$r^2$. Được. Vậy if we want to find the field that point X again there's gonna be two contributions to the field each one of them we know the độ lớn. Vậy let's start by drawing the vectors. The field at point X produced by this positive điện tích should point in this hướng away from the positive điện tích. And I'm calling that he plus in the điện trường produced by the negative điện tích at point X is a véctơ of a particular length that I'm going to denote as a minus. And it's pointing toward the negative điện tích. Đúng. If you continue this line here should go Đúng through the negative điện tích. Được. Vậy all chúng ta có to do Bây giờ is simply add those up as vectors. Bây giờ one thing you should note is the vertical components of those vectors are going to cancel out. Again we're dealing with the điện trường from a lưỡng cực Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that this điện tích is equal in độ lớn but opposite sign from the negative điện tích. And also the khoảng cách from the point to each điện tích is going to be the same. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là when you substitute things into our phương trình for the electric fuel produced by one individual điện tích you have the same độ lớn. You also have the same khoảng cách from the point where we evaluate the field to the điện tích. Therefore both of those vectors have the same độ lớn. Vậy when you add them up as vectors at the end let's drive a little bit clear down here at the bottom Vậy we've got a véctơ in this hướng he plus and we've also got a véctơ in this hướng. He minus. Vậy Bây giờ let's find the actual magnitudes of each one of those vectors Vậy chúng ta có thể start with the first one. All we really need to find is what is the khoảng cách from the điện tích to the point of the valuation. Đúng. And that khoảng cách is simply this one over here on the figure. This is r that's very easy to solve because we know the khoảng cách from the điện tích to the midpoint and we know the khoảng cách from the midpoint to the point of observation. Therefore we should be able to solve what is the length of that top side. Each one of these is d ove$r^2$. Therefore R to use Pythagorean theorem. Được. Bây giờ you could simplify this. We're going to get d over a square root of 2 Vậy there's the khoảng cách. Vậy the độ lớn of E plus we do it over here độ lớn of E plus is simply k q and divided by our square r bình phương is gonna be d bình phương divided by two. I'll just put the two up on top here. The độ lớn of E minus is also going to be the same. The only thing that's different is the orientation or the hướng that véctơ. Vậy at the end Bây giờ what chúng ta có to do is we simply have to break both of those vectors down into two components. This year we'll have a horizontal component and a vertical component. Likewise with the green véctơ chúng ta có a horizontal component and a vertical component of the véctơ e minus. And you should see that both of these vectors at least the vertical components cancel Vậy if we choose a coordinate system let's choose a coordinate system where chúng ta có positive why it's pointing up and positive X is pointing to the left. Được. And if you want to find the field in the y hướng let's call the angle that that véctơ makes with respect to the horizontal it's theta. And again you can find theta because it's gonna be the same angle as the angle over here. Since both of those sides are the same you should know that the angle theta should be forty five degrees. Vậy in the y hướng what do chúng ta có. We've got he total in the y hướng is equal to E plus in the y hướng. And Bây giờ the component of E minus in the y hướng is pointing down. I would call that negative and at the end that components very easy. It equals to zero. Well all chúng ta có to do Bây giờ is simply find the véctơ in the x hướng and again both of those are gonna have the exact same length. Vậy the total field in the x hướng is gonna be twice whatever the x component of E pluses and the x component its cos of theta. Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có thể substitute everything we know the two is the fact that chúng ta có both vectors pointing in the same hướng. The độ lớn of E plus I've got a written there on the side it's 2 k divided by D bình phương and coast of theta. That's code of forty five degrees coast of forty five degrees is Route 2 ove$r^2$. You can simplify a few things at the end while we're left with is 2 square root of 2 k divided by D bình phương. That is the total field at point X. Vậy this one's a little bit tricky because the vectors are not along the same axis. However there is some simplification because the y components cancel out and we're left with both components of the X both x components adding together to give us a total field in the x hướng with this độ lớn 2 square root of 2. Multiply times the hằng số I can't forget the điện tích q divided by D bình phương. Được. Được Vậy Bây giờ let's xem xét the total điện trường tạo ra at point Y. Again we're gonna have two contributions chúng ta có a contribution from the positive điện tích at point y. That's a véctơ pointing away from the positive điện tích and we also have an điện trường produced by the negative điện tích at point y. And that véctơ should point toward the negative điện tích. Bây giờ chúng ta có thể easily tính toán the độ lớn of each one. The độ lớn of E plus is K Q And what is the khoảng cách. Bây giờ the khoảng cách is D plus D ove$r^2$. Well that's three D over two and you can't forget the square that guy at the end of the day you expand this power to and what do we get. We're gonna get 4 k q divided by 9 D bình phương. That's the độ lớn of the điện trường produced by the positive điện tích. Bây giờ let's xem xét the negative điện tích k q that terms the same. What is the khoảng cách Bây giờ. The khoảng cách is only D over to a much smaller khoảng cách do you over too. And don't forget to square that term. Vậy at the end of the day when we expand everything chúng ta có thể write out that the điện trường produced by the negative điện tích has a độ lớn of K key over d bình phương. Được. Vậy the total field Bây giờ again I'm going to choose a coordinate system where everything pointing to the left is positive. You're free to do whatever you want at this point. And Bây giờ the total field the độ lớn of the total field is going to be plus four nights Kate Q divided by D bình phương and minus minus because this véctơ here is pointing to the Đúng and I've decided that that hướng is gonna be the negative hướng for k q divided by D bình phương. Được. Vậy you just gotta do a little bit of algebra. Here chúng ta có four nights minus what is this. Thirty six nights and everything is multiplied times the same factor here. Kick you over d bình phương and at the end of the day we are left with that the total feel that point Y is equal to minus thirty two over nine K Q divided by D bình phương. Negative negative for vectors simply tells me the hướng and that tells me that this véctơ here points to the Đúng and that makes sense Đúng. Because the fuel produced by the negative điện tích is going to be bigger at point Y because the khoảng cách to the point Y is much closer for the positive điện tích the khoảng cách is much larger it's three D over two words for the negative điện tích it was only D over two. Được. Vậy at any point in space you simply have to xem xét two vectors the vectors the điện trường produced by each điện tích. Just be careful how you add them up and you should be able to find the điện trường anywhere in space.
