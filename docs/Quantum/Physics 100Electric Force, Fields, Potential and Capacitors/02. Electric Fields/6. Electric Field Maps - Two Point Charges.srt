00:00.300 --> 00:00.560
All right.

00:00.560 --> 00:05.210
I now want to look at what happens if there is more than one point charge in life.

00:05.220 --> 00:08.210
We're going to have situations where there is more than one point charge.

00:08.220 --> 00:12.080
So how would we calculate the electric field somewhere in space.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.270
So here's a nice kind of simple example.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.070
I only have two charges.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.800
They're both one nano Coolum.

00:18.960 --> 00:22.520
The red one is positive and the blue one is negative.

00:22.530 --> 00:23.910
OK so let's have a look.

00:23.910 --> 00:27.250
This is what the electric field looks like in space.

00:27.270 --> 00:32.370
First of all as I'm close to the point charges see how bright the arrows are.

00:32.370 --> 00:36.240
Brightness in these pictures represent the magnitude.

00:36.240 --> 00:41.850
That means that when I'm close to the negative charge or I'm close to the positive charge the electric

00:41.850 --> 00:45.710
field is pretty big and that makes sense because I'm close to the charge.

00:45.990 --> 00:50.330
Let's get rid of that as I go farther away you could see over here you could barely see the arrow.

00:50.370 --> 00:55.310
That means as you go far away the field is getting smaller and that makes sense.

00:55.320 --> 00:55.950
All right.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.590
Now have a look at just all of the different orientations though of these different arrows.

01:01.620 --> 01:01.980
Right.

01:02.340 --> 01:03.540
Let me show you a couple of them.

01:03.570 --> 01:04.910
So let's look at this guy right.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.570
This guy here is pointing.

01:06.570 --> 01:10.610
It's pointing actually directly to the right which is kind of weird.

01:10.650 --> 01:14.680
It's actually the same everywhere here on this line right.

01:14.730 --> 01:18.110
Right at the center between both of those point charges.

01:18.120 --> 01:22.570
Look what I get I get an electric feel that points like this.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.550
It's a little bit strange.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.760
What else as I'm on this side.

01:26.790 --> 01:31.680
Let's use a different color maybe use an orange when I'm to the left of the positive charge.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.330
Look what I get.

01:32.340 --> 01:38.860
I get a feel that points away from it everywhere along here and as I'm anywhere.

01:38.870 --> 01:42.050
To the right of the negative charge.

01:42.060 --> 01:42.720
Look what I get.

01:42.720 --> 01:48.000
I get a vector that is pointing toward the negative charge.

01:48.000 --> 01:48.210
All right.

01:48.210 --> 01:50.310
That's also kind of unique.

01:50.310 --> 01:59.960
So let me just write this down so toward negative here I would be away from positive.

02:00.030 --> 02:04.320
And over here the yellow one would be again toward the negative.

02:04.350 --> 02:08.500
Right toward negative.

02:08.890 --> 02:09.190
All right.

02:09.220 --> 02:13.790
So what we want to do now is we're gonna use something called superposition.

02:13.840 --> 02:19.630
That means that you're gonna be adding vectors from more than one charge adding different electric fields

02:19.870 --> 02:25.060
because different objects are producing electric fields and we're gonna be able to understand this picture

02:25.090 --> 02:26.590
in a lot more detail.

02:26.630 --> 02:31.400
OK so let's look at some of the math behind generating a picture like this.

02:31.420 --> 02:35.770
I'm going to consider points that are again in the three different positions.

02:35.800 --> 02:36.000
OK.

02:36.010 --> 02:40.440
Somewhere over here somewhere in the middle and somewhere on the side.

02:40.630 --> 02:41.180
OK.

02:41.350 --> 02:43.860
So let's consider a kind of different points.

02:43.870 --> 02:45.660
Let's consider them along the axis.

02:45.670 --> 02:48.080
Just to keep the math a little bit easier.

02:48.250 --> 02:53.620
If I start going up here in space then you're gonna have vectors that are in different directions.

02:53.680 --> 02:59.140
And it's straightforward it just takes a little bit more time because you have to add vectors with different

02:59.140 --> 03:00.300
components.

03:00.310 --> 03:06.610
All right let's at least start with understanding what's going on here along this line that joins both

03:06.610 --> 03:07.760
of those charges.

03:07.900 --> 03:11.970
And then later on we'll do other examples where we're going to be further out in space.
