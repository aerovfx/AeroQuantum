### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy here's our quiz on electric fields here's the first problem. Được rồi. chúng ta có an electron Opes. Let's try that one again. Way too big. Được rồi. Vậy chúng ta có an electron that's moving to the Đúng. Vậy that's important it enters a uniform điện trường directed upward. OK. And that's kind of shown over here. Which trajectory Vậy we're given different dashed lines. X Y Z or W will the electron follow. Được. Vậy what do you think's going to happen. Well first of all electron do we know about electrons Đúng. They are a negative điện tích. Vậy if something's going to follow one of these trajectories you should just look at the các lực tác dụng lên the electrons Vậy let's do a free body diagram on the electron. What is the lực. Vậy the điện trường points up. If you remember the fourth phương trình lực is equal to the điện tích multiplied by the điện trường. But since our điện tích here is negative what does that mean. It means that if the điện trường is pointing up it means that our lực tác dụng lên the electron should be down. Được. The lực is always down. Vậy imagine Bây giờ chúng ta có an electron kind of going in this hướng over here what do you think's going to happen while as a lực acting down Vậy it's probably going to get deflected like this all the other ones it's not going to continue straight. Vậy w is not the correct answer because there's a lực tác dụng lên it and it's not going to be any of these two choices because again there's a lực acting down Vậy the best choice here is trajectory z Vậy D is really our best choice for this problem. Được rồi. Kind of a good problem. Next one. Scroll down over here. What do chúng ta có two tiny charged particles. Oh four sorry four tiny charged particles two of them have positive điện tích. OK. Q And two have negative các điện tích and their place like this in this arrangement. OK. Each các điện tích the same khoảng cách away from the origin which is Đúng here at the center in which hướng is the net điện trường at point P on the y axis. OK Vậy point p is up here. Vậy what would be the net hướng of the điện trường. Well let's first draw them. OK. Actually what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna use some different colors because it's gonna make it easier to draw the vectors. OK Vậy let's draw this first điện tích. Vậy at point p this guy here I'm going to actually put point P Đúng over here. Vậy let's have a look. Vậy this first positive điện tích the blue one produces an điện trường over here that points away from it. Vậy I'm gonna call this the field e. OK. What else. Let's choose a different color. What about the negative one the negative one over here produces an điện trường over here point P and that điện trường should point toward negative các điện tích. However it should be a little bit smaller than this one Vậy it should point like this. Được rồi. What's next. Well Bây giờ chúng ta có to deal with both of those two các điện tích. Vậy let's deal with this positive điện tích over here at Point P it produces an điện trường that points away from it. Đúng. You imagine a little line connected it should be a véctơ that points like that. Vậy that should be a véctơ that looks something like this. That's the field produced by this green điện tích. And our last one over here is choose purple it's a negative one. OK. The negative one at point p again if you imagine a line that joins the điện tích to point p. It should be a véctơ that points toward that điện tích because it's negative Vậy that there should look like this. OK. Vậy chúng ta có all of these vectors over here. What do you think's going to happen since they're all the các điện tích have the same độ lớn. You should be able to convince yourself that this one and this one are the exact same độ lớn. Đúng. Vậy if you were going to add both of those vectors. Đúng. If all I did was xem xét both of those I should get a purple and a green. That tổng up to some véctơ that looks like this. Được rồi. What else do chúng ta có. Bây giờ we're left with the blue and the red while the blue line is a little bit bigger than that one Đúng. Vậy at the end really if I add just the blue and the red I should be having an điện trường that looks something like this. Được rồi. Vậy let's go ahead Bây giờ and look at both components. Let's get rid of this guy and this guy and this is what we're left with. chúng ta có two vectors that are perpendicular and at the end if I would add them up I'll just do it in pink over here. I probably should get a total điện trường that should point something like this. OK Vậy it should be upward first of all it's not directly up it's not directly to the left. It should be upward. It's not zero that's for sure. And it should be toward the left hand side. OK. Vậy I think C is the best answer for this one. OK. Vậy a little bit tricky because you have four different point các điện tích but again where you're going to use superposition in order to add them all as vectors I think the only thing to remember here is that this guy here is bigger the blue one is bigger than the red one Vậy that's why it tilt a little bit upward. Được rồi. Hopefully you understand that one. Let's go on to the next problem. Vậy here's problem three. What chúng ta có are the figure over here. chúng ta có two unequal các điện tích. OK. Vậy that's kind of important over here Vậy it's kind of highlight that they're unequal positive Q and A NEGATIVE Q And they also tell us that negative Q here has a greater độ lớn than this one. OK. The point X is midway between the các điện tích and Bây giờ they want to know they've identified different sections whereas the điện trường going to be zero in this configuration. Được rồi is it going to be zero somewhere along this section or along me somewhere in the middle or somewhere over here. OK. Vậy chúng ta có to kind of look at the điện trường what I'm going to do here is we're going to try try drawing the vectors Vậy let's take that one to be red and the other one to be green. Bây giờ let's draw some lines. OK. Vậy let's first xem xét the section anywhere between both of those các điện tích. Vậy that would be a W x or x y. Được. Both of these it doesn't really matter which one you choose. If you choose a point anywhere between both of those các điện tích let's draw an arbitrary point here. Imagine it's Đúng here. OK. Imagine you're going to use superposition Bây giờ. Vậy what would be the điện trường produced by this positive one at this point. Well it would be a véctơ that should point like this Đúng. That would be my điện trường from the positive one at this point. What about the negative one or the negative one would tạo ra an electric feel at this point. You would also choose an điện trường that is going to point in the same hướng. Đúng. You see that both of those vectors are in the same hướng. Vậy here that's going to be same. You make the marker a little bit smaller. Same hướng. Vậy definitely can't be anywhere between both of these two các điện tích because always you're going to have this addition these vectors might be bigger or smaller depending on where you choose your point but they're always going to be in the same hướng. Vậy you definitely can't have W X and you definitely can't have X Y because of this reasoning. Được rồi let's Bây giờ look at it doesn't matter which one you choose. Let's choose this segment over here. Y Z. Vậy imagine we choose a arbitrary point anywhere over here. OK. And this is our point p. Let me draw point P down here just to give us a little bit more space. Được rồi. Bây giờ chúng ta có to draw the vectors produced by the điện trường produced by both of our point các điện tích. Vậy chúng ta có a positive point điện tích that produces an điện trường over here at Point P and it would tạo ra a feel that points like this. This would be the red véctơ. How about the green one. Bây giờ the green one Bây giờ also produces an điện trường that point p. Trong trường hợp này what would we get. Watch what I do with this véctơ. Notice here that I've made this véctơ bigger Đúng the length of E has to be bigger than the length of the red one. Vậy why is that. Why do you think that is. Vậy you're always going to have that the green véctơ is bigger than this one anywhere in this section. And that's because look at this one. This điện tích here is bigger điện tích greater độ lớn. And you're also closer to it. Đúng point p is always going to be closer to this điện tích than it is to the smaller điện tích down there. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that this véctơ here is always bigger than that one. Vậy you'll never have zero điện trường over here. Được rồi. How about the other section over here. Let's draw an arbitrary point over here make it orange and let me draw it down here. Vậy again Bây giờ if you draw the điện trường due to both of those you're going to have a véctơ produced by an điện trường produced by this positive điện tích. And it points away from it. And you also have an điện trường produced by the negative điện tích and that one points toward the negative điện tích. Bây giờ if you have a look at the distances Trong trường hợp này Đúng the khoảng cách over here is small. Đúng. Vậy that véctơ could be pretty big although the điện tích is small there's always two things that affect the điện trường Đúng. It's the điện tích and also the khoảng cách if you make the điện tích bigger you're gonna have bigger điện trường. But if you make the khoảng cách smaller you can also have a big điện trường. Have a look for this negative điện tích. Look at how big the khoảng cách is Bây giờ this should be the khoảng cách that I would use to tính toán the field and this khoảng cách is much bigger than the first khoảng cách. If this is our one and this is our two. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là actually that there could be the case even though you have more điện tích since you're dividing by a larger khoảng cách over here. You could get the case where both of those fields are equal to each other. Vậy at the end really this is not the one we just argued and it really has to be only in this section over here. Will there be the possibility that both of those electric fields are going to cancel. Được Được rồi let's go to the next one. Được rồi. Problem for a problem for here chúng ta có three equal positive các điện tích. Được rồi. Vậy that's kind of important. Equal they're all positive Q there at the corners over here of a square in the side is D. Which one arrow represents the hướng of the net điện trường at the center of the square. Được rồi. Vậy all we really have to do Bây giờ is just draw all the vectors Vậy let's start with the red one over here and the red one will tạo ra an điện trường at the center which is going to be like this that the điện trường produced by the red point điện tích over here. Được rồi how about the blue one. Let's go the blue here in this corner over here again since it's a positive point điện tích. It will tạo ra an điện trường at the center of the square here which will be like this. Được rồi. Vậy chúng ta có both of those vectors Vậy far that chúng ta có to add. chúng ta có one more that chúng ta cần to do. Let's do this one in the upper corner in green. Được. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là Bây giờ that the điện trường Đúng here at the center produced by the green điện tích is going to point away from it. Được rồi. Two of these vectors here are going to cancel out this véctơ over here and this one they're bằng nhau và ngược chiều to each other. Vậy those vectors cancel out. And actually what you're left with at the end is that the total điện trường is simply going to be equal to this because the other two will cancel out. This is the total E field OK Vậy that's really choice. Azar it's kind of buried underneath there. Choice is really the correct answer for this problem. Được rồi let's go to our next problem. Được rồi. chúng ta có a figure over here that shows điện trường lines arising from two small điện tích particles P and Q Được rồi. Here they are. xem xét the following two statements the điện tích P is smaller than the charged Q Được rồi. Well what do we think. Vậy let's make say this one here is purple and let's make this one here in red. Vậy is p smaller than Q. And how about the second statement. The electrostatic lực P is smaller than the lực on Q Được rồi. Well electrostatic các lực one thing we should know is this here is false. Đúng. This here is false because we know that cool Ohm's Law that the lực tác dụng lên them are going to be the same. The other thing we know is that they should be two positive các điện tích Đúng. There are two positive các điện tích. And how do I know they are positive các điện tích. That's because the điện trường lines point away from positive các điện tích how do I know about the độ lớn Bây giờ of each điện tích which one has more điện tích. Well again you would have to argue that Q the điện tích on Q has to be bigger than the điện tích on P. And how do I know that there's simply more field lines Đúng. More field lines and where you have more field lines. ví dụ if I choose an area here versus an area here you could see here there is more field lines crossing that area then close to the điện tích P. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that this điện tích has to be bigger in độ lớn than this điện tích. Được Vậy this guy is definitely true. Được. Vậy Bây giờ we just go read the choices. Only one is true. Two is not true. Both of them are neither. Được. Well we know that a is true. Vậy that's OK. Vậy for question 5 is the correct answer. Được rồi. And our last one over here. Let's go to a problem six problem six says chúng ta có a small Styrofoam ball which has a mass equal to point 1 2 grams. It's placed in an điện trường of six thousand newtons per Coolum pointing downward. OK Vậy let's go have a look. What excess điện tích must be placed on the ball for it to remain suspended in the field. Được rồi. Vậy let's kind of draw what's going on over here. Let's draw a small ball. It has a mass equal Bây giờ going to convert this to go from grams to KG. Đúng you need to divide by a thousand. Đúng. Vậy zero point one two times 10 to the negative three. That is the mass in kilograms. Được rồi. Bây giờ we place this in điện trường which is 6000 pointing down. OK. Vậy this is the điện trường. And this is six thousand Newtons Pakula. Được rồi. Bây giờ let's look at all the các lực Bây giờ tác dụng lên this Styrofoam ball. First of all there is going to be the lực of gravity Đúng. Which is the weight and the weight is m times little G. The mass we know over here and little g is nine point eight meters per second bình phương. OK. Bây giờ if we don't want this or sorry if we wanted to remain suspended in the field we know that the net lực has to be zero. Vậy guess what. There better be some other lực tác dụng lên this ball. Well we're going to want Bây giờ is a an lực điện. Call it FC acting up. OK. First of all if the điện trường is pointing down the điện tích on here better be negatively charged. Đúng. We want negative điện tích on here. Vậy first of all all of these choices here are negative. Vậy chúng ta có thể't really cancel any of them. Vậy what do we get Bây giờ. Well Vậy what. All we could do is we find that we want these các lực the balance Vậy QE better be equal to M.G.. And again here it's only the độ lớn of the điện tích. Clearly I know that the lực is in the opposite hướng. Vậy the độ lớn of the điện tích at the end is energy divided by the điện trường. OK. Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có to substitute everything in Vậy our masses zero point one two times tend to the negative three kilograms multiplied by nine point eight. That's the gia tốc due to gravity and Bây giờ divided by the độ lớn of the điện trường which is six thousand. At the end the độ lớn of the điện tích. Again it has to be negative điện tích. Vậy we get here should be minus one ninety six nano Coolum. Actually you should get times 10 to the negative nine columns and that's negative one ninety six a nano Coolum if you substituted all our numbers over here. OK. Vậy the correct answer actually at the end of the day should be choice e over here. OK. Vậy again I'm only looking at the you know that the điện tích has to be negative because the lực has to be like this over here all our choices are negative. Vậy it's kind of clear that it has to be negative. And we really just want to balance the các lực because we want it to remain suspended. Vậy the net lực must be equal to zero for this problem. OK. Được rồi. Hopefully you got those ones.
