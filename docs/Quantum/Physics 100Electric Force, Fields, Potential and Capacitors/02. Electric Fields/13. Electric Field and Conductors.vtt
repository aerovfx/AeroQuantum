00:00.260 --> 00:02.580
All right now I want to look at conductors.

00:02.580 --> 00:02.940
All right.

00:02.940 --> 00:07.710
Conductors and it could be any shape here I have a piece of copper pipe.

00:07.710 --> 00:10.900
This is a conductor now what happens if I charge it.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.800
What is the electric field inside.

00:12.930 --> 00:19.260
The conductor and the other thing I could ask is what happens if I place a conductor inside an electric

00:19.260 --> 00:20.620
field.

00:20.620 --> 00:26.040
OK if AJ and I place this copper pipe inside parallel plates that are charged and produce a uniform

00:26.040 --> 00:26.940
electric field.

00:27.030 --> 00:28.050
What would happen.

00:28.050 --> 00:28.260
OK.

00:28.290 --> 00:32.760
So there's a couple of properties of conductors and electric fields that are important to review here

00:32.760 --> 00:33.920
and try to understand.

00:33.930 --> 00:34.150
All right.

00:34.170 --> 00:35.450
So let's get started.

00:35.460 --> 00:35.700
All right.

00:35.730 --> 00:38.070
So let's start with just the conductor.

00:38.070 --> 00:42.790
I'm gonna make it any arbitrary shape it really doesn't matter all right.

00:42.810 --> 00:49.380
Just write it down that this is a conductor could be a piece of copper aluminum something where the

00:49.380 --> 00:50.990
electrons are free to move.

00:51.010 --> 00:51.170
Right.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.120
That's kind of our definition.

00:53.160 --> 00:55.020
So this is a conductor.

00:55.170 --> 01:00.050
Now one important property of conductors let's write it over here.

01:00.270 --> 01:01.740
The field inside

01:05.010 --> 01:08.970
the electric field inside has to be equal to zero.

01:09.010 --> 01:14.700
Okay this is super important if there's anything you remember about conductors it's this the field inside

01:14.700 --> 01:16.600
has to be zero.

01:16.650 --> 01:19.450
Think about it if it's the opposite of this right.

01:19.470 --> 01:22.600
What happens if there is an electric field inside.

01:22.620 --> 01:27.840
Imagine here we have an electric field inside the conductor which points like this well that automatically

01:27.840 --> 01:32.910
means that if I have an electron over here it's going to have a force acting on it.

01:32.970 --> 01:33.480
Okay.

01:33.540 --> 01:37.550
And if there is a force acting on the charge it means these charges would move.

01:37.780 --> 01:38.350
Okay.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.780
And that's really not what's happening.

01:39.780 --> 01:43.860
Because if you have moving charges that is actually an electric current.

01:43.920 --> 01:49.680
And if you just have a piece of metal a conductor just sitting there there are no charges that are moving.

01:49.740 --> 01:50.400
All right.

01:50.400 --> 01:57.420
So that is kind of the key thing right at the beginning is that the electric field inside must be zero.

01:57.440 --> 01:57.720
OK.

01:57.750 --> 01:59.040
And this is always

02:02.150 --> 02:04.570
we're going to see later on if you look at electric circuits.

02:04.580 --> 02:08.200
Now that's a different case you might have a piece of copper connected to a battery.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.670
All right in that case the charges will move.

02:10.700 --> 02:16.100
But if we just have a static conductor a piece of metal just sitting somewhere the fuel must be inside.

02:16.910 --> 02:20.060
All right what happens then if I add charge to the surface.

02:20.100 --> 02:20.830
Right.

02:20.900 --> 02:25.870
What happens if I do some if I rub it against something or if I use some induction.

02:26.000 --> 02:26.650
What happens.

02:26.650 --> 02:32.960
The charge imagine I add electrons to this conductor what happens to those charges.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.230
Well now there can't be an electron anywhere inside here.

02:36.260 --> 02:36.440
Right.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.570
This wouldn't make sense because these two charges would produce electric fields.

02:40.580 --> 02:44.010
And we said we can't have an electric field inside the conductor.

02:44.390 --> 02:51.170
So actually what happens if you add charges they actually all end up right at the surface of the conductor.

02:51.170 --> 02:55.100
So let's add a whole bunch of negative charges to this conductor

02:59.400 --> 03:00.790
if you charge it.

03:01.530 --> 03:12.580
If we add charge to a neutral conductor all of those charges will be at the surface they're gonna end

03:12.580 --> 03:14.530
up at the surface.

03:14.560 --> 03:19.890
Now the other thing you might ask yourself well how are those charges going to spread out on the surface.

03:20.590 --> 03:21.080
OK.

03:21.130 --> 03:23.160
Charges will always spread out.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.010
Let me write it down.

03:24.010 --> 03:26.680
Charges will spread out

03:31.480 --> 03:35.670
in such a way that the E inside is always zero.

03:36.910 --> 03:42.940
So the charges are going to find a way to spread out not always evenly especially if you have some sharp

03:42.940 --> 03:44.220
corners like this.

03:44.220 --> 03:44.750
Right.

03:44.830 --> 03:51.170
But they're going to find a way to spread out so that the total electric field inside must be zero.

03:51.190 --> 03:59.800
One thing we you can typically find is that along the straight sections the charge density of this conductor

04:00.160 --> 04:02.730
over here is tends to be small.

04:03.250 --> 04:08.840
This here charge density that's the charge per unit area tends to be small.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.940
If there's one more bending.

04:11.980 --> 04:12.870
OK sharper.

04:12.930 --> 04:21.670
Kind of turns to this conductor you tend to have a larger charge density smaller charge density along

04:21.700 --> 04:23.350
kind of straight surfaces.

04:23.350 --> 04:28.990
Probably more charges along the corners and you need that in order to get the total field inside to

04:28.990 --> 04:31.020
be equal to zero.

04:31.030 --> 04:39.200
So here's kind of a sharp sharp turn in the conductor probably more charge along this surface.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.370
So imagine.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.520
So I've added charge.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.410
So there is a total charge here to this piece of metal.

04:44.430 --> 04:48.420
The question is well if e is zero inside.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.100
What about the outside electric field.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.880
So outside.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.500
Well you could look at a point that's very very close to it.

04:57.590 --> 04:58.090
Right.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.030
If you were going to look at a point that's close to this.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.870
The other property of electric fields close.

05:03.890 --> 05:11.130
The conductors if they're charged the electric field is always perpendicular to the surface.

05:11.730 --> 05:13.710
He is perpendicular to surface

05:16.810 --> 05:17.890
super important.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.780
So let me also write it down over here.

05:23.410 --> 05:27.170
He is perpendicular to the surface.

05:27.310 --> 05:32.390
There is no component of the electric field that is parallel to the surface right.

05:32.410 --> 05:37.420
I imagine you had a parallel component to the electric field at the surface and we just said that's

05:37.420 --> 05:38.840
where the charges are.

05:38.890 --> 05:44.680
If there is a component like this it means there would be a force acting on the charge which would tend

05:44.680 --> 05:46.870
to move the charge along the surface.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.770
And that's really not what is happening.

05:49.770 --> 05:55.930
Those charges are in equilibrium and you're gonna have that only if the electric field is perpendicular

05:55.930 --> 05:58.790
to the surface like this.

05:59.020 --> 06:06.070
If you remembered our parallel plate we said that the field was for parallel plates e parallel was equal

06:06.070 --> 06:08.380
to Sigma divided by epsilon 0.

06:08.380 --> 06:09.820
This was between the plates

06:15.710 --> 06:16.850
for a conductor.

06:16.850 --> 06:20.350
Again the charge density is not the same everywhere.

06:20.360 --> 06:20.570
Right.

06:20.570 --> 06:25.270
It could be bigger in some sections it could be smaller and straighter segments.

06:25.580 --> 06:30.980
If you actually wanted to measure the charge density one way to do it is to measure the electric field

06:30.980 --> 06:37.040
we said it's perpendicular and actually this electric field is still it's actually the same as parallel

06:37.040 --> 06:37.430
plates.

06:37.430 --> 06:42.690
It turns out to prove this you can use Gauss as law which we could do later on.

06:42.920 --> 06:48.400
You could also use some calculus which is a little bit more complicated depending on the situation.

06:48.560 --> 06:53.870
But what this does here is if there is a certain charge density right here and I measure the field close

06:53.870 --> 06:59.100
to it then on the electric field is actually proportional to the charge density right here.

06:59.180 --> 07:01.930
Now the charge density is not the same everywhere.

07:01.940 --> 07:05.640
So for example right here the electric field is a little bit bigger.

07:05.660 --> 07:09.710
I have it actually in the wrong direction right here since this is negatively charged.

07:09.710 --> 07:11.120
Well I'm sorry about that.

07:11.330 --> 07:17.690
Right the electric field should point like this and the magnitude of this field should look like Epsilon

07:17.690 --> 07:24.920
0 and the EPS the signal over here is the charge density very close to the point where I'm observing

07:24.920 --> 07:32.090
the field now the field produced by this is not uniform but if you go close to the surface again it

07:32.090 --> 07:39.540
should be close to constant and it should be perpendicular to the surface.

07:41.270 --> 07:43.460
All right so let's start with a conductor here.

07:43.460 --> 07:46.710
I'm going to assume that the total charge on the conductor is neutral.

07:46.750 --> 07:47.840
OK so there's nothing on it.

07:48.300 --> 07:53.920
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to place that conductor inside parallel plates.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.160
All right.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.610
There it is right over here.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.140
You're going to place it right in the middle.

07:58.370 --> 08:02.040
Now my parallel plates here have charges on them.

08:02.190 --> 08:05.300
So here's the one on the left here is positively charged.

08:05.300 --> 08:10.280
The one on the right you could see has some negative charge on it and these parallel plates produce

08:10.310 --> 08:12.610
a an electric field right.

08:12.650 --> 08:15.440
This is the field produced by the parallel plates.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.110
They point away from the positive and toward the negative.

08:18.890 --> 08:26.660
So what happens now when I place this neutral conductor inside the parallel plates like this.

08:26.920 --> 08:28.310
Let's go place inside

08:31.100 --> 08:32.790
place inside an electric field.

08:32.830 --> 08:33.150
Right.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.050
That's what we're doing.

08:35.590 --> 08:35.840
All right.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.920
What's going to happen.

08:37.160 --> 08:43.170
Well again we require that the total field inside the conductor has to be zero.

08:43.280 --> 08:47.100
But how can that be if it's placed inside an electric field.

08:47.120 --> 08:55.460
We must have e total on the inside equals to zero but if you zoom in over here let me zoom in to this

08:55.460 --> 08:57.500
conductor.

08:57.500 --> 09:03.110
If I place it inside an electric field produced by the parallel plates you definitely have a field like

09:03.110 --> 09:03.320
this.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.410
This is the field produced by the parallel plates.

09:06.410 --> 09:14.750
But if e has to be zero inside it means there has to be some electric field that has to cancel the one

09:14.750 --> 09:16.210
from the parallel plates.

09:17.280 --> 09:17.430
Right.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.960
This is from parallel plates

09:23.050 --> 09:28.180
and this is the electric field produced by the conductor to cancel it out because at the end you need

09:28.180 --> 09:29.260
zero inside.

09:29.890 --> 09:33.070
So this is kind of induced.

09:33.300 --> 09:39.270
So what happens you take a neutral conductor and in order to cancel out the field what you're going

09:39.270 --> 09:44.460
to end up doing is you're going to end up getting negative charges on one side of the conductor and

09:44.460 --> 09:47.750
that's going to leave the other side positive.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.940
So let's have a look at that right.

09:49.980 --> 09:59.490
If I have some negative charges over here and that leaves the other side positive at the end these charges

09:59.490 --> 10:05.680
on the surface they produce this electric field that's going to cancel the other one so when you add

10:05.680 --> 10:13.290
them all up as vectors you get that inside must be equal to zero.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.600
The other property that you could see from here.

10:15.610 --> 10:18.010
Let me just clean up this figure a little bit.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.190
Is that now on the outside.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.240
You notice that the electric field lines.

10:22.240 --> 10:26.190
Now again they have to start from positive and they have to end at the negative.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.320
But we have some negatives over here.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.050
You can see that the electric field gets kind of altered.

10:32.050 --> 10:36.070
That's because it's not only the field produced by parallel plates anymore.

10:36.070 --> 10:43.360
It's also the field produced by the charges on this surface of the conductor.

10:43.720 --> 10:50.380
At the end what we're always going to find is that the electric field when it again it has the end that

10:50.380 --> 10:56.250
these negative charges right here it actually always has to be perpendicular to the surface.

10:56.440 --> 11:01.150
If it's not perpendicular to the surface again that's the same argument I made previously.

11:01.150 --> 11:05.920
If you have an electric field that's parallel to the surface that's not going to work because that's

11:05.920 --> 11:09.610
going to produce a force on the charges.

11:09.610 --> 11:11.690
So you can't have anything like this.

11:13.930 --> 11:18.310
So at the end the total field looks much much more complicated than was before but a couple of the same

11:18.310 --> 11:22.480
properties exists the electric field inside any conductor is zero.

11:22.780 --> 11:28.540
And the field lines they always end up being perpendicular here to the surface doesn't matter on which

11:28.540 --> 11:33.280
surface you're looking at even if you have something more complicated.

11:33.440 --> 11:40.130
One thing that's kind of cool is if you take a conductor instead of it being a solid over here even

11:40.130 --> 11:42.640
if you're a conductor has a hole inside right.

11:42.650 --> 11:43.840
Imagine there was a hole inside.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.590
We call this a cavity inside the conductor.

11:46.790 --> 11:53.450
One of the properties here is that the electric field inside that cavity is also going to be zero.

11:53.480 --> 11:59.920
So actually what you can do is you can put anything inside this cavity here and there's not going to

11:59.920 --> 12:01.810
be an electric field inside.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.310
So a lot of times we do something called shielding.

12:05.380 --> 12:14.630
Sometimes people put like a human inside a shield or inside like a metal fence and a metal fence is

12:14.630 --> 12:16.430
basically a conductor.

12:16.590 --> 12:16.850
Right.

12:18.350 --> 12:24.320
And you can be protected from a large electric field on the outside because on the inside of the conductor

12:25.010 --> 12:27.720
the electric field should be zero.

12:27.800 --> 12:33.490
So they call this shielding the inside is zero.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.660
Approximately zero.

12:34.660 --> 12:37.490
This is not a if it's a fence it has a lot of holes in it.

12:37.510 --> 12:38.670
Right.

12:38.860 --> 12:45.670
But nonetheless it's still kind of like a conductor and you get a prize you get a very small electric

12:45.670 --> 12:47.290
field on the inside of the cavity.
