00:00.210 --> 00:04.620
Let's do a kind of a quick calculation here so again we have our electric field that's produced by a

00:04.620 --> 00:11.340
point charge Q1 in this case Q1 is going to be two micro columns and I'm going to place the point where

00:11.340 --> 00:13.590
I want to evaluate the electric field right here.

00:13.590 --> 00:15.840
It's five meters away.

00:15.840 --> 00:22.950
One thing I know automatically is that since this here is a positive point charge the convention is

00:22.950 --> 00:27.190
that the electric field should point away from this positive point charge.

00:27.210 --> 00:32.140
So right here my electric field vector should look like this.

00:32.280 --> 00:36.770
Now define how big it is I have to substitute my values right here.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.760
So I need to use the k constant.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.090
That's the same as before same as cool Ohm's Law.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.830
TEN TIMES 10 TO THE 9.

00:43.880 --> 00:44.230
All right.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.850
What is the charge that's producing the electric field.

00:46.970 --> 00:49.000
What's right here is to micro cool.

00:49.190 --> 00:53.570
So it's two times 10 to the negative 6.

00:53.690 --> 00:59.390
And now I have to divide by our squared are in this case is the distance from the point charge to the

00:59.390 --> 01:01.550
point where I'm evaluating the field.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.130
This is five squared and that again is just the magnitude.

01:05.670 --> 01:06.080
OK.

01:06.110 --> 01:09.920
So if I plug everything in my calculator let me go ahead and do that.

01:09.920 --> 01:17.510
Just bear with me nine of the nine times to either the negative six and divided by five squared I could

01:17.510 --> 01:19.930
do that in my head divided by 25.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.100
All right at the end of the day I get a an electric field that is seven hundred and twenty.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.180
That's the magnitude.

01:26.530 --> 01:26.890
OK.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.940
So what are the units.

01:28.940 --> 01:33.650
Well it's kind of almost like cool homes law that was measured in Newtons.

01:33.740 --> 01:39.470
However we've removed one of the charges so the units for electric field should be Newton's Pakula.

01:39.710 --> 01:39.960
OK.

01:39.980 --> 01:42.740
So that's kind of a really really important.

01:43.190 --> 01:43.460
All right.

01:43.490 --> 01:49.850
So the units use square brackets to denote the units they should be in units of Newton's divided by

01:49.850 --> 01:51.660
columns.

01:51.710 --> 01:51.920
All right.

01:51.920 --> 01:56.540
So if I go over here I should write newtons per column and here's the direction.

01:56.690 --> 01:57.080
All right.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.130
So now I have a follow up question here.

02:00.200 --> 02:06.200
What happens now if I take a charge Q2 and place it

02:09.550 --> 02:13.120
at point p.

02:13.440 --> 02:13.710
All right.

02:13.710 --> 02:20.700
And for now I'm going to assume that Q2 is going to be equal to six micro Coolum.

02:21.530 --> 02:21.840
Okay.

02:22.470 --> 02:27.370
So let's go ahead and take my charge Q2 and we're going to place it at point p.

02:27.420 --> 02:36.080
So this is what I'm gonna do here is Q2 now it has more charge it has three times more charge than Q1.

02:36.510 --> 02:44.940
What if I wanted to find the force produced by Q1 on Q2 How can I do that how do I find the force.

02:44.970 --> 02:48.350
Well one thing I could do right away is just the right down cool Ohm's Law.

02:48.360 --> 02:55.980
Right cool Ohm's Law would just say that the forces K Q1 Q2 divided by our squared and I could substitute

02:55.980 --> 02:57.760
in all the values for that.

02:58.510 --> 03:01.540
However we've already done most of the work.

03:01.620 --> 03:02.860
Look at this guy right here.

03:02.910 --> 03:05.730
Woop K. Q1 over our squared.

03:05.790 --> 03:06.420
What is this.

03:06.420 --> 03:12.650
This is nothing more than the electric field so this is where you're going to start seeing the real

03:12.650 --> 03:15.760
advantage of knowing the electric field.

03:15.810 --> 03:16.100
Okay.

03:16.220 --> 03:23.360
If I wanted to find the force in going back to this equation here it would simply be Q2 multiplied by

03:23.360 --> 03:26.010
this guy multiplied by the electric field.

03:26.300 --> 03:33.820
And this is the electric field produced by the first charge by q 1 so right away you're able to write

03:33.820 --> 03:39.760
down this expression that the force on any charge that I place here is going to be the value of that

03:39.760 --> 03:46.340
charge multiplied by the electric field produced at this particular point.

03:46.550 --> 03:54.690
So for this question here would simply be Q2 6 micro cooling multiplied by the electric field.

03:54.750 --> 03:58.210
It's really the electric field produced by the first charge.

03:58.280 --> 04:05.390
This would give me the force on Q2 so we go ahead and we substitute in our values right here.

04:05.470 --> 04:17.140
So the force on Q2 it's the magnitude of the charge Q2 and that's six times 10 to the negative 6 and

04:17.140 --> 04:20.320
multiplied by the electric field right here at this point.

04:20.410 --> 04:24.400
That's where that charge is located multiplied by 720.

04:25.180 --> 04:25.900
OK.

04:25.930 --> 04:31.780
Now I can go ahead and just multiply this out with my calculator six either the negative six times 720

04:32.350 --> 04:40.480
at the end guess gives me four point three two times 10 to the negative three and that should be measured

04:40.480 --> 04:41.470
in Newtons.

04:42.640 --> 04:48.290
Okay so this would be the fourth here acting on my charge Q2.

04:48.310 --> 04:48.640
All right.

04:48.670 --> 04:51.820
So let's go recap all of this in the next video.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.610
I just wanted to show you just the simple example.

04:54.760 --> 05:01.510
The nice thing about this is if I change Q2 if instead if I have a different charge what if instead

05:01.510 --> 05:09.490
I have a charge Q3 that's equal to 25 merely Coolum and I place it right here instead of Q2 I place

05:09.490 --> 05:16.260
a charge Q3 right here or right away I'm able to calculate the force on Q3.

05:16.710 --> 05:17.040
Right.

05:17.110 --> 05:24.430
Because the force on Q3 again I'm just going to use this expression right here since I know the electric

05:24.430 --> 05:25.750
field right here.

05:25.930 --> 05:33.490
The force on Q3 is simply going to be Q3 multiplied by my electric field at that point which is simply

05:33.520 --> 05:38.470
e k so it's very very easy to calculate that.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.450
All right we'll summarize everything on the next video.
