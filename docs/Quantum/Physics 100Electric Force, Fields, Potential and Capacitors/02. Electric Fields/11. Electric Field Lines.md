# Electric Field Lines

## 02. Electric Fields

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi we focused quite a bit on drawing the vectors for electric fields produced by various objects ví dụ positive point điện tích here. Case number one this is my point. I COULD SAY THIS IS THE điện trường produced by this one. If it's a lưỡng cực I choose the point Đúng over here I could say yeah the điện trường points like this away from the positive toward the negative and we just saw that for the parallel plate for the parallel plate. If I draw the điện trường véctơ anywhere ví dụ Đúng here at this point it would point away from the positive toward the negative. Bây giờ if you start doing this at all different points around the objects you know it can kind of take a long time because you really have to go everywhere in space and start drawing the véctơ Đúng as you kind of start going away from the point điện tích you'd have to make the véctơ a little bit smaller. Đúng. Always pointing away from it. Được rồi if I go all the way over here again pointing away from it it would be something like this. Vậy typically what people do is they don't really plot the vectors everywhere. What we do instead is we plot điện trường lines and this is kind of what they look like. Again you can imagine having all these vectors here kind of spaced out and what we're gonna do is we're simply going to loops. Let's let's use the marker instead what we're gonna do here is we're going to simply tạo ra lines or connect these vectors by lines. OK. The lines are continuous. Vậy they would kind of look like this or imagine all of these vectors here pointing along this orange line. And this is going to be a different representation of the same điện trường Vậy we call these điện trường lines. Vậy for a point điện tích they would look like this. Bây giờ chúng ta có to give a hướng to them. Vậy the hướng that we're going to pick again it's going to be the same thing. First of all they're going to point away from positive point các điện tích. OK. Vậy that's the hướng. Vậy that's kind of easy to remember it's the same as the vectors and these are called điện trường lines. Notice they are just continuous lines. OK. There's Không kind of break here between them. The other thing that we notice about them is the điện trường lines they never cross. They're kind of all independent lines. The other thing we wanted to know is well if chúng ta có a véctơ for điện trường not only do we know the hướng but we also know kind of how big it is just from the length. How about điện trường lines. And if you're given a picture of điện trường lines how do you know where the field is the biggest hit. Well all you have to do then is xem xét like a play a point or an area that's close to this điện tích. Đúng. If you xem xét over here Đúng over here you could see I have two field lines that cross this area whereas over here in space if I draw kind of the same area you see I only have one over here. Vậy then when you have a large number of field lines that cross an area that tells you where the field is the biggest. OK. Vậy you have to look at it Vậy close the các điện tích you're going to have a lot of field lines that are closely spaced when you get far away. You see the field lines here are farther apart. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the điện trường is smaller OK an điện trường over here is bigger because the field lines are close together. Let's have a look at the lưỡng cực field lines. I want to go ahead and draw them. I'm going to move it over a little bit just Vậy chúng ta có thể have a bit more space and let's draw what the điện trường lines look like everywhere in space. I'll make them an orange. Được rồi. Vậy between the các điện tích it's pretty straightforward just the straight line and that's the hướng. Bây giờ as I start going a little bit off axis over here they start to bend like this. And again they go from positive to negative. These are what the điện trường lines look like. Được rồi let me draw a few more. You even have some that curl quite a bit. Notice that they're closely spaced between the các điện tích as I go farther out they're not as closely space Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the điện trường out here is smaller than it is between the các điện tích and there's some that are going to extend quite far away. Just not going to draw them because they're gonna be out of the picture. These are what the điện trường lines look like for this lưỡng cực. Được rồi. Vậy what if you're given an điện trường line and somebody asks you Well what is the điện trường hướng Đúng here. How would you find the điện trường hướng Đúng here. Vậy the rule is that the điện trường hướng I'm going to draw Đúng here this would be the điện trường at this point P Đúng here in THE điện trường IS ALWAYS tangent to the field line. Vậy that's kind of also an important rules they never cross. Another rule here is always tangent to the field lines. That's the điện trường hướng. Let me give you another example. What if somebody asks you what is the điện trường hướng Đúng here. Được. You draw a tangent to that line. That would be the điện trường hướng Đúng here and that's the hướng you would find is if you included the điện trường from both of them you use superposition. You would find a véctơ that points in that hướng. You notice Đúng between them. Trong trường hợp này tangent to the field line is just along the field line because it's straight to the điện trường out over here. Tangent to the field line Được Vậy that's how you could plot the hướng the độ lớn we know it's where they're closely spaced or they're farther apart the field is smaller actually I should have made this véctơ here probably a little bit smaller. Được rồi. How do they look Bây giờ for the parallel plate. Let me move over the plates a little bit. Boom. Được rồi let me draw what the field lines look like. We'll do a mono orange again. OK. We said the field was hằng số between the plates Được rồi. Vậy it kind of looks like this. Vậy a lot of people would just draw field lines that start from positive and they end at negative. They can't just end anywhere. They really have to end on positive các điện tích negative các điện tích. They start from positive and that the negative các điện tích. Được rồi and these lines should be uniformly spaced. Fill in the gaps are these are approximately uniformly spaced which means that the field over here is the same as the field over here. Đúng. It really doesn't matter. I get the same number of field lines that would cross this area. The field is uniform. Imagine here I have some plates but they're not kind of super big. Outside over here would kind of look like a lưỡng cực. We get this kind of fringing field. Again this is just a sketch. Most of the problems that you're going to deal with in class are going to assume that the các điện tích are inside over here where the field is hằng số. But in reality once you're at the edges the fields actually kind of do something like this. We call these fringing fields OK. You draw one more OK Vậy something like this. Được rồi. Vậy a lot of times you're just going to be given diagrams of điện trường lines and they might ask you which point at a given point what is the hướng of the field always tangent to the field line. Got to know where the field is strongest just look where it's dense densely packed. The other thing fields field lines always point away from positive and they have to end that negative. It would be incorrect if I did something like this. Just start a field line here and just end it Đúng here. This is this guy here is not correct. It has to end on the negative điện tích.
