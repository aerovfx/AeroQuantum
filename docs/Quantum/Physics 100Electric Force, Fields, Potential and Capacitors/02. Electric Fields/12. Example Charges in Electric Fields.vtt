00:01.060 --> 00:07.300
All right what I want to do now in this video is just to look at the emotion of charged particles between

00:07.300 --> 00:12.820
these parallel plates in order to do a lot of these problems you have to go back to kinetics.

00:12.910 --> 00:13.140
OK.

00:13.150 --> 00:16.530
In order to analyze the motion again I choose this example here.

00:16.540 --> 00:19.720
Parallel plates versus the field produced by a point charge.

00:19.720 --> 00:25.210
Because in this case the the electric field is uniform which means it's constant.

00:25.210 --> 00:25.560
OK.

00:25.590 --> 00:27.500
Let you write that down again.

00:27.900 --> 00:32.620
It's the same any position that you're looking at between these plates.

00:32.620 --> 00:38.200
And we just said earlier on that the acceleration has to be the charge that I'm going to place between

00:38.200 --> 00:46.690
those plates the electric field divided by the mass I super important equation over here.

00:46.720 --> 00:46.990
All right.

00:47.020 --> 00:54.340
So if the acceleration is constant this means I can use some simple Keenum addicts to look at the to

00:54.340 --> 00:57.730
describe the motion of a charged particle between these plates.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.090
Let me show you an example.

00:59.260 --> 01:05.360
What happens if I place a small positive charge over here and it starts to accelerate.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.180
OK I may have a certain distance here between these plates.

01:09.250 --> 01:14.080
I don't know maybe we're going to call this distance d the spacing between the plates.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.210
What if I release it from rest.

01:16.250 --> 01:16.500
OK.

01:16.510 --> 01:20.980
I would have an initial speed what if I wanted to know how long does it take before it gets to the other

01:20.980 --> 01:22.410
side.

01:23.080 --> 01:28.020
What if I wanted to know what is the speed of this little charge when it gets to the other side.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.910
And imagine this here has a charge Q All right.

01:30.910 --> 01:37.720
Another situation I could have is what if I take a negative charge and I give it some initial velocity

01:37.720 --> 01:43.510
v zero and I throw it up between the plates what happens to that charge.

01:43.530 --> 01:47.560
Right can I describe the motion of this charged particle this negative charge.

01:47.560 --> 01:53.450
Q Well as it enters the field it wants to go toward the positive plate.

01:53.470 --> 01:55.850
It wants to go away from the negative plate.

01:55.930 --> 02:03.220
In this case here if you do a free body diagram on this negative charge again I'll draw the forces here

02:03.220 --> 02:04.540
in purple.

02:04.570 --> 02:11.860
Let me draw the force the force acting on this guy here has to be in this direction and the force is

02:11.860 --> 02:13.150
constant.

02:13.150 --> 02:18.220
It also means that the acceleration is constant it's also given behind by equation up here.

02:18.520 --> 02:24.580
So we can do some kinetics now but you have to remember some of the equations for kinetics the kinetic

02:24.580 --> 02:29.930
equations are used only in the case where the acceleration is constant.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.600
If you remember back in kind of the first physics class you took.

02:33.610 --> 02:39.110
If this was Earth we had another case where the acceleration was constant.

02:39.200 --> 02:39.430
All right.

02:39.430 --> 02:44.830
If I drop an apple over here we know that the acceleration of the apple we wrote that as little g and

02:44.830 --> 02:47.800
this was nine point eight meters per second squared.

02:47.830 --> 02:52.280
That was the acceleration and the earth is kind of like a big plate.

02:52.730 --> 02:57.970
Okay if you're close to the plate the acceleration is constant kind of the same thing is this parallel

02:57.970 --> 02:58.750
plate.

02:59.170 --> 03:04.810
So if the acceleration was constant there were a whole set of equations that you can use to analyze

03:04.810 --> 03:06.570
the motion.

03:06.670 --> 03:08.070
Let me write them down.

03:08.140 --> 03:10.330
I call them the big five equations.

03:10.330 --> 03:13.990
Again they're just kind of good to remember if you don't remember we'll write them down.

03:13.990 --> 03:20.620
So we have four and five for the green charge over here.

03:20.620 --> 03:25.720
In this case it's in two dimensions so you'll really have to look at them in the x and the y direction

03:25.720 --> 03:26.260
separately.

03:26.260 --> 03:32.620
I'm just gonna write down the general equations see if you remember this one here said that the displacement

03:33.490 --> 03:39.940
in a direction is equal to one half the initial velocity plus the velocity times time.

03:39.940 --> 03:48.490
This one over here is the final velocity V.F. is equal to the initial velocity plus the acceleration

03:48.490 --> 03:50.440
times time.

03:50.590 --> 03:52.750
This one over here is also used quite a bit.

03:52.750 --> 03:58.590
The displacement equals to the initial velocity times time plus one half.

03:58.960 --> 04:05.260
80 squared is another one here which is kind of similar except it uses the final velocity.

04:05.260 --> 04:10.960
This one's probably not as popular but it had just has a different sign but it also has the different

04:10.960 --> 04:17.050
velocity right here and another one that's used quite a bit is this one the final velocity squared equals

04:17.050 --> 04:25.030
to the initial velocity squared plus two times the acceleration multiplied by the displacement for this

04:25.030 --> 04:26.240
green one over here.

04:26.290 --> 04:31.890
Again if there's only acceleration in one direction again you'd have to consider that right.

04:31.890 --> 04:37.300
We'll have to write them in the x and the y direction separately in order to analyze the motion.

04:37.360 --> 04:43.600
This guy over here looks very very similar to projectile motion right for projectile motion if you remember

04:43.600 --> 04:49.720
what you have is you have something like this and what I do is either kick a ball at a certain angle

04:50.620 --> 04:56.380
and that ball ends up doing a projectile motion and I can calculate how far it goes I can calculate

04:56.380 --> 04:59.230
the maximum height and so forth.

04:59.350 --> 05:05.230
In this case here what the projectile is going to do or the charge is in this case it's just going to

05:05.290 --> 05:06.160
get deflected.

05:06.180 --> 05:07.700
There's a force acting on it.

05:07.930 --> 05:09.890
So the motion is going to get deflected.

05:10.450 --> 05:16.540
So it would usually kind of pop out on the other side of the plates with some displacement over here

05:16.840 --> 05:17.850
in this direction.

05:19.160 --> 05:23.930
Again depending on the size of the electric field or the size of this charge it might not even make

05:23.930 --> 05:25.500
it across the plates right.

05:25.520 --> 05:28.040
It might just kind of boom hit the plate right here.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.810
It might just hit the plate right here.

05:29.810 --> 05:32.230
If there is a large force acting on it.

05:32.460 --> 05:37.580
Okay but going forward you might have to use some of these Cannon Matic equations in order to analyze

05:37.580 --> 05:43.970
the motion of charges and we're able to use these here only because we have a constant acceleration.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.180
So instead of using nine point eight over here for the acceleration instead of doing that well we're

05:50.180 --> 05:55.800
going to do is we're going to use our value that we're going to calculate inside these equations.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.020
This is going to be the acceleration.

05:58.460 --> 06:03.050
So we're gonna get a number if you know the charge the field and the mass of the particle that's entering

06:03.050 --> 06:05.180
this field and then you plug that number in.

06:05.180 --> 06:07.350
It's a constant number just put it in there.
