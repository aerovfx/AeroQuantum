00:00.840 --> 00:01.410
Hi folks.

00:01.410 --> 00:06.180
Today I want to solve a problem dealing with electric fields and more specifically I want to calculate

00:06.180 --> 00:13.440
the electric field produced by a dipole so for a dipole we have a positive charge and a negative charge

00:13.760 --> 00:18.580
and they're separated by some distance that I've denoted by the letter D.

00:18.690 --> 00:23.240
The question is I want to calculate the electric field at three specific points in space.

00:23.430 --> 00:30.500
The point p is located midway between the two charges the point X is located just above the axis and

00:30.500 --> 00:37.140
it's a distance D over to above point p and the last case I want to calculate the electric field that

00:37.140 --> 00:42.280
point y a point Y is located on the axis joining the two charges.

00:42.360 --> 00:47.460
However it's a little bit closer to the negative charge now than it is to the positive charge.

00:48.180 --> 00:53.640
So now the only thing to remember for this delay equation we really need to calculate the electric field

00:53.640 --> 00:59.580
for this problem is to remember that the electric field from any single point charged the magnitude

00:59.580 --> 01:06.960
any is given by this equation K is our constant Q Is the charge and that's the inverse squared relationship.

01:07.140 --> 01:08.810
So k q over our squared.

01:08.970 --> 01:13.550
That gives me the magnitude of the electric field produced by any specific charge.

01:13.560 --> 01:19.200
I also have to worry about the direction of the electric field so let's go to the online whiteboard

01:19.200 --> 01:21.140
and see how we solve that problem.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.490
Thanks.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.130
Okay great.

01:23.130 --> 01:24.250
So here's my dipole.

01:24.330 --> 01:26.730
Let's first consider the point p.

01:26.730 --> 01:32.940
We've got our point p located at the center point between the two charges which are separated by distance

01:32.970 --> 01:34.170
D.

01:34.170 --> 01:39.090
So to calculate the total field at this point we need to consider the contribution from the positive

01:39.090 --> 01:42.470
charge and the contribution from the negative charge.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.070
So let's draw the vectors first.

01:44.610 --> 01:50.250
If I'm only considering the positive charge let's plot that vector and read the field produce at point

01:50.250 --> 01:58.020
p by the positive charge should point away from the positive charge it points away from the positive

01:58.020 --> 01:58.920
charge.

01:58.920 --> 02:04.300
That's the convention and the magnitude we can calculate using our equation appear.

02:05.190 --> 02:10.170
All right now let's go ahead and calculate the field from the negative charge in the field from the

02:10.170 --> 02:13.190
negative charge at the point P where we want to evaluate it.

02:14.280 --> 02:19.410
It's going to have a particular magnitude and it's going to have a direction because it's a negative

02:19.410 --> 02:20.230
charge.

02:20.370 --> 02:23.880
The field points toward the negative charge.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.130
So we've got two vectors here that are pointing in the same direction.

02:28.200 --> 02:34.210
One thing you should know right away is since the distance will be the same for both and the charge

02:34.210 --> 02:34.990
is the same.

02:35.040 --> 02:39.180
Only the magnitude is different because we're dealing with an electric dipole.

02:39.240 --> 02:46.170
You should notice that the magnitudes of both of those vectors should be the same since the charge is

02:46.170 --> 02:53.270
the same in the distance to the to the charge to the point of evaluation will also be the same.

02:53.340 --> 02:58.360
In both cases the distance R is simply D over 2 for this particular point.

02:59.460 --> 03:00.990
So therefore the total field

03:04.500 --> 03:07.950
is going to be E plus plus a minus

03:13.010 --> 03:13.280
all right.

03:13.310 --> 03:18.350
We're gonna choose a convention I'm gonna call this direction here as being my positive direction.

03:18.440 --> 03:19.910
I'm free to choose whatever I want.

03:20.750 --> 03:25.040
Therefore if I want to eliminate this vector here and we'll call that the positive x direction.

03:27.210 --> 03:33.680
Okay so the total feel now is simply going to be k kill.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.690
And again the distances deal over 2 squared.

03:37.740 --> 03:47.810
That is the field from the positive charge evaluating that point P plus k q d over 2 squared.

03:47.820 --> 03:49.020
We get the exact same thing.

03:49.050 --> 03:51.960
So we get two contributions.

03:51.960 --> 03:56.830
And again the distance term is gonna be the same for both.

03:56.940 --> 04:01.900
If you simplify that a little bit you're gonna get a one over four here.

04:02.880 --> 04:11.670
Once you square everything in at the end of the day you should get eight K Q over over d squared in

04:11.670 --> 04:18.960
the direction of the field is going to be in the positive x direction and I've defined up above.

04:18.960 --> 04:19.390
All right.

04:19.560 --> 04:31.830
So the total field that point P has a magnitude of 8 q over d squared and the direction is to the left

04:34.880 --> 04:35.410
all right.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.230
So case number one is pretty straightforward.

04:40.370 --> 04:40.700
OK.

04:40.700 --> 04:50.280
Now let's look at point X point X was located above point p and it was a distance D over to above.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.640
And remember of point P was right at the center.

04:52.640 --> 04:59.380
That means at this distance here from the center line to each individual charge is also D over 2.

05:00.280 --> 05:00.550
Okay.

05:00.560 --> 05:06.020
So if we want to find the field that point X again there's gonna be two contributions to the field each

05:06.020 --> 05:07.440
one of them we know the magnitude.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.580
So let's start by drawing the vectors.

05:10.580 --> 05:17.600
The field at point X produced by this positive charge should point in this direction away from the positive

05:17.600 --> 05:18.250
charge.

05:18.330 --> 05:27.290
And I'm calling that he plus in the electric field produced by the negative charge at point X is a vector

05:27.290 --> 05:33.380
of a particular length that I'm going to denote as a minus.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.900
And it's pointing toward the negative charge.

05:36.030 --> 05:36.250
Right.

05:36.280 --> 05:39.900
If you continue this line here should go right through the negative charge.

05:40.700 --> 05:41.120
Okay.

05:41.330 --> 05:45.010
So all we have to do now is simply add those up as vectors.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.160
Now one thing you should note

05:49.070 --> 05:54.400
is the vertical components of those vectors are going to cancel out.

05:54.410 --> 05:59.390
Again we're dealing with the electric field from a dipole so that means that this charge is equal in

05:59.390 --> 06:02.150
magnitude but opposite sign from the negative charge.

06:02.780 --> 06:07.750
And also the distance from the point to each charge is going to be the same.

06:07.760 --> 06:14.150
So that means when you substitute things into our equation for the electric fuel produced by one individual

06:14.150 --> 06:16.840
charge you have the same magnitude.

06:16.850 --> 06:22.250
You also have the same distance from the point where we evaluate the field to the charge.

06:22.250 --> 06:26.690
Therefore both of those vectors have the same magnitude.

06:27.470 --> 06:33.370
So when you add them up as vectors at the end let's drive a little bit clear down here at the bottom

06:34.430 --> 06:43.400
so we've got a vector in this direction he plus and we've also got a vector in this direction.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.770
He minus.

06:46.400 --> 06:50.000
So now let's find the actual magnitudes of each one of those vectors

06:53.440 --> 06:55.860
so we can start with the first one.

06:56.260 --> 07:01.360
All we really need to find is what is the distance from the charge to the point of the valuation.

07:01.420 --> 07:01.620
Right.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.210
And that distance is simply this one over here on the figure.

07:04.210 --> 07:13.240
This is r that's very easy to solve because we know the distance from the charge to the midpoint and

07:13.240 --> 07:16.630
we know the distance from the midpoint to the point of observation.

07:16.720 --> 07:21.400
Therefore we should be able to solve what is the length of that top side.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.110
Each one of these is d over 2.

07:24.670 --> 07:30.360
Therefore R to use Pythagorean theorem.

07:32.930 --> 07:33.830
Okay.

07:33.930 --> 07:35.240
Now you could simplify this.

07:35.240 --> 07:41.110
We're going to get d over a square root of 2 so there's the distance.

07:41.570 --> 07:55.100
So the magnitude of E plus we do it over here magnitude of E plus is simply k q and divided by our square

07:55.670 --> 08:00.000
r squared is gonna be d squared divided by two.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.870
I'll just put the two up on top here.

08:02.870 --> 08:09.570
The magnitude of E minus is also going to be the same.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.810
The only thing that's different is the orientation or the direction that vector.

08:14.950 --> 08:20.050
So at the end now what we have to do is we simply have to break both of those vectors down into two

08:20.050 --> 08:21.880
components.

08:21.880 --> 08:28.020
This year we'll have a horizontal component and a vertical component.

08:28.630 --> 08:36.820
Likewise with the green vector we have a horizontal component and a vertical component of the vector

08:36.850 --> 08:38.940
e minus.

08:40.090 --> 08:46.760
And you should see that both of these vectors at least the vertical components cancel so if we choose

08:46.760 --> 08:56.240
a coordinate system let's choose a coordinate system where we have positive why it's pointing up and

08:56.240 --> 09:01.270
positive X is pointing to the left.

09:01.710 --> 09:02.730
Okay.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.490
And if you want to find the field in the y direction

09:11.860 --> 09:18.000
let's call the angle that that vector makes with respect to the horizontal it's theta.

09:18.130 --> 09:24.140
And again you can find theta because it's gonna be the same angle as the angle over here.

09:24.220 --> 09:33.940
Since both of those sides are the same you should know that the angle theta should be forty five degrees.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.010
So in the y direction what do we have.

09:36.010 --> 09:47.770
We've got he total in the y direction is equal to E plus in the y direction.

09:48.140 --> 09:52.890
And now the component of E minus in the y direction is pointing down.

09:53.150 --> 09:59.450
I would call that negative and at the end that components very easy.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.780
It equals to zero.

10:01.780 --> 10:10.370
Well all we have to do now is simply find the vector in the x direction and again both of those are

10:10.370 --> 10:12.240
gonna have the exact same length.

10:12.530 --> 10:20.900
So the total field in the x direction is gonna be twice whatever the x component of E pluses and the

10:20.900 --> 10:22.620
x component its cos of theta.

10:25.250 --> 10:30.710
So now we can substitute everything we know the two is the fact that we have both vectors pointing in

10:30.710 --> 10:32.190
the same direction.

10:32.420 --> 10:42.860
The magnitude of E plus I've got a written there on the side it's 2 k divided by D squared and coast

10:42.860 --> 10:43.390
of theta.

10:43.400 --> 10:49.780
That's code of forty five degrees coast of forty five degrees is Route 2 over 2.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.710
You can simplify a few things

10:55.760 --> 11:04.890
at the end while we're left with is 2 square root of 2 k divided by D squared.

11:04.970 --> 11:08.330
That is the total field at point X.

11:08.930 --> 11:13.810
So this one's a little bit tricky because the vectors are not along the same axis.

11:14.450 --> 11:20.540
However there is some simplification because the y components cancel out and we're left with both components

11:20.540 --> 11:28.670
of the X both x components adding together to give us a total field in the x direction with this magnitude

11:29.600 --> 11:31.400
2 square root of 2.

11:31.850 --> 11:37.180
Multiply times the constant I can't forget the charge q divided by D squared.

11:38.290 --> 11:38.640
Okay.

11:40.260 --> 11:44.970
Okay so now let's consider the total electric field produce at point Y.

11:45.110 --> 11:51.820
Again we're gonna have two contributions we have a contribution from the positive charge at point y.

11:51.860 --> 11:57.830
That's a vector pointing away from the positive charge and we also have an electric field produced by

11:57.830 --> 11:59.780
the negative charge at point y.

11:59.930 --> 12:03.530
And that vector should point toward the negative charge.

12:03.540 --> 12:06.860
Now we can easily calculate the magnitude of each one.

12:07.280 --> 12:12.380
The magnitude of E plus is K Q And what is the distance.

12:12.380 --> 12:16.240
Now the distance is D plus D over 2.

12:16.280 --> 12:24.740
Well that's three D over two and you can't forget the square that guy at the end of the day you expand

12:24.740 --> 12:28.450
this power to and what do we get.

12:28.460 --> 12:35.520
We're gonna get 4 k q divided by 9 D squared.

12:35.750 --> 12:42.170
That's the magnitude of the electric field produced by the positive charge.

12:42.180 --> 12:47.480
Now let's consider the negative charge k q that terms the same.

12:47.480 --> 12:48.380
What is the distance now.

12:48.380 --> 12:53.320
The distance is only D over to a much smaller distance do you over too.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.500
And don't forget to square that term.

12:55.600 --> 13:00.500
So at the end of the day when we expand everything we can write out that the electric field produced

13:00.500 --> 13:05.430
by the negative charge has a magnitude of K key over d squared.

13:06.970 --> 13:07.600
Okay.

13:07.610 --> 13:13.220
So the total field now again I'm going to choose a coordinate system where everything pointing to the

13:13.220 --> 13:14.210
left is positive.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.330
You're free to do whatever you want at this point.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.140
And now the total field

13:20.870 --> 13:33.770
the magnitude of the total field is going to be plus four nights Kate Q divided by D squared and minus

13:34.370 --> 13:40.750
minus because this vector here is pointing to the right and I've decided that that direction is gonna

13:40.760 --> 13:46.110
be the negative direction for k q divided by D squared.

13:47.040 --> 13:47.420
Okay.

13:47.450 --> 13:49.030
So you just gotta do a little bit of algebra.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.580
Here we have four nights minus what is this.

13:52.580 --> 13:58.180
Thirty six nights and everything is multiplied times the same factor here.

13:58.190 --> 14:06.200
Kick you over d squared and at the end of the day we are left with that the total feel that point Y

14:08.090 --> 14:21.150
is equal to minus thirty two over nine K Q divided by D squared.

14:21.320 --> 14:29.690
Negative negative for vectors simply tells me the direction and that tells me that this vector here

14:30.320 --> 14:34.110
points to the right and that makes sense right.

14:34.130 --> 14:42.260
Because the fuel produced by the negative charge is going to be bigger at point Y because the distance

14:42.260 --> 14:49.670
to the point Y is much closer for the positive charge the distance is much larger it's three D over

14:49.670 --> 14:53.770
two words for the negative charge it was only D over two.

14:54.160 --> 14:54.560
Okay.

14:54.650 --> 15:00.620
So at any point in space you simply have to consider two vectors the vectors the electric field produced

15:00.620 --> 15:03.110
by each charge.

15:03.110 --> 15:07.970
Just be careful how you add them up and you should be able to find the electric field anywhere in space.
