00:00.120 --> 00:03.660
All right what I want to do now folks is look at a different geometry.

00:03.770 --> 00:04.010
OK.

00:04.020 --> 00:04.950
So we've looked at.

00:04.950 --> 00:10.230
If I have a positive point charge I can go everywhere in space and I could say well what's the electric

00:10.230 --> 00:11.340
field right here.

00:11.460 --> 00:11.670
Right.

00:11.660 --> 00:16.290
You could draw it draw an electric field vector and you can calculate its magnitude right as long as

00:16.290 --> 00:18.230
you know the distance right here.

00:18.240 --> 00:24.630
So here I would say it's simply k q over R squared and the direction of the vector if it's a positive

00:24.630 --> 00:30.100
point charge that's producing it the electric field points away from positive charges.

00:30.160 --> 00:30.410
Okay.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.350
Well now I have another question for you.

00:32.400 --> 00:39.090
What happens now if I have instead of one point charge if I have a large plate.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.070
So here's a large plate.

00:41.260 --> 00:42.390
Let's just call it like this.

00:42.390 --> 00:46.030
So it's just really a two dimensional plate.

00:46.070 --> 00:47.060
It has a little thickness.

00:47.070 --> 00:48.300
But let's just neglect that.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.150
So it's really two dimensional object.

00:51.150 --> 00:58.350
And what I'm going to do now is on this plate I am going to produce or say remove a whole bunch of electrons

00:59.160 --> 01:03.180
in such a way that this plate here becomes positively charged.

01:03.320 --> 01:08.310
They will just keep on drawing a few of them but there's a whole bunch of these individual point charges

01:08.310 --> 01:15.120
here but they're spread out kind of all over this two dimensional surface.

01:15.120 --> 01:15.380
All right.

01:15.390 --> 01:17.840
Imagine now I wanted to know well what it is.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.660
The if I just pick a direction here that's perpendicular to the plate.

01:22.020 --> 01:27.480
What is the direction of the electric field right here at some point that is above the plate.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.690
It could be some height h above the plate.

01:30.780 --> 01:37.320
Now again although I drew this little area right here again I'm assuming that this area is actually

01:37.320 --> 01:38.950
pretty large.

01:40.980 --> 01:46.050
So I'm just going to write these arrows just to tell you that it's kind of extended pretty large and

01:46.050 --> 01:48.940
I'm at a point that's close to the surface of the plate.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.080
Which direction with the electric field be it.

01:51.620 --> 01:51.850
OK.

01:52.110 --> 01:57.750
Well again you would use the equation for the point charges but you would have to add up all the contributions

01:57.750 --> 01:59.530
from all the point charges.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.350
For example I'd have to add this one.

02:01.380 --> 02:07.060
So this one here produces an electric field at the red point which is something like this.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.650
Now every time there is a point charge on this side there's going to be one on the other side.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.130
That's going to oppose it.

02:13.240 --> 02:19.970
It's going to produce it's its electric field in this direction at the end when we add those as vectors.

02:20.060 --> 02:26.850
Turns out that the electric field is only going to be pointing away from the plate if it's positively

02:26.850 --> 02:27.830
charged.

02:27.860 --> 02:28.080
Okay.

02:28.110 --> 02:32.400
Because every time you have a point charged on one side you'll always have another one on the other

02:32.400 --> 02:32.750
side.

02:32.760 --> 02:38.970
So there's can't be any contribution or any component of the electric fuel that's in the plane of the

02:38.970 --> 02:40.490
plate.

02:40.490 --> 02:40.760
OK.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.960
So let's just define a couple of things.

02:43.020 --> 02:47.650
First of all we have our area of the plate.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.150
What else.

02:48.150 --> 02:50.820
Well we want to know how much charge do we place on that plate.

02:50.820 --> 02:51.940
Is that a lot of charge.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.480
Is it a little bit of charge.

02:53.490 --> 02:53.990
OK.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.520
So I'm going to define something.

02:55.620 --> 03:05.860
There is something called Sigma Sigma is what we're going to call a surface charge density surface charge

03:06.910 --> 03:13.630
density and this quantity is important to calculate the electric field from the plate.

03:14.380 --> 03:16.680
The definition of this in terms of other variables.

03:16.690 --> 03:26.770
So a charge density is how much total charge do I have divided by the total area of the plate.

03:27.320 --> 03:33.290
Now this is important this quantity here because it's used to calculate the electric field produced

03:33.290 --> 03:35.380
by this object by this plate.

03:35.870 --> 03:41.100
So the electric field produced by this plate which I'm going to write here just using a purple E.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.840
Now we know the direction if it's positively charged the electric field points away from it.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.880
If it's negatively charged the electric fuel points toward it.

03:48.910 --> 03:56.960
So that convention hasn't changed the magnitude of the field produced by a charged plate it can be written

03:56.960 --> 03:58.610
some like this.

03:58.610 --> 04:04.130
Now have a look it's different from the point charged depend on this charge density and the rest of

04:04.130 --> 04:07.980
it depends on two Epsilon 0.

04:08.750 --> 04:11.440
Pretty simple equation.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.590
Now I just wrote the magnitude here of the electric field the direction of the electric field again.

04:16.620 --> 04:17.790
We know that.

04:17.940 --> 04:23.360
So notice here it doesn't actually depend on the distance H right.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.090
H was the point.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.520
How far away I was from that surface in here.

04:28.560 --> 04:34.190
This electric field the really important thing here is that it is a constant value.

04:35.780 --> 04:40.890
If it's a constant value it means it doesn't depend if you're close to the plate or a little bit farther

04:40.890 --> 04:42.020
away.

04:42.090 --> 04:44.980
Again we're assuming we have a really really large plate.

04:45.120 --> 04:45.380
All right.

04:45.660 --> 04:50.360
So let's have a look at this formula a little bit more detail now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

04:50.400 --> 04:53.310
place two of these plates next to each other.

04:53.310 --> 04:58.590
This is what we call parallel plates and let's look at the electric field produced by parallel plates.
