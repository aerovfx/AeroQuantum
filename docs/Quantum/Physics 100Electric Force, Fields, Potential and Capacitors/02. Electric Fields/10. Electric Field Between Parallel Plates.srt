00:00.310 --> 00:06.210
OK so to illustrate this a little bit now what I want to do is I just want to draw a cross section of

00:06.210 --> 00:07.530
my plate.

00:07.530 --> 00:07.730
All right.

00:07.740 --> 00:10.280
So let me go ahead and draw a plate here.

00:10.350 --> 00:11.070
I'm going to make it.

00:11.070 --> 00:14.220
Give it a little bit of thickness just like this.

00:14.220 --> 00:18.610
So again the area goes in and out of the page here over here.

00:18.790 --> 00:26.970
And let's assume now that I again I it's a conductor and I've placed some charges on this plate.

00:27.060 --> 00:31.810
And again those charges are going to evenly distribute.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.330
They really want to repel each other.

00:33.330 --> 00:39.090
So what we have here is some charge density which is the total charge divided by the area.

00:39.090 --> 00:39.290
All right.

00:39.290 --> 00:43.650
How would you go ahead now and plot this electric field vector everywhere in space here.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.870
So on the left hand side and on the right hand side.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.280
Well again what I would do is I would just plod vectors right.

00:49.320 --> 00:55.230
The vector at this point is a vector that points away from it everywhere with simply point away from

00:55.230 --> 00:56.660
the plate.

00:56.730 --> 01:01.940
I would equally space those vectors because the field is uniform everywhere.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.760
And the magnitude of this field again.

01:04.770 --> 01:06.460
Here's the equation right here.

01:06.480 --> 01:11.900
So in this case here would be Sigma divided by two times my constant Epsilon 0.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.390
That is the magnitude of the electric field here.

01:14.490 --> 01:15.950
The same everywhere.

01:16.020 --> 01:17.960
How about on the left hand side of the plate.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.140
Again I would do the same thing

01:22.130 --> 01:22.350
again.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.920
This is when I'm close to the plate.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.210
I can move a little bit farther away from the plate.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.420
And this is what the electric field looks like.

01:28.470 --> 01:30.330
Again e is the same magnitude here.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.320
Even if I move farther away.

01:33.040 --> 01:33.210
All right.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.540
This is what I have to have.

01:34.560 --> 01:40.970
The field simply points away from that plate and it's constant everywhere.

01:40.970 --> 01:47.930
Let me do one more set of vectors over here and then we'll add another plate to this configuration.

01:47.970 --> 01:48.290
All right.

01:48.300 --> 01:50.350
So far so good.

01:50.370 --> 01:51.330
Last thing I want to do now.

01:51.330 --> 01:52.730
Well let's add another plate.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.470
Let's maybe put it over here.

01:55.590 --> 01:58.470
I'll draw a similar plate.

01:58.520 --> 02:02.610
The question now is well what kind of charge do I want to place on this plate.

02:03.030 --> 02:04.620
Let's play some negative charges.

02:04.650 --> 02:10.050
So we add some additional electrons on that plate.

02:10.050 --> 02:15.720
Now what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to put the same number of electrons let's assume

02:15.720 --> 02:17.450
those are the same size.

02:17.520 --> 02:17.780
All right.

02:17.790 --> 02:23.670
So that the charge density for this plate over here is going to be well it's going to be a negative

02:23.670 --> 02:27.000
total charge divided by the same area.

02:27.540 --> 02:33.890
So this is negatively charge.

02:34.070 --> 02:39.280
So what would the electric field look like produced by the negative plate.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.850
How would we how would we plot that.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.020
Well let's go ahead and draw vectors again.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.350
It's a plate.

02:45.350 --> 02:46.970
So the formula is this.

02:46.970 --> 02:48.660
That's the magnitude.

02:48.830 --> 02:53.030
The only difference now is that the electric field points toward it.

02:53.050 --> 02:57.980
So I would have to add a whole bunch of vectors everywhere in space that are pointing toward

03:00.600 --> 03:02.110
this plate.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.250
How about on the left hand side.

03:04.380 --> 03:09.150
Again I have to add a whole bunch of vectors that are pointing toward it.

03:10.020 --> 03:13.540
Or that I draw a whole bunch of them here.

03:13.620 --> 03:16.840
Let's just keep on going just on want this is a really really important thing.

03:18.930 --> 03:23.610
And then we're going to look at the total electric field everywhere in space.

03:23.610 --> 03:26.300
But for now we're going to continue everywhere.

03:26.310 --> 03:31.220
When I'm on the left hand side of this plate the blue one over here the negatively charged plate.

03:31.230 --> 03:34.540
I have to have vectors that are pointing toward it.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.380
All right what we have now are really three regions.

03:37.380 --> 03:42.910
We have region number one which is over on the left hand side of the positive plate.

03:43.080 --> 03:47.400
I have region number two which is going to be between both plates.

03:47.490 --> 03:54.010
And here I have region number three which is going to be to the right of the negatively charged plate.

03:54.030 --> 03:59.920
My goal now is really define what is the total electric field everywhere in space.

04:00.420 --> 04:04.790
So let me just kind of make myself a little bit of room to do some writing here.

04:04.800 --> 04:10.890
So let me just kind of delete these and I can write the total field if you first have a look here what

04:10.890 --> 04:11.910
is the total field.

04:11.910 --> 04:14.750
Well have a look at these two vectors.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.020
What we have here are two vectors that are in the opposite direction and they have the exact same magnitude.

04:22.050 --> 04:24.420
So that means that the total field in this region

04:27.130 --> 04:29.500
total field here has to be equal to zero.

04:29.500 --> 04:36.170
There is no field anywhere over here because these vectors cancel out let's have a look at Region three

04:36.170 --> 04:39.430
region three is something similar is going on here.

04:39.680 --> 04:45.760
What I have here are two vectors cancelling out let me go ahead and write that out vectors cancel.

04:45.950 --> 04:48.230
All right the electric fields cancel.

04:48.230 --> 04:56.530
So that means that the total electric field in this region has to be equal to zero.

04:56.550 --> 04:56.790
All right.

04:56.790 --> 05:00.830
And the last one well let's look at what's going on in the center doesn't matter which one you consider

05:00.840 --> 05:02.780
look at these two vectors right here.

05:02.880 --> 05:09.000
There are two vectors that have the exact same length the length of the vectors given by this except

05:09.000 --> 05:12.020
now they're pointing in the same direction.

05:12.060 --> 05:15.500
So if I plot the total electric field it should be something like this.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.830
This should be e total

05:19.800 --> 05:20.750
let's go ahead and write it out.

05:20.820 --> 05:26.030
So e total should be the field produced by the red one

05:29.400 --> 05:29.780
all right.

05:29.780 --> 05:32.950
Plus the field produced by the blue one.

05:32.960 --> 05:37.830
While the magnitude of that field is Sigma over to Epsilon 0.

05:38.330 --> 05:45.380
So that means that the total field at the end of the day is 1 while simply Epsilon over zero.

05:45.690 --> 05:45.940
Right.

05:45.940 --> 05:53.270
So between the plates you go ahead and write this down right over here between the plates the fields

05:53.270 --> 05:55.440
are additive.

05:56.480 --> 05:59.210
The total field the magnitude.

05:59.210 --> 06:04.520
We know the direction that the direction has to be pointing away from positive and pointing toward the

06:04.520 --> 06:05.230
negative.

06:05.390 --> 06:12.820
But the total magnitude then is simply the charge density divided by epsilon 0.

06:12.980 --> 06:15.710
Okay super super important.

06:15.830 --> 06:18.770
And again what we have here is a constant.

06:18.860 --> 06:21.460
It's still a constant electric field.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.410
It's the same everywhere in space.

06:23.410 --> 06:28.550
So really I could draw other vectors over here between the plates the electric field is uniform.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.650
It's the same if it was right here as it is right here.

06:33.920 --> 06:39.320
If someone asks you compare the electric field at this point versus this point versus this point they

06:39.320 --> 06:41.010
all have to be the same.

06:41.150 --> 06:45.200
They're all the same and they're all equal to the total electric field between the plates.
