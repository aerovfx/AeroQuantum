00:00.270 --> 00:06.990
All right we focused quite a bit on drawing the vectors for electric fields produced by various objects

00:06.990 --> 00:09.180
for example positive point charge here.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.720
Case number one this is my point.

00:11.730 --> 00:15.860
I COULD SAY THIS IS THE ELECTRIC FIELD produced by this one.

00:16.020 --> 00:20.310
If it's a dipole I choose the point right over here I could say yeah the electric field points like

00:20.310 --> 00:27.060
this away from the positive toward the negative and we just saw that for the parallel plate for the

00:27.060 --> 00:27.950
parallel plate.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.600
If I draw the electric field vector anywhere for example right here at this point it would point away

00:33.600 --> 00:36.510
from the positive toward the negative.

00:36.510 --> 00:41.550
Now if you start doing this at all different points around the objects you know it can kind of take

00:41.550 --> 00:46.920
a long time because you really have to go everywhere in space and start drawing the vector right as

00:46.920 --> 00:51.650
you kind of start going away from the point charge you'd have to make the vector a little bit smaller.

00:51.800 --> 00:52.650
Right.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.110
Always pointing away from it.

00:54.130 --> 00:58.730
All right if I go all the way over here again pointing away from it it would be something like this.

00:58.740 --> 01:03.090
So typically what people do is they don't really plot the vectors everywhere.

01:03.090 --> 01:08.640
What we do instead is we plot electric field lines and this is kind of what they look like.

01:09.450 --> 01:14.250
Again you can imagine having all these vectors here kind of spaced out and what we're gonna do is we're

01:14.250 --> 01:16.010
simply going to loops.

01:16.020 --> 01:24.580
Let's let's use the marker instead what we're gonna do here is we're going to simply produce lines or

01:24.600 --> 01:26.600
connect these vectors by lines.

01:26.610 --> 01:26.840
OK.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.720
The lines are continuous.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.510
So they would kind of look like this or imagine all of these vectors here pointing along this orange

01:33.510 --> 01:35.320
line.

01:35.320 --> 01:42.710
And this is going to be a different representation of the same electric field so we call these electric

01:42.710 --> 01:43.410
field lines.

01:43.430 --> 01:46.280
So for a point charge they would look like this.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.300
Now we have to give a direction to them.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.570
So the direction that we're going to pick again it's going to be the same thing.

01:51.740 --> 01:55.540
First of all they're going to point away from positive point charges.

01:56.800 --> 01:57.180
OK.

01:57.230 --> 01:58.280
So that's the direction.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.890
So that's kind of easy to remember it's the same as the vectors and these are called electric field

02:03.890 --> 02:06.280
lines.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.410
Notice they are just continuous lines.

02:08.540 --> 02:08.750
OK.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.320
There's no kind of break here between them.

02:11.330 --> 02:20.280
The other thing that we notice about them is the electric field lines they never cross.

02:20.350 --> 02:22.690
They're kind of all independent lines.

02:22.690 --> 02:27.430
The other thing we wanted to know is well if we have a vector for electric field not only do we know

02:27.430 --> 02:31.560
the direction but we also know kind of how big it is just from the length.

02:31.900 --> 02:33.840
How about electric field lines.

02:33.920 --> 02:37.990
And if you're given a picture of electric field lines how do you know where the field is the biggest

02:38.360 --> 02:38.620
hit.

02:38.620 --> 02:44.250
Well all you have to do then is consider like a play a point or an area that's close to this charge.

02:44.250 --> 02:44.380
Right.

02:44.410 --> 02:52.230
If you consider over here right over here you could see I have two field lines that cross this area

02:53.290 --> 03:00.130
whereas over here in space if I draw kind of the same area you see I only have one over here.

03:00.910 --> 03:06.460
So then when you have a large number of field lines that cross an area that tells you where the field

03:06.460 --> 03:07.450
is the biggest.

03:07.530 --> 03:07.710
OK.

03:07.750 --> 03:13.240
So you have to look at it so close the charges you're going to have a lot of field lines that are closely

03:13.240 --> 03:15.840
spaced when you get far away.

03:15.850 --> 03:20.430
You see the field lines here are farther apart.

03:20.740 --> 03:23.530
So that means that the electric field is smaller

03:28.090 --> 03:35.030
OK an electric field over here is bigger because the field lines are close together.

03:35.390 --> 03:37.520
Let's have a look at the dipole field lines.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.660
I want to go ahead and draw them.

03:38.660 --> 03:44.300
I'm going to move it over a little bit just so we can have a bit more space and let's draw what the

03:44.300 --> 03:48.740
electric field lines look like everywhere in space.

03:48.890 --> 03:50.780
I'll make them an orange.

03:50.780 --> 03:51.050
All right.

03:51.050 --> 03:55.970
So between the charges it's pretty straightforward just the straight line and that's the direction.

03:56.060 --> 04:00.990
Now as I start going a little bit off axis over here they start to bend like this.

04:01.570 --> 04:03.800
And again they go from positive to negative.

04:03.830 --> 04:11.060
These are what the electric field lines look like.

04:11.070 --> 04:13.350
All right let me draw a few more.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.630
You even have some that curl quite a bit.

04:15.630 --> 04:25.060
Notice that they're closely spaced between the charges as I go farther out they're not as closely space

04:25.060 --> 04:31.090
so that means that the electric field out here is smaller than it is between the charges and there's

04:31.100 --> 04:33.730
some that are going to extend quite far away.

04:33.950 --> 04:37.450
Just not going to draw them because they're gonna be out of the picture.

04:37.530 --> 04:41.720
These are what the electric field lines look like for this dipole.

04:42.830 --> 04:43.220
All right.

04:43.220 --> 04:48.140
So what if you're given an electric field line and somebody asks you Well what is the electric field

04:48.140 --> 04:50.610
direction right here.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.910
How would you find the electric field direction right here.

04:52.910 --> 04:58.610
So the rule is that the electric field direction I'm going to draw right here this would be the electric

04:58.610 --> 05:06.710
field at this point P right here in THE ELECTRIC FIELD IS ALWAYS tangent to the field line.

05:06.730 --> 05:10.400
So that's kind of also an important rules they never cross.

05:10.400 --> 05:23.950
Another rule here is always tangent to the field lines.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.600
That's the electric field direction.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.260
Let me give you another example.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.350
What if somebody asks you what is the electric field direction right here.

05:31.820 --> 05:32.100
Okay.

05:32.110 --> 05:34.790
You draw a tangent to that line.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.700
That would be the electric field direction right here and that's the direction you would find is if

05:39.700 --> 05:43.300
you included the electric field from both of them you use superposition.

05:43.390 --> 05:46.150
You would find a vector that points in that direction.

05:46.150 --> 05:48.190
You notice right between them.

05:48.190 --> 05:53.920
In this case tangent to the field line is just along the field line because it's straight to the electric

05:53.920 --> 05:55.070
field out over here.

05:55.150 --> 06:02.220
Tangent to the field line Okay so that's how you could plot the direction the magnitude we know it's

06:02.220 --> 06:06.930
where they're closely spaced or they're farther apart the field is smaller actually I should have made

06:06.930 --> 06:09.810
this vector here probably a little bit smaller.

06:09.930 --> 06:10.190
All right.

06:10.200 --> 06:13.170
How do they look now for the parallel plate.

06:13.530 --> 06:17.920
Let me move over the plates a little bit.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.080
Boom.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.320
All right let me draw what the field lines look like.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.550
We'll do a mono orange again.

06:22.620 --> 06:22.820
OK.

06:22.830 --> 06:26.870
We said the field was constant between the plates all right.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.200
So it kind of looks like this.

06:28.230 --> 06:33.680
So a lot of people would just draw field lines that start from positive and they end at negative.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.370
They can't just end anywhere.

06:36.510 --> 06:40.750
They really have to end on positive charges negative charges.

06:40.970 --> 06:44.730
They start from positive and that the negative charges.

06:44.730 --> 06:48.230
All right and these lines should be uniformly spaced.

06:48.810 --> 06:55.320
Fill in the gaps are these are approximately uniformly spaced which means that the field over here is

06:55.320 --> 06:57.180
the same as the field over here.

06:57.270 --> 06:57.450
Right.

06:57.450 --> 06:58.290
It really doesn't matter.

06:58.290 --> 07:01.710
I get the same number of field lines that would cross this area.

07:01.710 --> 07:03.320
The field is uniform.

07:03.450 --> 07:07.760
Imagine here I have some plates but they're not kind of super big.

07:08.370 --> 07:10.830
Outside over here would kind of look like a dipole.

07:10.980 --> 07:13.840
We get this kind of fringing field.

07:13.980 --> 07:15.580
Again this is just a sketch.

07:15.600 --> 07:20.220
Most of the problems that you're going to deal with in class are going to assume that the charges are

07:20.220 --> 07:23.610
inside over here where the field is constant.

07:23.610 --> 07:29.040
But in reality once you're at the edges the fields actually kind of do something like this.

07:29.130 --> 07:31.140
We call these fringing fields

07:37.370 --> 07:38.000
OK.

07:38.180 --> 07:43.390
You draw one more OK so something like this.

07:43.440 --> 07:43.710
All right.

07:43.710 --> 07:49.230
So a lot of times you're just going to be given diagrams of electric field lines and they might ask

07:49.230 --> 07:56.150
you which point at a given point what is the direction of the field always tangent to the field line.

07:56.170 --> 08:02.440
Got to know where the field is strongest just look where it's dense densely packed.

08:02.460 --> 08:08.280
The other thing fields field lines always point away from positive and they have to end that negative.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.310
It would be incorrect if I did something like this.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.640
Just start a field line here and just end it right here.

08:13.770 --> 08:17.900
This is this guy here is not correct.

08:17.910 --> 08:19.740
It has to end on the negative charge.
