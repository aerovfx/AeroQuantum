Yeah so I just wanted to just at least put another slide together about this field inside a conductor.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.810
This is often called a Faraday cage.

00:09.030 --> 00:14.310
Again imagine we have this metal box here which is showing some of the charges outside and there's no

00:14.310 --> 00:17.790
electric field right now anywhere in space.

00:17.790 --> 00:22.610
Now what happens if I produce a large electric field in space somehow.

00:22.610 --> 00:30.110
So in this case here somehow there is a big electric field being produced by another object.

00:30.420 --> 00:37.860
And what that will do again is the electrons in this metal want to go in the opposite direction that's

00:37.860 --> 00:39.780
where the forces.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.730
That's the direction of the force acting on the negative charge.

00:42.730 --> 00:47.340
So you could see that they're going to pile up more on this left side than the right side.

00:47.520 --> 00:48.130
Right.

00:48.270 --> 00:53.600
Because there's a force acting on them they are placed in a strong electric field.

00:53.820 --> 00:57.840
So that means that if you look at the kind of the red kind of dashed line over here that means if I

00:57.840 --> 01:04.800
compare one side of the cage to the other I have have a force on those electrons which means that one

01:04.800 --> 01:11.960
side becomes more positively charged and the other side of the cage becomes more negatively charged.

01:11.970 --> 01:17.220
So that means that these induced charges also produce an electric field.

01:17.280 --> 01:23.070
So you really get two fields you get the one produced by the charges and the metal and you get the first

01:23.070 --> 01:25.680
field that was there in the first place right.

01:25.770 --> 01:30.240
And at the end those fields are going to cancel out by themselves.

01:30.270 --> 01:31.050
OK.

01:31.080 --> 01:35.850
And if they cancel out it means that the total electric field at the end of the day should be equal

01:35.850 --> 01:40.150
to zero or pretty small inside the cage.

01:40.200 --> 01:44.480
And here you can often see pictures of actually real world applications actually.

01:44.490 --> 01:50.550
This guy is a little crazy this guy this thing over here is a helmet holds.

01:51.770 --> 01:56.130
So this is called a Tesla coil to try that again a tesla coil.

01:56.130 --> 02:01.860
And basically what it does is it produces really really large electric fields so large that it's able

02:01.860 --> 02:09.360
to ionized the air all right and if you're able to ionized the air anywhere you have this giant electric

02:09.360 --> 02:14.340
field over here then you can see this guy is inside a metal cage.

02:14.340 --> 02:18.580
And again we only have a series of wires over here.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.690
All right there's a series of wires that form a cage.

02:21.690 --> 02:27.300
It doesn't have to be a full conductor and you know he's not being electrocuted he's not being zapped

02:27.630 --> 02:28.180
right.

02:28.350 --> 02:33.900
So we have actually a cancellation of electric fields and you can place either a human in there.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.570
Sometimes these Faraday Cages are used to store sensitive equipment.

02:38.670 --> 02:41.320
You might place it inside a metal box.

02:41.330 --> 02:41.980
OK.

02:42.030 --> 02:45.980
In order not to have it exposed to strong electric fields.

02:46.440 --> 02:46.770
OK.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.920
So that's kind of the concept of the Faraday cage.
