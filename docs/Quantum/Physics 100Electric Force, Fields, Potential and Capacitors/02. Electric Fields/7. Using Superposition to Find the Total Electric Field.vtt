00:00.240 --> 00:00.490
All right.

00:00.510 --> 00:05.010
So here's our two point charges here we have a positive and a negative.

00:05.050 --> 00:09.930
What I'm gonna do here is I'm actually going to trace it along over here.

00:09.930 --> 00:12.360
So this is going to be a positive x axis.

00:12.360 --> 00:19.890
I'll place a positive charge over here right here and I'll place a negative charge a certain distance

00:19.890 --> 00:20.170
away.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.930
Let's try to keep it roughly the same.

00:22.080 --> 00:27.420
Again both of these the charges down here you could see there are each one of them is one nano Coolum

00:27.840 --> 00:29.980
one positive and one is negative.

00:30.210 --> 00:35.430
So let's first look at the area in between and it doesn't matter which point I take.

00:35.430 --> 00:41.350
Let's imagine I take a point that is right on the center line over here between the two charges.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.710
So let me draw another set of axes.

00:43.960 --> 00:50.060
Another axis the y axis and then you place a point right here at the center.

00:50.090 --> 00:50.640
OK.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.900
Now I want to do is remember the field produced by each one of those is given by our equation because

00:55.900 --> 00:57.900
they are both point charges.

00:57.900 --> 01:00.480
It's k q over R squared.

01:00.700 --> 01:07.680
Yeah one thing you should see from this line over here if this is the y axis and this is exactly at

01:07.680 --> 01:10.010
the midpoint between the two.

01:10.530 --> 01:13.220
I imagine you call this distance x.

01:13.770 --> 01:19.830
You also call this distance x you could see right away that the distance between the two charges in

01:19.830 --> 01:23.060
this point is going to be the same distance.

01:23.100 --> 01:27.000
I don't know what you want to call it let's call it R and call it r right.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.460
And this is the point P where I want to evaluate the field you can see it's going to be the same.

01:32.740 --> 01:33.020
OK.

01:33.030 --> 01:34.110
So now what would you do.

01:34.110 --> 01:37.620
Well if I wanted to plot what does the total field look like right here.

01:37.770 --> 01:43.710
Again maybe start with the positive point charge the positive point charge produces an electric field

01:44.580 --> 01:45.880
that looks like this.

01:45.990 --> 01:51.890
The magnitude of that field is going to be k q over our squared.

01:52.020 --> 01:52.260
All right.

01:52.260 --> 01:57.780
How about the field produced by the negative point charge the field produced by the negative point charge

01:57.780 --> 02:04.170
is going to be a vector that points toward the negative charge and its magnitude is going to be the

02:04.170 --> 02:04.750
same.

02:04.890 --> 02:08.940
All right let me just go ahead and I'm got to save some room over here.

02:08.970 --> 02:16.170
I'm going to drag it all the way down here k q over our squared notice that the magnitude of each one

02:16.170 --> 02:16.830
is the same.

02:16.830 --> 02:18.850
Let me write that down.

02:19.380 --> 02:20.100
Magnitude

02:23.520 --> 02:25.630
is the same.

02:26.030 --> 02:26.310
All right.

02:26.310 --> 02:30.810
So now what we have to do is we really want to find what the total electric field looks like.

02:30.810 --> 02:34.100
So what you have to do is you have to add those up as vectors.

02:34.680 --> 02:40.460
So at the end what we're really interested in is the total field as a vector.

02:40.590 --> 02:48.300
So this here has to be equal to the field number one is a vector plus the field produced by the negative

02:48.300 --> 02:51.070
charge as a vector.

02:51.070 --> 02:51.320
OK.

02:51.330 --> 02:53.340
Call this E two.

02:53.370 --> 02:53.550
All right.

02:53.550 --> 02:58.500
So how would we add these as vector as well again I could just take the first vector and then I have

02:58.500 --> 03:02.030
to add the second one to it the second one is this guy right here.

03:02.130 --> 03:07.980
All you do is you simply take this vector and you translate it and now the resulting vector is going

03:07.980 --> 03:09.890
to be this one.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.840
This is the total electric field.

03:13.170 --> 03:18.660
At least the direction the magnitude we'd have to do a little bit of math in order to find that and

03:18.660 --> 03:21.280
I'll do that in just a few minutes.

03:21.320 --> 03:21.650
OK.

03:21.900 --> 03:27.250
But this is how you would find the direction so you could go back now and look at my diagram here which

03:27.300 --> 03:31.830
shows you the direction the electric feel that every point you could see that at any point here along

03:32.670 --> 03:38.900
the center the field is always pointing toward the right.

03:38.910 --> 03:43.950
It doesn't matter which point you take because it doesn't matter if I move my point p up above over

03:43.950 --> 03:44.360
here.

03:44.430 --> 03:47.870
These vectors are always going to have the same length.

03:47.910 --> 03:51.440
All right let's try a different point let's try a point like right over here.

03:51.660 --> 03:55.920
So over here we're gonna have two electric fields right there is the field produced by the positive

03:55.920 --> 04:00.210
one and the field produced by the negative on the field from the positive one points away.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.430
So let me go ahead and draw.

04:02.220 --> 04:03.380
Let me try to straighten that out.

04:03.390 --> 04:05.820
Draw a vector over here that looks like this.

04:06.270 --> 04:11.980
This would be the vector produced by the or the fourth the field produced by this positive charge.

04:12.000 --> 04:12.360
All right.

04:12.360 --> 04:17.880
In the distance I would use in this case and go ahead and kind of just delete this for now.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.770
Clean it up.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.880
The distance that I would be interested in here would be this one.

04:23.700 --> 04:27.150
This would be the distance that I would use here for this particular position.

04:27.150 --> 04:31.920
So this would be my AR and I'm going to call it our positive because now they're not going to be the

04:31.920 --> 04:37.740
same because you could see the distance from the negative charge all the way to this point p is pretty

04:37.740 --> 04:39.870
far all right.

04:39.870 --> 04:45.670
So how would I go ahead now and draw the vector produced by the negative charge at this point.

04:45.690 --> 04:47.490
Again I would probably draw like this.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.920
And now look what I'm doing over here right.

04:49.920 --> 04:54.470
This is the vector the electric field vector produced by the negative charge.

04:54.510 --> 04:56.310
What do you see what I did over here.

04:56.340 --> 05:03.030
Notice how short that vector is and that vector is going to be shorter because well think about the

05:03.060 --> 05:08.520
distance we're gonna have now the distance we're going to be using for this particular case is going

05:08.520 --> 05:10.360
to be this distance right here.

05:10.450 --> 05:14.250
It's going to go from here all the way to here.

05:14.250 --> 05:16.950
This will be the distance are minus.

05:16.980 --> 05:21.290
So again the total field is still the vector sum however.

05:21.310 --> 05:21.930
Okay.

05:22.020 --> 05:27.300
Since the blue vector is shorter than the red one the total electric field at the end should look something

05:27.300 --> 05:29.850
like this.

05:30.630 --> 05:34.590
You notice it is still a vector that points away from the positive.

05:34.590 --> 05:41.100
So if I go back to my diagram you could see on this side the vector still points away from the positive.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.910
But it's going to be small.

05:44.040 --> 05:50.710
All right then if you go on the other side for example the other side I could place a point P over here.

05:50.730 --> 05:52.410
Here you're going to have the exact opposite.

05:52.440 --> 05:52.640
Right.

05:52.650 --> 05:59.160
We have the field produced by the negative charge which is going to be a larger vector because it's

05:59.160 --> 06:01.420
closer to the negative charge.

06:01.710 --> 06:05.100
And then we also have the field produced by the positive charge in this case.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.710
This is gonna be the shortest one.

06:08.010 --> 06:11.010
So I've got the ones in twos mixed up over here.

06:11.010 --> 06:16.560
Let me just write it like this and this is the field produced by the positive charge.

06:16.560 --> 06:22.170
So again when you add both of these vectors up what you end up doing here is you're going to get a total

06:22.170 --> 06:23.580
vector like this.

06:23.610 --> 06:28.610
This is gonna be the total vector at least the direction you can see that from the diagram.

06:28.620 --> 06:34.860
When I'm on the right of this negative charge I have all the vectors pointing toward it.

06:34.890 --> 06:37.020
Now if you want to take any other direction you can.

06:37.020 --> 06:42.170
You could take this one for example ohm or you could take out of this one for example.

06:42.180 --> 06:45.350
Let's take this one since I have less things on my diagram over here.

06:45.470 --> 06:49.980
So I want to clean up some some things over here give myself some space.

06:49.980 --> 06:53.090
So how would it look like at any general point down here.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.280
Well let me take this one for example.

06:56.370 --> 07:01.680
So I have a positive charge that produces an electric field that points away from it.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.670
Notice I'm pretty close to this positive charge so I'm going to draw kind of a long vector.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.680
And then what else do I have.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.060
I have a negative charge which produces a vector.

07:11.060 --> 07:14.930
Now you've got an imaginary line that joins the negative charge to the point.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.690
And I'm gonna make that vector shorter.

07:18.690 --> 07:20.920
So it's going to look something like this.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.890
So I and what you have to do is you have to add those up as.

07:23.910 --> 07:30.150
So you do e one or the red vector plus the blue vector.

07:30.240 --> 07:34.200
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to move the blue vector down over here because I want to add

07:34.200 --> 07:39.970
them up and the total electric field at this point.

07:40.120 --> 07:45.750
Now if I didn't do it to right should look something like this it's a little bit on an angle over here

07:45.760 --> 07:50.580
again I'm just kind of guessing the magnitudes but if I guess wrong you could see I get it right.

07:50.580 --> 07:54.990
But over in general it's kind of pointing down and the angle will kind of depend here.

07:54.990 --> 07:55.240
Right.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.360
It kind of depends on how you've drawn those vectors.

07:58.440 --> 08:03.930
See if I'm just far enough it's going to point a little bit that side if I'm just closer on this side

08:03.930 --> 08:05.230
it points a little bit here.

08:05.260 --> 08:05.580
OK.

08:06.420 --> 08:10.520
But in this case the way I drew them this would be my total electric field.

08:11.200 --> 08:11.810
OK.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.360
We're going to take a numerical example in just a minute.

08:14.370 --> 08:18.280
But just getting in a general idea of why you get this field map.

08:18.480 --> 08:24.420
You just have to use the superposition adding the vectors the electric fields produced by each charge.
