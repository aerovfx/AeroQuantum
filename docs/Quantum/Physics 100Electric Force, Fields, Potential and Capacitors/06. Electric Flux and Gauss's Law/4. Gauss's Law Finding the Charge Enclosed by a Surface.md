# Gauss's Law Finding the Charge Enclosed by a Surface

## 06. Electric Flux and Gauss's Law

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy here's goes log in and my red box which says that the thông lượng through a close mặt equals to the total điện tích enclosed by that mặt divided by this hằng số which is our primitive city of free space. I Bây giờ just want to focus specifically Bây giờ on how do you actually evaluate this thing. Because this is just a hằng số. Vậy if chúng ta có thể evaluate the charging closed by any close mặt then we already done the Đúng hand side of GAUSS LAW and that makes our job a little bit easier. Vậy let's work on this term. Vậy what I've got over here are some point các điện tích that I've laid out in space. They have different magnitudes Vậy I have to highlight some of these Đúng. Vậy you have two columns over here. You got five cool homes there. Negative for cool homes over here and negative one cool home Đúng over here. Được rồi. Vậy they're all point các điện tích and let me look at some various surfaces. What if I had a mặt that looked something like this. Doesn't matter on the shape as long as it is close. I'm going to call this here mặt S1. Vậy how do you tính toán the thông lượng through this closed mặt Đúng here. OK. If I look at the mặt S1 the thông lượng through the close mặt again the total thông lượng through the close mặt. All I have to do is count how many các điện tích are inside Trong trường hợp này it's simply two columns. Vậy it'd be two divided by epsilon 0. That's it. That is the total thông lượng through that mặt which is kind of remarkable. Đúng. Because if you think about what the điện trường looks like that's produced by this điện tích over here it's in this hướng over here it's in this hướng. Được rồi. And the area is constantly changing Đúng the area for this kind of bent mặt over here is always in different directions. Đúng. The hướng perpendicular to this mặt looks like this. It's always changing. But what makes Gauss is law quite remarkable is that it's really easy to evaluate the thông lượng through any close mặt. Vậy let me kind of remove some of those just the clean up the picture a little bit. What's remarkable is even if I changed the mặt Whoops let's keep that like that over Epsilon 0. OK Vậy that's the thông lượng through that mặt. Even if I tried this mặt over here let me add a different mặt in a different color. What if I chose this mặt Đúng here again kind of rather complicated looking mặt and not really a rectangle because of what's going on over here. However I am in closing the same amount of điện tích as one. Vậy if I looked at the thông lượng going through this mặt over here if I did that calculation out long I would find the exact same answer. It's a closed service. Number one and định nghĩa the thông lượng through a close mặt. You simply have to evaluate the Đúng hand side. Vậy it would be two divided by epsilon 0 Được rồi. What if I take this mặt down over here let's clean up my picture a little bit. Được rồi let's do another mặt maybe do this one in purple. Here's another mặt Được rồi. First of all it is a closed service. You could see let's call this one here S3. Được rồi and what is the thông lượng through this close mặt. Or how much điện tích is enclosed. Again all you have to do is look inside this service. I have the total charging closed is what it's negative four and negative 1. Vậy I get minus five. Cool arm is the total charging close. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the thông lượng going through that total mặt would simply be equal to negative five over Epsilon zero. Notice I can have a negative value for the thông lượng there is nothing telling me that I can't go. And that is because there's gonna be field lines going toward all of these negative các điện tích. OK. Vậy this is the thông lượng through the mặt as 3 as do another one. What if I circle all of these các điện tích I make a giant mặt over here let's call this mặt. As for how much điện tích is enclosed through this mặt the amount of charging close they're all enclosed Đúng. I have to tổng every single điện tích over here Vậy it's basically Q1 plus Q2 plus Q3 plus Q4 to plus 5 is 7 and 7 minus 5 gives me too. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the thông lượng through S4 that's a close mặt. I can evaluate it by simply doing the total charging closed divided by epsilon 0. Được. That's the value of the thông lượng through the mặt. Let me show you another mặt over here what if I had a green mặt that looks something like this. Được rồi this let's call the green one here is mặt S5. Được rồi mặt S5. What is the total thông lượng going through that mặt again rather complicated mặt. Được rồi the area would always be perpendicular the field would be the field produced by all of these four point các điện tích which itself would be very very complicated because I'd have to evaluate that everywhere on the mặt. However Gauss law makes this really really simple. Vậy first of all how much Chargers enclosed by this mặt. I just look inside inside that mặt. There is zero charging close. Vậy what is the thông lượng going through S5 Gauss as law would tell us they would have to be 0 0 divided by epsilon 0 is still 0. Được. Hopefully you are a little bit more comfortable Bây giờ looking at this điện tích enclosed by a mặt. We're gonna go back Bây giờ and rather than doing these more complicated surfaces Bây giờ we're gonna do something that is a little bit friendlier is a little bit more symmetric and then we're gonna see how chúng ta có thể use it to actually evaluate the điện trường because remember điện trường is kind of buried in here. Được rồi you use always you always use điện trường to tính toán the thông lượng Vậy maybe we could use a friendlier mặt and use that quantity to actually tính toán the điện trường.
