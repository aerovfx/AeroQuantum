00:00.050 --> 00:00.260
All right.

00:00.270 --> 00:06.840
So here's goes log in and my red box which says that the flux through a close surface equals to the

00:06.840 --> 00:13.680
total charge enclosed by that surface divided by this constant which is our primitive city of free space.

00:13.680 --> 00:19.310
I now just want to focus specifically now on how do you actually evaluate this thing.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.540
Because this is just a constant.

00:21.540 --> 00:30.300
So if we can evaluate the charging closed by any close surface then we already done the right hand side

00:30.300 --> 00:33.000
of GAUSS LAW and that makes our job a little bit easier.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.030
So let's work on this term.

00:35.070 --> 00:39.350
So what I've got over here are some point charges that I've laid out in space.

00:39.390 --> 00:43.550
They have different magnitudes so I have to highlight some of these right.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.930
So you have two columns over here.

00:45.930 --> 00:48.480
You got five cool homes there.

00:48.750 --> 00:54.360
Negative for cool homes over here and negative one cool home right over here.

00:54.360 --> 00:54.570
All right.

00:54.600 --> 00:59.350
So they're all point charges and let me look at some various surfaces.

00:59.790 --> 01:03.060
What if I had a surface that looked something like this.

01:03.060 --> 01:06.930
Doesn't matter on the shape as long as it is close.

01:06.970 --> 01:10.070
I'm going to call this here surface S1.

01:10.470 --> 01:17.380
So how do you calculate the flux through this closed surface right here.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.050
OK.

01:18.270 --> 01:26.910
If I look at the surface S1 the flux through the close surface again the total flux through the close

01:26.910 --> 01:27.690
surface.

01:27.690 --> 01:34.740
All I have to do is count how many charges are inside in this case it's simply two columns.

01:34.890 --> 01:38.760
So it'd be two divided by epsilon 0.

01:38.790 --> 01:39.210
That's it.

01:39.210 --> 01:43.430
That is the total flux through that surface which is kind of remarkable.

01:43.430 --> 01:43.960
Right.

01:44.010 --> 01:48.960
Because if you think about what the electric field looks like that's produced by this charge over here

01:48.960 --> 01:55.110
it's in this direction over here it's in this direction.

01:55.110 --> 01:55.320
All right.

01:55.320 --> 02:01.530
And the area is constantly changing right the area for this kind of bent surface over here is always

02:01.530 --> 02:03.330
in different directions.

02:03.420 --> 02:03.630
Right.

02:03.630 --> 02:11.070
The direction perpendicular to this surface looks like this.

02:11.070 --> 02:12.420
It's always changing.

02:12.420 --> 02:18.630
But what makes Gauss is law quite remarkable is that it's really easy to evaluate the flux through any

02:18.630 --> 02:21.030
close surface.

02:21.030 --> 02:25.190
So let me kind of remove some of those just the clean up the picture a little bit.

02:25.200 --> 02:32.310
What's remarkable is even if I changed the surface Whoops let's keep that like that over Epsilon 0.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.150
OK so that's the flux through that surface.

02:36.150 --> 02:41.310
Even if I tried this surface over here let me add a different surface in a different color.

02:41.460 --> 02:43.920
What if I chose this surface right here

02:46.900 --> 02:51.280
again kind of rather complicated looking surface and not really a rectangle because of what's going

02:51.280 --> 02:52.140
on over here.

02:52.150 --> 02:56.850
However I am in closing the same amount of charge as one.

02:57.340 --> 03:03.070
So if I looked at the flux going through this surface over here if I did that calculation out long I

03:03.070 --> 03:05.130
would find the exact same answer.

03:05.140 --> 03:06.370
It's a closed service.

03:06.370 --> 03:09.970
Number one and define the flux through a close surface.

03:09.970 --> 03:12.900
You simply have to evaluate the right hand side.

03:12.910 --> 03:17.290
So it would be two divided by epsilon 0 all right.

03:17.320 --> 03:24.180
What if I take this surface down over here let's clean up my picture a little bit.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.180
All right let's do another surface maybe do this one in purple.

03:27.580 --> 03:28.930
Here's another surface

03:36.400 --> 03:36.610
All right.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.740
First of all it is a closed service.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.960
You could see let's call this one here S3.

03:42.370 --> 03:45.100
All right and what is the flux through this close surface.

03:45.130 --> 03:47.720
Or how much charge is enclosed.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.790
Again all you have to do is look inside this service.

03:50.800 --> 03:52.990
I have the total charging closed

03:55.890 --> 04:01.780
is what it's negative four and negative 1.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.520
So I get minus five.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.080
Cool arm is the total charging close.

04:06.180 --> 04:13.500
So that means that the flux going through that total surface would simply be equal to negative five

04:14.460 --> 04:15.930
over Epsilon zero.

04:15.930 --> 04:20.900
Notice I can have a negative value for the flux there is nothing telling me that I can't go.

04:21.160 --> 04:27.180
And that is because there's gonna be field lines going toward all of these negative charges.

04:27.600 --> 04:27.900
OK.

04:27.930 --> 04:33.540
So this is the flux through the surface as 3 as do another one.

04:33.570 --> 04:37.200
What if I circle all of these charges

04:39.910 --> 04:42.760
I make a giant surface over here let's call this surface.

04:42.760 --> 04:50.460
As for how much charge is enclosed through this surface the amount of charging close they're all enclosed

04:50.480 --> 04:50.650
right.

04:50.680 --> 04:59.290
I have to sum every single charge over here so it's basically Q1 plus Q2 plus Q3 plus Q4

05:01.990 --> 05:10.620
to plus 5 is 7 and 7 minus 5 gives me too.

05:10.730 --> 05:15.950
So that means that the flux through S4 that's a close surface.

05:15.950 --> 05:21.320
I can evaluate it by simply doing the total charging closed divided by epsilon 0.

05:21.380 --> 05:21.740
Okay.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.330
That's the value of the flux through the surface.

05:25.340 --> 05:30.260
Let me show you another surface over here what if I had a green surface that looks something like this.

05:33.450 --> 05:38.620
All right this let's call the green one here is surface S5.

05:38.660 --> 05:40.200
All right surface S5.

05:40.230 --> 05:45.020
What is the total flux going through that surface again rather complicated surface.

05:45.020 --> 05:50.880
All right the area would always be perpendicular the field would be the field produced by all of these

05:50.880 --> 05:56.610
four point charges which itself would be very very complicated because I'd have to evaluate that everywhere

05:56.610 --> 05:58.040
on the surface.

05:58.080 --> 06:01.250
However Gauss law makes this really really simple.

06:01.280 --> 06:07.260
So first of all how much Chargers enclosed by this surface.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.730
I just look inside inside that surface.

06:09.810 --> 06:12.660
There is zero charging close.

06:12.780 --> 06:19.920
So what is the flux going through S5 Gauss as law would tell us they would have to be 0 0 divided by

06:19.920 --> 06:22.480
epsilon 0 is still 0.

06:22.500 --> 06:22.730
Okay.

06:22.740 --> 06:28.960
Hopefully you are a little bit more comfortable now looking at this charge enclosed by a surface.

06:28.980 --> 06:34.500
We're gonna go back now and rather than doing these more complicated surfaces now we're gonna do something

06:34.500 --> 06:40.560
that is a little bit friendlier is a little bit more symmetric and then we're gonna see how we can use

06:40.560 --> 06:45.920
it to actually evaluate the electric field because remember electric field is kind of buried in here.

06:46.100 --> 06:53.160
All right you use always you always use electric field to calculate the flux so maybe we could use a

06:53.160 --> 06:57.750
friendlier surface and use that quantity to actually calculate the electric field.
