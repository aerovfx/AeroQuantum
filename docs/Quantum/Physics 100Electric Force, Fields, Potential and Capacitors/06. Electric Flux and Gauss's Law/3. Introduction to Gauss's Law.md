# Introduction to Gauss's Law

## 06. Electric Flux and Gauss's Law

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi Bây giờ I want to talk about GAUSS LAW. Vậy goes his law is super important. Vậy let's see why we would use Gauss his law Gauss his law is allows us to tính toán the thông lượng in a different way OK as opposed versus using the field multiplied by the area times cos of the angle theta. We just saw that version give us another way of doing it. That's what GAUSS LAW is going to do. The thing goes his law also allows us to do is can be used just write this down to tính toán Q electric fields which is kind of cool. OK we're gonna look at a couple of cases. This case however though is really only in some cases you can use it to tính toán electric fields only for really like symmetric objects. Được rồi we'll going to look at which cases you can use. Gauss is a lot of tính toán the điện trường. Vậy let me go ahead and định nghĩa what Gauss is law is. The other thing that we're going to need to do is we're going to need to uses close surfaces closed surfaces only Vậy you can't use open surfaces like the case we just saw before. OK. Vậy let me just highlight that. Không open surfaces Được rồi. Let's write down what Gauss is law is it simply says that the thông lượng the electric thông lượng just the way we know it. However it's through a closed loops through a close mặt the electric thông lượng going through any closed mặt is equal to the amount of điện tích inside that mặt divided by epsilon 0. And again this here was simply the permitted city of free space. That was our number that we used before Đúng. The eight point eight five times tend to the negative twelve. And this is just the total điện tích. Đúng. Total điện tích. However it has enclosed here Vậy it's really the total điện tích inside my mặt. This is not obvious. It's actually a really remarkable result. Vậy we're gonna go look at a couple of cases we want to use it for really symmetric objects Vậy symmetric objects is we're going to use it for a point các điện tích that's pretty symmetric. We're gonna use it for lines of điện tích and also for kind of 2D planes. Those are all very symmetric objects. OK. Vậy chúng ta có thể actually định nghĩa close services. Look at how much điện tích is inside and then actually use this to find the điện trường produced by each one of these three objects. Vậy let's go on the next page Bây giờ and focus a little bit more on both of these terms is Vậy chúng ta có thể practice. OK. Because there's really two sides through Gauss is law there's a left hand side is calculating the thông lượng through close surfaces and then there is evaluating the Đúng hand side which is looking at the enclosed điện tích. OK Vậy let's go look at both of these different sides of Gauss law and how we would evaluate it.
