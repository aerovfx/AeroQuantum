00:00.190 --> 00:02.580
So let's have a look at these three cases over here.

00:02.580 --> 00:10.690
First of all it's just Remen of our definition for ELECTRIC FLUX e a coasts of our angle theta.

00:10.770 --> 00:11.010
All right.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.470
Again here we have an open surface

00:16.560 --> 00:19.500
and the area is given by the letter A.

00:19.530 --> 00:25.440
Again if it was a square you could simply multiply the length times the width to get what the area is.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.800
NOW LOOK AT THE ELECTRIC FIELD MY ELECTRIC FIELD here points from the left to the right hand side again.

00:30.800 --> 00:36.890
All right points like this and it's uniform you could see that those field lines are evenly distributed.

00:36.890 --> 00:38.760
That's how I know it's uniform.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.690
So again now the area vector the area of vector if this is the plane.

00:43.950 --> 00:48.800
Again the area of vector here would point like this so that there would be perpendicular to the plane.

00:48.810 --> 00:50.680
You could see that here.

00:50.700 --> 00:56.040
So if you apply this definition here that means that the angle between the area or the vector that's

00:56.040 --> 01:04.030
perpendicular to the plane and my electric field in this case the angle theta is zero degrees if you

01:04.030 --> 01:12.880
substitute zero in my electric flux definition what you end up getting here is simply e multiplied by

01:12.880 --> 01:13.570
the area.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.180
OK.

01:14.260 --> 01:16.490
This is the maximum.

01:16.900 --> 01:18.420
FYI I can get.

01:18.420 --> 01:18.600
OK.

01:18.610 --> 01:21.490
That's the maximum flux.

01:22.210 --> 01:26.290
You get the most number of field lines that actually cross that area.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.200
If you have any other angle.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.040
OK.

01:29.070 --> 01:32.440
If we have any other angle that means that we have to use our definition.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.230
So I hear they use the letter 5 but let's just substituted here for theta.

01:36.340 --> 01:41.140
So you can see here that this angle over here right here is my area.

01:41.140 --> 01:48.640
That's kind of tilted a little bit and the dash line represents the line that is perpendicular to that

01:48.640 --> 01:49.360
surface.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.380
So look like this.

01:50.380 --> 01:52.700
This line perpendicular to the surface.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.780
And again it makes an angle theta.

01:55.090 --> 01:59.210
And my electric field again it points from left to right.

01:59.230 --> 02:01.150
And it's uniform.

02:01.150 --> 02:06.430
So again if you would draw both of those vectors you would have e that looks something like this.

02:06.430 --> 02:13.090
I would have my line that is necessary the vector that's perpendicular to the surface that looks like

02:13.090 --> 02:14.190
this.

02:14.370 --> 02:19.190
And the magnitude would simply be the area and then the angle would be theta.

02:19.200 --> 02:19.760
All right.

02:19.840 --> 02:26.400
So if you apply the definition you have to have all three terms here inside this flux definition.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.770
Okay.

02:27.910 --> 02:28.150
All right.

02:28.150 --> 02:32.080
In the case that's actually really really important is the last one over here.

02:32.140 --> 02:35.310
Look what happens when my area is flat.

02:35.320 --> 02:40.960
The vector that is perpendicular to the plane in this case is drawn a little bit to the side here but

02:40.990 --> 02:44.410
it's perpendicular to the surface.

02:44.710 --> 02:49.870
In this case look at my electric field is the same as all of those previous cases and the points from

02:49.870 --> 02:50.860
left to right.

02:50.980 --> 02:54.130
And it's constant uniform in space.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.510
So in this case here if you substitute everything inside my electric flux definition which you end up

03:01.510 --> 03:08.050
getting here is that the flux is given by this the angle between this black vector which is pointing

03:08.140 --> 03:14.680
up the black vector which is pointing straight up in this case and the electric field which is in this

03:14.680 --> 03:21.160
direction here is the vector that's perpendicular to the surface the magnitude is the area you could

03:21.160 --> 03:28.780
see that this angle Phi is 90 degrees in this case if you substitute 90 degrees in my flux equation

03:29.140 --> 03:34.420
what you end up getting is that the electric flux in this case is zero right.

03:34.420 --> 03:42.790
So we go from a maximum when you have the angle equals to zero to a flux equals a minimum value you

03:42.790 --> 03:50.020
could see that having the area down here in the plane there are no field lines that cross that area.

03:50.020 --> 03:53.110
So we say that the electric flux here is zero.
