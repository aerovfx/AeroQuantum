WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:00.530
All right.

00:00.540 --> 00:07.470
I now want to use Gauss as law in order to look at the look more at this left hand side of Gauss is

00:07.470 --> 00:07.670
law.

00:07.680 --> 00:12.470
Because what it can do is it can be used in order to calculate the electric field.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.500
OK but really only first symmetric objects.

00:15.500 --> 00:18.200
So let me switch this around.

00:18.450 --> 00:27.360
So for highly symmetric objects we're gonna use it to calculate the electric field.

00:27.480 --> 00:30.680
So one symmetric object is a single point charge.

00:30.720 --> 00:36.380
We know that the electric field produced by a single point charge at a distance are away from it.

00:36.390 --> 00:42.090
For example if I take this point over here if this is a positive charge we know that the field points

00:42.090 --> 00:43.290
like this.

00:43.440 --> 00:49.110
And if it's let me just write this down this would be the distance are the magnitude of the electric

00:49.110 --> 00:55.500
field would be like this k q over our squared we're QS the charge number our constant K is one over

00:55.500 --> 00:57.580
for Pi Epsilon zero.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.540
All right so that's the result that we know.

00:59.540 --> 01:04.900
Well what if I wanted to use Gauss as law in order to evaluate this.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.650
So first of all we're going to introduce this concept of a Goshen surface.

01:09.780 --> 01:17.730
So again it's a simply a closed surface because we want to evaluate a closed surface because we want

01:17.730 --> 01:20.160
to look at this side of Gauss as law.

01:20.160 --> 01:26.820
So let me look at a close surface and the surface should have the same symmetry as the object.

01:27.220 --> 01:31.960
So same symmetry as object.

01:33.240 --> 01:37.830
So if you imagine a point charge a point charges kind of like a small sphere.

01:37.830 --> 01:43.250
So you're Goshen surface should also have a spiritual symmetry.

01:43.450 --> 01:43.770
All right.

01:43.770 --> 01:48.310
This is my Goshen surface this a surface.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.240
It's a closed surface.

01:50.370 --> 01:50.920
So right.

01:50.930 --> 01:56.780
It's a closed surface it's kind of like a sphere around this charge actually so the flux through this

01:56.780 --> 02:00.550
surface is simply Q divided by epsilon 0.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.610
That's what I know right.

02:02.630 --> 02:05.180
And actually what if I drew a bigger one right.

02:05.210 --> 02:12.940
What if instead if I drew a bigger surface which is also a circle here's another surface.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.690
This other surface here has a different radius.

02:16.690 --> 02:16.880
Right.

02:16.880 --> 02:22.930
This is the radius say are to the blue one here might have a radius are 1.

02:23.390 --> 02:28.910
What can you tell me about the flux for the first surface.

02:28.910 --> 02:32.750
The blue one versus the flux going through the second one.

02:32.750 --> 02:36.890
Well if you look at Gauss is law if you look at the right hand side of Gauss is law you could see right

02:36.890 --> 02:43.380
away that the flux has to be the same because both of these surfaces enclose the same amount of charge.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.200
And in both cases you simply have q divided by epsilon 0 doesn't matter which one you pick.

02:49.020 --> 02:49.310
OK.

02:49.340 --> 02:54.670
So let's just pick the blue one because it really doesn't matter which one I pick.

02:54.680 --> 02:54.890
All right.

02:54.890 --> 03:01.130
If I pick the blue one over here I want to now evaluate what is this side of Gauss law.

03:01.370 --> 03:03.630
What's the left hand side of Gauss law.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.850
So this is what it looks like.

03:04.850 --> 03:08.720
So we're gonna work on spiritual objects first

03:11.730 --> 03:14.910
for spherical objects.

03:14.970 --> 03:18.240
How would we evaluate this flux over here.

03:18.240 --> 03:25.190
Well again for constant electric fields we had this we had a course of theta.

03:25.200 --> 03:29.190
So what if I say let's look at the angle theta.

03:29.190 --> 03:30.800
First of all what is this term.

03:30.960 --> 03:36.830
Again everywhere the electric field on this sphere should be pointing away from the charge.

03:36.840 --> 03:42.040
That's what we know doesn't matter which point you pick should be pointing away.

03:42.060 --> 03:43.800
What about the area vector right.

03:43.820 --> 03:50.600
Our area vector if I consider a little patch of area this one should be perpendicular to the surface.

03:50.640 --> 03:56.870
If I pick another one right here you should see that it is perpendicular to the surface.

03:56.910 --> 03:59.720
This one here is perpendicular to the surface.

03:59.760 --> 04:05.720
You can see that everywhere you look the angle theta is really equal to zero everywhere.

04:07.870 --> 04:11.590
So that's kind of important because that will simplify our calculation.

04:11.620 --> 04:16.750
So for this term I'm not even going to worry about it because everywhere for this object we have theta

04:16.780 --> 04:19.510
equals the Zero all right.

04:19.710 --> 04:26.370
Let's look at the area now really to get the total flux is you really have to go everywhere on the surface

04:26.730 --> 04:31.010
and you really have to add up all of the different contributions here.

04:31.410 --> 04:36.780
I don't want to get too much into the calculus here but actually for a spherical object which is what

04:36.780 --> 04:44.940
we're focusing on in this particular case all you really have to know is what is the area of the sphere.

04:44.940 --> 04:50.370
Because the field is going to be the same magnitude everywhere on this sphere.

04:50.370 --> 04:50.610
Right.

04:50.640 --> 05:04.850
So this is same magnitude and it's only the same magnitude because Magna tude it's the same magnitude.

05:04.850 --> 05:11.690
It's only the same magnitude because we have in a spiritual surface that's always the same distance

05:11.690 --> 05:14.990
away from from the charge.

05:14.990 --> 05:15.260
All right.

05:15.290 --> 05:20.660
So every time you're dealing with a spherical object this term basically is always the same.

05:21.170 --> 05:24.770
So it's the magnitude of the field multiplied by the area.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.860
So what is the area of a sphere.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.730
Now it's not the volume of a sphere.

05:29.840 --> 05:35.510
You might remember the volume of a sphere being as four thirds pi our cube.

05:35.590 --> 05:37.870
But that's volume.

05:38.060 --> 05:39.070
What about the area.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.400
This one you might not know.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.150
Okay.

05:41.450 --> 05:42.560
The area here.

05:43.100 --> 05:53.860
Let's just do it in green the area of a sphere is equal to for pi r squared and r is the radius.

05:53.860 --> 05:58.550
So in this case here if the radius is r 1 you'd be r 1 squared.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.050
Okay.

05:59.200 --> 06:04.790
So this is super important for anything that is spherical in shape.

06:05.380 --> 06:07.860
So let's go ahead now and write this down for Gauss is law.

06:07.870 --> 06:09.970
So the left hand side of Gauss is law.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.490
It's always going to be the same.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.310
It's gonna be my field is a constant everywhere.

06:15.370 --> 06:20.020
Again it's only the magnitude here we don't have to worry about the direction and the total area of

06:20.020 --> 06:24.640
my spherical surface is for Pi our squared.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.970
Now that has to be equal to the other side of Gauss is law.

06:27.970 --> 06:28.610
All right.

06:28.720 --> 06:32.560
The right hand side of Gauss is law which we said it's right here.

06:32.560 --> 06:37.630
It's the total charging closed divided by epsilon 0.

06:37.780 --> 06:40.510
So at the end you can see that you have electric field right here.

06:40.540 --> 06:43.160
So I can actually use this to find the electric field.

06:43.210 --> 06:47.090
All I do is I bring this whole term in the bracket down at the bottom.

06:47.320 --> 06:50.960
And if you do that you get my final expression for the electric field.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.350
It's going to be one.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.660
I'll just regroup some of the terms I get a four pi.

06:56.140 --> 07:04.260
I'll put the Epsilon 0 with the 4 pi and then here I'm left with Q divided by.

07:04.330 --> 07:06.890
In this case it's R one squared.

07:07.230 --> 07:08.160
And that's OK.

07:08.230 --> 07:16.690
Are one squared is its R one because that's how I define the radius of the surface.

07:17.100 --> 07:22.200
So it tells me that the field everywhere on the surface which is a distance are one away from the point

07:22.200 --> 07:24.950
charge is given by this.

07:25.080 --> 07:35.750
This is the same as the previous expression that we had for the electric field produced by point charges.

07:35.890 --> 07:38.010
Okay so we can actually use Gauss as law.

07:38.010 --> 07:41.140
Now we're gonna work now more on different shapes.

07:41.140 --> 07:47.850
All right we're gonna work on more spherical symmetric objects but let's have a look at how we evaluate

07:47.880 --> 07:50.940
this left hand side of Gauss is law for different shapes.
