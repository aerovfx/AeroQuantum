00:00.410 --> 00:02.750
All right now I want to talk about GAUSS LAW.

00:02.760 --> 00:05.410
So goes his law is super important.

00:05.500 --> 00:15.360
So let's see why we would use Gauss his law Gauss his law is allows us to calculate the flux

00:21.180 --> 00:29.760
in a different way OK as opposed versus using the field multiplied by the area times cos of the angle

00:29.760 --> 00:30.110
theta.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.120
We just saw that version give us another way of doing it.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.460
That's what GAUSS LAW is going to do.

00:35.460 --> 00:40.440
The thing goes his law also allows us to do is can be used

00:43.080 --> 00:46.430
just write this down to calculate

00:49.690 --> 00:54.980
Q electric fields which is kind of cool.

00:54.970 --> 00:57.230
OK we're gonna look at a couple of cases.

00:57.370 --> 01:04.630
This case however though is really only in some cases you can use it to calculate electric fields only

01:04.630 --> 01:08.980
for really like symmetric objects.

01:08.980 --> 01:11.240
All right we'll going to look at which cases you can use.

01:11.410 --> 01:13.750
Gauss is a lot of calculate the electric field.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.270
So let me go ahead and define what Gauss is law is.

01:18.160 --> 01:26.500
The other thing that we're going to need to do is we're going to need to uses close surfaces closed

01:27.310 --> 01:28.450
surfaces only

01:32.260 --> 01:36.280
so you can't use open surfaces like the case we just saw before.

01:36.280 --> 01:36.690
OK.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.470
So let me just highlight that.

01:38.470 --> 01:40.300
No open surfaces

01:46.430 --> 01:46.660
all right.

01:46.660 --> 01:51.670
Let's write down what Gauss is law is it simply says that the flux the electric flux just the way we

01:51.670 --> 01:52.380
know it.

01:52.900 --> 01:58.990
However it's through a closed loops through a close surface

02:04.140 --> 02:12.480
the electric flux going through any closed surface is equal to the amount of charge inside that surface

02:12.870 --> 02:15.020
divided by epsilon 0.

02:15.030 --> 02:21.810
And again this here was simply the permitted city of free space.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.870
That was our number that we used before right.

02:25.030 --> 02:27.870
The eight point eight five times tend to the negative twelve.

02:28.090 --> 02:30.130
And this is just the total charge.

02:30.130 --> 02:32.110
Right.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.310
Total charge.

02:33.310 --> 02:41.740
However it has enclosed here so it's really the total charge inside my surface.

02:41.740 --> 02:43.370
This is not obvious.

02:43.420 --> 02:46.180
It's actually a really remarkable result.

02:46.780 --> 02:54.250
So we're gonna go look at a couple of cases we want to use it for really symmetric objects so symmetric

02:54.280 --> 03:01.390
objects is we're going to use it for a point charges that's pretty symmetric.

03:02.110 --> 03:12.270
We're gonna use it for lines of charge and also for kind of 2D planes.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.830
Those are all very symmetric objects.

03:14.860 --> 03:15.090
OK.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.750
So we can actually define close services.

03:17.800 --> 03:23.680
Look at how much charge is inside and then actually use this to find the electric field produced by

03:23.680 --> 03:25.420
each one of these three objects.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.740
So let's go on the next page now and focus a little bit more on both of these terms is so we can practice.

03:30.810 --> 03:31.220
OK.

03:31.330 --> 03:37.720
Because there's really two sides through Gauss is law there's a left hand side is calculating the flux

03:37.720 --> 03:43.030
through close surfaces and then there is evaluating the right hand side which is looking at the enclosed

03:43.030 --> 03:44.060
charge.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.660
OK so let's go look at both of these different sides of Gauss law and how we would evaluate it.
