# Gauss's Law - Sphere with a Uniform Charge Distribution

## 06. Electric Flux and Gauss's Law

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. I Bây giờ want to apply Gauss his law to a slightly more complicated object. Again we're going to choose a spherical symmetric object Trong trường hợp này here is not going to be a chất dẫn điện it will be an chất cách điện. And imagine I have a ball and I've uniformly spread out điện tích inside the ball. OK Vậy here I've illustrated over here The ball has a certain radius which I'm calling uppercase R and it does have a total điện tích which could be anything. Five columns 10 cool homes it doesn't matter but that điện tích is not just on the mặt like a chất dẫn điện. It's uniformly distributed. OK. Vậy how would we actually apply Gauss is low. Vậy Trong trường hợp này there's two different limits that you have to look at. OK we're first going to focus on the field outside this ball and then we're going to see well điều gì xảy ra nếu I was inside the ball what would the điện trường look like inside the ball. OK Vậy let's look at both of these cases and how we apply Gauss as law. First of all the left hand side of Gauss is law which has the field in the area. This case is always the same for spherical symmetric objects. The only thing that's going to be different Bây giờ will be how much các điện tích enclosed. OK Vậy let's look at it you'll see what I mean. Đúng. Vậy my first case is when I'm outside điều đó có nghĩa là that I want to evaluate it at a point that is outside of this object. Vậy in that case it becomes pretty similar to what we previously did you choose a gaussian mặt that has the same symmetry as my object. Vậy it will be a hình cầu and its radius is little. Được rồi Trong trường hợp này again this total object here all of the điện tích that I've highlighted in orange has a total điện tích uppercase Q Vậy let's imagine we're going to evaluate Gauss as law for this object. Vậy the total charging close is just uppercase Q And that's divided by epsilon 0. That's the total thông lượng going through this blue mặt. Vậy how would you evaluate the field Bây giờ. Again the left hand side of Gauss is lost simply the độ lớn of the field multiplied by the area in the area that I'm interested in is always the area of my closed mặt. Đúng. It's always the close mặt over here that we're interested in. Vậy this here would be for PI and R bình phương. That is the area of a spherical object. Vậy at the end the điện trường is simply q over for Pi ask let's say sorry Epsilon 0. Multiply by our bình phương. Được. This is the same result as chúng ta có before 1 over for pie Epsilon zero K Q over our bình phương Đúng. When you're on the outside of this object it behaves again just like a point điện tích you get the same field as though you would have just a simple point điện tích and you were evaluating at some khoảng cách are away Đúng this here is a khoảng cách are between here and here and I was evaluating the field that point P I could Đúng away just simply write down this expression Đúng. Vậy outside it behaves very very similarly to our previous results what makes this problem a little bit more complicated Bây giờ is to evaluate the field inside. Được Vậy let's look at this Bây giờ. Được rồi. Bây giờ I want to look at the case where I'm evaluating the điện trường at some point inside this spherical object. Được rồi Vậy let's write down Gauss is log in we're going to have our Gaussian mặt which is here the Goshen mặt again has a little radius r and it's a spherical object Vậy the left hand side of Gauss is law. Always the same the độ lớn of the field multiplied by the total area of my spherical object. Vậy this has to be equal to the enclosed điện tích divided by epsilon 0. The question is how much điện tích do I actually have inside this blue mặt I don't have the total điện tích. Q I should have a fraction of it Đúng. Vậy the total điện tích again it has a uniform điện tích density over here. Vậy you imagine here you have a uniform điện tích density the điện tích density typically for a volume you can write the điện tích density as being the letter row and that should be the total điện tích divided by the total volume of the object that I'm looking at. Vậy the total v total is while it's a spherical object. Vậy this would be four thirds pi r cube and notice I'm using uppercase Q because that's the điện tích density. Được rồi. Vậy how do I find how much điện tích is inside this other volume. Well it's gonna we're gonna call this the charging closed and close this simply going to be the điện tích density multiplied by the volume enclosed by that mặt. Vậy that B What's the density what's the volume in close what's the volume of my blue hình cầu over here. Again it's for third pi little r cube Đúng. Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ you have to kind of substitute in what's our điện tích density our điện tích density is total điện tích divided by four thirds pi our cube and multiply by the term up here for third pi it's a different RB a little bit careful over here. This is the volume of the blues. And down here in the denominator is the total volume of my object. Được. chúng ta có thể simplify some of these the four thirds pi leave. And Bây giờ I actually have a nice expression for my điện tích that's enclosed. Được rồi. The total điện tích and it's a little our cube divided by big our cube. Được rồi we're gonna go ahead Bây giờ and substitute that in my expression for the total điện tích. The total điện tích enclosed by my mặt Vậy it looks like this. This is little our cube divided by big our cube and I still have the Epsilon 0 over here and here let's just leave this term unchanged for Bây giờ. I notice there's some simplifications chúng ta có thể make Không one look at I have our bình phương over here and I have our cube over here I could get rid of two of those and if I get rid of two of those I'm gonna be left with one up there. OK. Vậy what does this mean. Well that last expression that I get Bây giờ is you're gonna get one over for Pi Epsilon zero group those terms together the total điện tích q here I have multiplied by R and this is divided by our cube. Được Vậy I have a look this expression is actually quite different from the previous case it tells me that the field actually gets bigger. Vậy look at a couple of cases điều gì xảy ra nếu little R equals to zero. Vậy what if what is the điện trường Đúng here at the center of the hình cầu. If a little R equals zero notice what we get we get that equals to zero because there is Không điện tích inside a Goshen mặt my mặt is really really small. Take the limit Bây giờ điều gì xảy ra nếu the little radius goes all the way to the edge of my object. Vậy that would look something like this if that was the case what would be the điện trường. Vậy a little R I would substitute by uppercase R and then you would get what you'd get the same expression that I previously had. This would be Q and this would be divided by our bình phương. This looks just like a point điện tích again. The only time when it's different is when you're inside the object. When you're inside it actually looks significantly different. It has this dependence over here. Vậy if you were going to make a sketch of what the field looks like as a function of khoảng cách let me go ahead and kind of do that on the next page. Let me scroll down and let's plot both of these expressions. Vậy what I want to do Bây giờ is I want to make a plot of the điện trường độ lớn as a function of the khoảng cách are. And one thing we saw that when R equals to this I have some value. If you go back to the expression chúng ta có that on the inside. Let's scroll up here for a second on the inside look at what it looks like. All of this thing here is a hằng số and it's basically linear and R Vậy an R gets bigger the field gets bigger. Vậy let me go ahead and make a line that's this is a straight line. And the value Đúng here will be 1 over for Pi Epsilon zero Q over our bình phương as I'm on the outside number on the outside. The dependence is actually something the fuel actually gets smaller as I get farther away from it. Vậy the feel when I'm really really far away. The điện trường is really small. Vậy what you would say over here is that in this area over here the field is proportional to the khoảng cách and as over in this section over here the điện trường is proportional to one over the khoảng cách bình phương. Just like a point điện tích up here over here it's significantly different it's not like a point điện tích Đúng. The field depends linearly on the khoảng cách. Được rồi kind of a nice problem it doesn't get any harder than that four point các điện tích. Just make sure when you read problems you differentiate between insulating insulating spherical objects and conducting Đúng because a chất dẫn điện is significantly different. Remember our chất dẫn điện Bây giờ would look like this our chất dẫn điện would have E equals to zero inside for a chất dẫn điện because all the các điện tích at the mặt and then you would have this dependence here for a chất dẫn điện the same as the case we just dealt with Được rồi. Hopefully that makes sense to you.
