00:00.230 --> 00:05.940
All right let's do an example here where we're going to apply Gauss as law and I have a spherical conductor

00:06.460 --> 00:11.860
this physical conductor has a radius of 10 centimeters or point 1 meters as shown in the figure.

00:11.970 --> 00:18.330
And imagine I wanted to now apply Gauss his law to find the electric field at a distance away from the

00:18.330 --> 00:22.630
surface equal to 10 centimeters away from the surface of the conductor.

00:22.650 --> 00:27.100
How would I use Gauss his law in order to solve this problem.

00:27.170 --> 00:28.500
Okay so let's think about it.

00:28.500 --> 00:32.940
We got to evaluate the left hand side of Gauss is law in the right hand side.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.790
We have to place a surface around the object that I want to evaluate it and the surface should have

00:38.790 --> 00:40.680
the same symmetry as the object.

00:41.010 --> 00:44.600
Okay let me show you how to do this problem.

00:44.760 --> 00:49.620
All right step number one for Gauss this law is we need to place a Goshen surface somewhere.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.600
This is a spherical object.

00:51.600 --> 00:58.730
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to trace out a Goshen surface that is also a spherical object.

00:58.740 --> 01:01.830
Now this Goshen surface has a different radius all right.

01:01.830 --> 01:08.640
It's going to have a radius Little R which in this case is going to be equal to zero point two meters.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.530
All right I have a close surface.

01:10.530 --> 01:17.750
Now I can right away think about evaluating both sides of Gauss as law.

01:17.760 --> 01:18.000
All right.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.820
First of all we have this charge here and I've placed five micro Coolum on it.

01:23.910 --> 01:27.400
Now the keyword here is that this is a conductor.

01:27.480 --> 01:29.760
So what do you know about conductors.

01:29.760 --> 01:36.630
First of all you should remember that for conductors the electric field inside a conductor must be equal

01:36.630 --> 01:38.280
to zero.

01:38.430 --> 01:49.090
So that means that this charge over here has to be all on the surface of the conductor.

01:49.100 --> 01:54.830
Let me just keep on drawing a couple more charges so all of the charges for conductor is the net charge

01:54.860 --> 01:57.360
ends up being on the surface.

01:57.440 --> 02:01.330
So let's go now and evaluate are GAUSS LAW.

02:01.380 --> 02:03.470
Let's start here with the right hand side.

02:03.470 --> 02:06.470
How much charge is enclosed by this green surface.

02:07.310 --> 02:09.670
Well again cue total.

02:09.960 --> 02:10.940
It's this guy.

02:10.940 --> 02:15.850
This is five micro Coolum it's going to be spread out on the surface of this conductor.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.540
So this guy over here is simply five micro COOL.

02:18.590 --> 02:24.620
THAT'S FIVE TIMES 10 TO THE NEGATIVE six columns divided by my Epsilon zero.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.850
That's it.

02:26.900 --> 02:27.160
All right.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.720
Now we have to work on this side of GAUSS LAW.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.640
WELL THIS IS MY FIELD multiplied by the area.

02:33.650 --> 02:36.840
What is the area for this green surface over here.

02:36.860 --> 02:44.210
It's going to be for Pi the radius is Little R R squared and that's it.

02:44.210 --> 02:44.420
Right.

02:44.420 --> 02:47.960
This is because we have a spherical surface

02:52.980 --> 02:55.920
all right at the end all we have to do is bring that term in the bracket here.

02:55.920 --> 03:01.650
Down at the bottom and you get that the electric field really again it looks like the same expression

03:01.650 --> 03:01.830
now.

03:01.860 --> 03:04.590
We've always had a four point charges.

03:04.590 --> 03:06.890
This is just cue the total charge.

03:07.080 --> 03:15.540
Let's just call it upper Q. I'm sorry our five micro Coolum divided by r squared is a little R squared.

03:15.540 --> 03:15.900
That's it.

03:15.930 --> 03:19.890
Now you substitute in all the values and you can actually get what the magnitude is.

03:19.980 --> 03:27.480
So you get five times tend to the negative six you get four pi you get Epsilon zero and then you get

03:27.600 --> 03:31.770
actually instead of four pi Epsilon zero it's actually a little bit easier just to write it in terms

03:31.770 --> 03:37.710
of my k constant k constant was nine times tend to the nine.

03:37.830 --> 03:38.460
All right.

03:38.460 --> 03:44.130
And then divided by our squared in this case it's going to be zero point two meters squared.

03:44.150 --> 03:48.310
So let me go ahead and evaluate that using my calculator.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.380
So just bear with me for one second.

03:51.450 --> 03:57.780
So this time's nine each of the nine times five E to the negative six.

03:57.810 --> 03:58.020
All right.

03:58.020 --> 04:07.850
At the end of the day I get an electric field that equals a one point one two five times ten to one

04:07.850 --> 04:11.440
two three four five six tend to the six.

04:11.640 --> 04:17.250
And that should be in units of again as different units for electric field but I like Newton's cool.

04:17.640 --> 04:17.990
OK.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.740
So that's the magnitude of the electric field anywhere on this green surface.

04:22.740 --> 04:22.980
OK.

04:23.010 --> 04:26.440
This is how you would apply cool Ohm's Law.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.800
Sorry.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.260
That you would apply Gauss as law in order to solve this problem.

04:31.290 --> 04:31.710
OK.

04:31.860 --> 04:36.420
So remember when you're reading problems and you read the word conductor automatically you should know

04:36.420 --> 04:41.110
that the field inside the conductor is zero.

04:41.560 --> 04:46.200
That means that all of the surface ends up being on the surfaces of conductors.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.740
And this is how you would apply Gauss is a lot of this problem.

04:50.790 --> 04:57.690
You notice that the value that we get over here first physically symmetric objects even know this object

04:57.690 --> 04:59.950
here has a finite size it's a ball.

04:59.950 --> 05:01.230
Right.

05:01.380 --> 05:09.300
It behaves as though it's a point charge right behaves the same way behaves like a point charge

05:13.120 --> 05:16.470
where all of the charge would be concentrated right here at the center.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.790
And you're simply evaluating the distance.

05:18.880 --> 05:25.360
So that's true if you're outside if you're evaluating it on the outside of this spherical object.

05:25.360 --> 05:31.120
If I was evaluating the field on the inside I would have to get zero because it's a conductor.

05:31.120 --> 05:31.540
All right.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.080
Good job.
