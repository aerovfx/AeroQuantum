00:00.240 --> 00:00.470
All right.

00:00.500 --> 00:04.270
I now want to apply Gauss his law to a slightly more complicated object.

00:04.270 --> 00:11.040
Again we're going to choose a spherical symmetric object in this case here is not going to be a conductor

00:11.040 --> 00:12.430
it will be an insulator.

00:12.540 --> 00:18.720
And imagine I have a ball and I've uniformly spread out charge inside the ball.

00:18.720 --> 00:24.840
OK so here I've illustrated over here The ball has a certain radius which I'm calling uppercase R and

00:24.840 --> 00:27.320
it does have a total charge which could be anything.

00:27.380 --> 00:33.420
Five columns 10 cool homes it doesn't matter but that charge is not just on the surface like a conductor.

00:33.540 --> 00:35.660
It's uniformly distributed.

00:35.670 --> 00:35.890
OK.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.850
So how would we actually apply Gauss is low.

00:37.850 --> 00:41.310
So in this case there's two different limits that you have to look at.

00:41.340 --> 00:47.040
OK we're first going to focus on the field outside this ball and then we're going to see well what happens

00:47.040 --> 00:51.480
if I was inside the ball what would the electric field look like inside the ball.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.650
OK so let's look at both of these cases and how we apply Gauss as law.

00:55.650 --> 00:59.960
First of all the left hand side of Gauss is law which has the field in the area.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.490
This case is always the same for spherical symmetric objects.

01:04.530 --> 01:08.370
The only thing that's going to be different now will be how much charges enclosed.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.030
OK so let's look at it you'll see what I mean.

01:11.220 --> 01:11.480
Right.

01:11.490 --> 01:17.550
So my first case is when I'm outside that means that I want to evaluate it at a point that is outside

01:17.550 --> 01:18.630
of this object.

01:18.660 --> 01:24.480
So in that case it becomes pretty similar to what we previously did you choose a gaussian surface that

01:24.480 --> 01:26.370
has the same symmetry as my object.

01:26.370 --> 01:29.560
So it will be a sphere and its radius is little.

01:30.450 --> 01:36.000
All right in this case again this total object here all of the charge that I've highlighted in orange

01:36.360 --> 01:42.150
has a total charge uppercase Q So let's imagine we're going to evaluate Gauss as law for this object.

01:42.180 --> 01:47.690
So the total charging close is just uppercase Q And that's divided by epsilon 0.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.510
That's the total flux going through this blue surface.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.840
So how would you evaluate the field now.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.290
Again the left hand side of Gauss is lost simply the magnitude of the field multiplied by the area in

02:01.290 --> 02:05.970
the area that I'm interested in is always the area of my closed surface.

02:06.120 --> 02:06.400
Right.

02:06.420 --> 02:09.540
It's always the close surface over here that we're interested in.

02:09.570 --> 02:13.590
So this here would be for PI and R squared.

02:13.590 --> 02:17.430
That is the area of a spherical object.

02:17.550 --> 02:25.460
So at the end the electric field is simply q over for Pi ask let's say sorry Epsilon 0.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.600
Multiply by our squared.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.020
Okay.

02:28.140 --> 02:34.750
This is the same result as we have before 1 over for pie Epsilon zero K Q over our squared right.

02:34.980 --> 02:41.100
When you're on the outside of this object it behaves again just like a point charge you get the same

02:41.100 --> 02:47.430
field as though you would have just a simple point charge and you were evaluating at some distance are

02:47.430 --> 02:55.760
away right this here is a distance are between here and here and I was evaluating the field that point

02:55.760 --> 03:00.180
P I could right away just simply write down this expression right.

03:00.200 --> 03:05.390
So outside it behaves very very similarly to our previous results what makes this problem a little bit

03:05.540 --> 03:09.480
more complicated now is to evaluate the field inside.

03:09.570 --> 03:11.220
Okay so let's look at this now.

03:11.330 --> 03:11.600
All right.

03:11.640 --> 03:19.160
Now I want to look at the case where I'm evaluating the electric field at some point inside this spherical

03:19.160 --> 03:20.130
object.

03:20.210 --> 03:25.040
All right so let's write down Gauss is log in we're going to have our Gaussian surface which is here

03:25.300 --> 03:31.340
the Goshen surface again has a little radius r and it's a spherical object so the left hand side of

03:31.340 --> 03:32.590
Gauss is law.

03:32.600 --> 03:40.650
Always the same the magnitude of the field multiplied by the total area of my spherical object.

03:40.670 --> 03:45.640
So this has to be equal to the enclosed charge divided by epsilon 0.

03:45.650 --> 03:53.310
The question is how much charge do I actually have inside this blue surface I don't have the total charge.

03:53.310 --> 03:56.870
Q I should have a fraction of it right.

03:56.980 --> 04:02.160
So the total charge again it has a uniform charge density over here.

04:02.380 --> 04:11.170
So you imagine here you have a uniform charge density the charge density typically for a volume you

04:11.170 --> 04:18.010
can write the charge density as being the letter row and that should be the total charge divided by

04:18.010 --> 04:21.750
the total volume of the object that I'm looking at.

04:21.790 --> 04:27.760
So the total v total is while it's a spherical object.

04:27.780 --> 04:35.260
So this would be four thirds pi r cube and notice I'm using uppercase Q because that's the charge density.

04:37.270 --> 04:37.490
All right.

04:37.520 --> 04:42.410
So how do I find how much charge is inside this other volume.

04:42.410 --> 04:48.620
Well it's gonna we're gonna call this the charging closed and close this simply going to be the charge

04:48.620 --> 04:55.190
density multiplied by the volume enclosed by that surface.

04:55.190 --> 05:01.340
So that B What's the density what's the volume in close what's the volume of my blue sphere over here.

05:01.520 --> 05:06.830
Again it's for third pi little r cube right.

05:06.890 --> 05:07.120
All right.

05:07.130 --> 05:13.310
So now you have to kind of substitute in what's our charge density our charge density is total charge

05:13.880 --> 05:22.410
divided by four thirds pi our cube and multiply by the term up here for third pi it's a different RB

05:22.490 --> 05:24.110
a little bit careful over here.

05:24.350 --> 05:26.780
This is the volume of the blues.

05:27.320 --> 05:31.340
And down here in the denominator is the total volume of my object.

05:31.540 --> 05:31.810
Okay.

05:31.820 --> 05:35.060
We can simplify some of these the four thirds pi leave.

05:35.060 --> 05:39.830
And now I actually have a nice expression for my charge that's enclosed.

05:39.830 --> 05:40.120
All right.

05:40.160 --> 05:44.630
The total charge and it's a little our cube divided by big our cube.

05:44.630 --> 05:49.590
All right we're gonna go ahead now and substitute that in my expression for the total charge.

05:49.910 --> 05:54.330
The total charge enclosed by my surface so it looks like this.

05:54.410 --> 06:00.920
This is little our cube divided by big our cube and I still have the Epsilon 0 over here and here let's

06:00.920 --> 06:04.030
just leave this term unchanged for now.

06:04.410 --> 06:10.520
I notice there's some simplifications we can make no one look at I have our squared over here and I

06:10.520 --> 06:16.130
have our cube over here I could get rid of two of those and if I get rid of two of those I'm gonna be

06:16.130 --> 06:18.840
left with one up there.

06:18.860 --> 06:19.430
OK.

06:19.430 --> 06:21.350
So what does this mean.

06:21.350 --> 06:29.180
Well that last expression that I get now is you're gonna get one over for Pi Epsilon zero group those

06:29.180 --> 06:39.040
terms together the total charge q here I have multiplied by R and this is divided by our cube.

06:39.140 --> 06:47.030
Okay so I have a look this expression is actually quite different from the previous case it tells me

06:47.030 --> 06:49.700
that the field actually gets bigger.

06:49.940 --> 06:54.820
So look at a couple of cases what happens if little R equals to zero.

06:54.830 --> 06:59.170
So what if what is the electric field right here at the center of the sphere.

06:59.270 --> 07:07.310
If a little R equals zero notice what we get we get that equals to zero because there is no charge inside

07:07.310 --> 07:10.720
a Goshen surface my Surface is really really small.

07:10.910 --> 07:16.460
Take the limit now what happens if the little radius goes all the way to the edge of my object.

07:16.460 --> 07:20.870
So that would look something like this if that was the case what would be the electric field.

07:21.440 --> 07:27.560
So a little R I would substitute by uppercase R and then you would get what you'd get the same expression

07:27.560 --> 07:29.540
that I previously had.

07:29.750 --> 07:33.050
This would be Q and this would be divided by our squared.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.550
This looks just like a point charge again.

07:35.810 --> 07:40.080
The only time when it's different is when you're inside the object.

07:40.100 --> 07:43.970
When you're inside it actually looks significantly different.

07:43.970 --> 07:46.290
It has this dependence over here.

07:46.550 --> 07:51.680
So if you were going to make a sketch of what the field looks like as a function of distance let me

07:51.680 --> 07:54.350
go ahead and kind of do that on the next page.

07:54.470 --> 07:58.510
Let me scroll down and let's plot both of these expressions.

07:58.700 --> 08:06.830
So what I want to do now is I want to make a plot of the electric field magnitude as a function of the

08:06.830 --> 08:08.320
distance are.

08:08.540 --> 08:13.890
And one thing we saw that when R equals to this I have some value.

08:14.300 --> 08:18.920
If you go back to the expression we have that on the inside.

08:18.930 --> 08:22.560
Let's scroll up here for a second on the inside look at what it looks like.

08:22.670 --> 08:29.450
All of this thing here is a constant and it's basically linear and R so an R gets bigger the field gets

08:29.450 --> 08:30.720
bigger.

08:30.720 --> 08:34.480
So let me go ahead and make a line that's this is a straight line.

08:34.820 --> 08:45.830
And the value right here will be 1 over for Pi Epsilon zero Q over our squared as I'm on the outside

08:46.160 --> 08:47.660
number on the outside.

08:47.720 --> 08:53.560
The dependence is actually something the fuel actually gets smaller as I get farther away from it.

08:53.690 --> 08:55.810
So the feel when I'm really really far away.

08:55.810 --> 08:58.530
The electric field is really small.

08:58.670 --> 09:05.330
So what you would say over here is that in this area over here the field is proportional to the distance

09:06.320 --> 09:14.670
and as over in this section over here the electric field is proportional to one over the distance squared.

09:14.780 --> 09:19.850
Just like a point charge up here over here it's significantly different it's not like a point charge

09:19.850 --> 09:20.000
right.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.160
The field depends linearly on the distance.

09:25.000 --> 09:28.930
All right kind of a nice problem it doesn't get any harder than that four point charges.

09:29.060 --> 09:35.480
Just make sure when you read problems you differentiate between insulating insulating spherical objects

09:35.720 --> 09:39.370
and conducting right because a conductor is significantly different.

09:39.380 --> 09:45.500
Remember our conductor now would look like this our conductor would have E equals to zero inside for

09:45.500 --> 09:51.680
a conductor because all the charges at the surface and then you would have this dependence here for

09:51.680 --> 09:58.260
a conductor the same as the case we just dealt with all right.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.790
Hopefully that makes sense to you.
