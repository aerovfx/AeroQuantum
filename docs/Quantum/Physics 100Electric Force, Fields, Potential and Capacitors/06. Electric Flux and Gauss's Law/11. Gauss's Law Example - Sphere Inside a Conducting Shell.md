## 06. Electric Flux and Gauss's Law

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Hi everybody physics ninja here today. We're going to do is we're going to apply GAUSS LAW this phương trình Đúng over here which is the integral of the điện trường scalar tích with the area is equal to cuing closed over Epsilon 0 we're going to apply Gauss as law in order to find the điện trường everywhere in space and the geometry I'm considering here is the one shown in the figure. Vậy what chúng ta có here is a hình cầu at the center of a shell. OK Vậy the hình cầu the inner hình cầu has a radius a the outer shell has a thickness and the inner radius is B and the outer radius is C Vậy how would you solve for the điện trường everywhere in space. And what we're gonna do is we're going to xem xét two cases. OK Vậy case number one for this inner hình cầu I'm going to assume that it is a chất dẫn điện. OK. And again that inner shell or saw that inner hình cầu rather has a total điện tích equal to three Q The outer shell is has a total net điện tích of negative Q OK Vậy how would you set up GAUSS LAW to solve for the điện trường everywhere and for the second case what I'm going to do is I'm going to assume that this inner hình cầu is an chất cách điện and the điện tích is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of that hình cầu. OK. Vậy they've got two different cases. If it's insulating vs. conducting what is the hiệu. How do you set up Gauss is like what makes it different. OK Vậy Case 1 here is the case where we're going to assume that this inner hình cầu is conducting. Được. And my goal is định nghĩa the điện trường in Region 1 Vậy anywhere within this hình cầu. Vậy the first thing you do for Case 1 is if it's a conducting hình cầu. OK. This is a very very special word. If you hear that word conducting hình cầu it means by definition OK that the điện trường inside must be equal to zero. Well how is that possible. OK. The only way that it's possible from Gauss is law that you get zero. The only way that's possible is if the enclosed điện tích of my Goshen mặt also equals the zero. Vậy what điều đó có nghĩa là here is that this three Q must be spread out evenly on this spherical mặt. OK Vậy that's it. This is what's going to happen for a chất dẫn điện. You can't have any điện tích anywhere inside because that would tạo ra an điện trường and then điều đó có nghĩa là that the các điện tích would move because there'd be a lực tác dụng lên them. OK Vậy Case 1 is kind of just the definition that the field inside a chất dẫn điện must be zero. Vậy all of the điện tích is going to be on the outside. OK Bây giờ case 2 is a little bit more complicated Vậy for Case 2 what we're going to assume here is that the điện tích is going to be uniformly distributed throughout the entire volume here of Được rồi. We're gonna assume that it's uniformly distributed throughout the entire volume of the hình cầu. Được. Vậy what chúng ta có to do Bây giờ is you. Bây giờ you really have to apply GAUSS LAW FOR THIS. Vậy THE FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO IS again draw our Gaussian mặt. And that's again it's going to look like a hình cầu. Mine's a little bit rough looking that's OK and the hình cầu here has a certain radius. Let's call it radius little are like this. Được rồi. Vậy the question is how do you apply GAUSS LAW FOR THIS. Vậy SINCE THIS IS PHYSICALLY symmetric actually the left hand side of GAUSS LAW is always pretty straightforward. OK Vậy first of all to get rid of this integral the integral will simply simplify to something like this. It's the điện trường độ lớn multiplied by the mặt Đúng. And the reason that it simplifies is because again the điện trường produced by any amount of điện tích inside the hình cầu is going to be pointing straight out and the area is also Được rồi. If I look at the little bit of area of my hình cầu that's also a véctơ that points radiantly outward. Vậy what chúng ta cần to do Bây giờ is simply evaluate what is this total area of the hình cầu. And Trong trường hợp này it's simply for pi r square this is the công thức for the mặt of a hình cầu that has a radius are Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ you write down the rest of Gauss as law it's the charging close then this green mặt and divided by epsilon 0. Được rồi pretty straightforward. Bây giờ you have to use kind of your judgment here and try to evaluate how do we find how much điện tích is inside. Bây giờ it's not equal to three Q because three q is the total điện tích Vậy it's going to be a fraction of the total điện tích Đúng. If you think about how much các điện tích and close let's go ahead and write it down give my marker. Được rồi. Vậy chúng ta có q enclosed is really going to be a fraction of the total điện tích. Bây giờ what you could also do is you could định nghĩa a điện tích density which equals to the total điện tích divided by the total volume and then integrate over the volume. You really don't have to do that. You could just say it's going to be a volume fraction of the total điện tích. Vậy this is would be the total volume of this hình cầu which is for pi r cube. And in this way it's a cube. Đúng because the radius of the hình cầu is a. And Bây giờ how much volume is enclosed here in this green mặt. It would be again for thirds pi r cube. Được rồi well chúng ta có thể simplify this expression a little bit the four thirds cancel the PI cancel and my total điện tích is really three Q Vậy at the end this year simplifies to our cube multiplied by three Q I'll put the three in the front and divided by a cube. Được Vậy Bây giờ I'm just gonna put everything together Let me give myself a little bit of extra space here kind of shrink that down. Được Vậy Bây giờ we plug everything into Gauss law. Vậy again the left hand side was e multiplied by 4 pi r bình phương in the Đúng hand side was Q in close which is my expression here divided by epsilon 0. Vậy it's just 3 R cube big Q and divided by epsilon 0 a cube. Được we could simplify a few of the terms here. First of all you notice you have r bình phương here and you have our cube here which means you could get rid of two of them and get rid of the two appear you're still left with one. And at the end you just want one final expression for my điện trường độ lớn. Vậy I bring the four pi down to the bottom Vậy you get one over for Pi Epsilon zero. You kind of always have that term Đúng. And then let's look at all the terms that are left. 3 q is the điện tích Vậy that term is there and I still have divided by a cube. That's just the hằng số term. That's the radius of this hình cầu. And then at the end I can't forget this. R And this is really really important Đúng. Vậy this is it depends linearly with the khoảng cách away from the center. Vậy to kind of really different results. Đúng. If it's insulating and the điện tích is uniformly distributed this is what you get. And if it's a conducting hình cầu you would get zero. OK. All the way up until the mặt. Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ let's xem xét the second region. Vậy for Region 2 Bây giờ. Region 2 is in this white area. This white space between the hình cầu and that outer shell. And again what you first do is you draw your Goshen mặt somewhere within that white region. And my goal Bây giờ is to write down Gauss as law. Vậy again it's physically symmetric. Vậy the left hand side of Gauss is law basically always reduces to this for PI and the area of this hình cầu is for Pi are bình phương. OK. That was the left hand side of Gauss his law equals the Q and closed divided by my hằng số Epsilon 0. Vậy Bây giờ you ask yourself how much điện tích is enclosed by this shell or by this Gaussian mặt rather. And again if you have a look at the diagram how much các điện tích is close will all of this điện tích that is inside this inner hình cầu is enclosed Đúng. And whether it's conducting or whether it's insulating it really doesn't matter because that total điện tích was 3 q Được rồi. The only hiệu if it's conducting or insulating it's the way that the điện tích is spread out. But really this charging close is always 3 q Vậy I can just go ahead and write it down that's the total điện tích and closed divided by epsilon 0. Again just rewrite the left hand side of Gauss as law here and again bring the 4 pi are bình phương at the bottom and this is what we're left with. Total các điện tích 3 q divided by 4 pi Epsilon 0 multiplied or sorry divided by our bình phương like this. Được rồi Vậy this looks like a familiar expression Đúng. This looks like exactly the field produced by a point điện tích that would have a điện tích equal to three Q And that điện tích would all be concentrated at one point. Đúng. And if I'm a khoảng cách are away this would be the expression I would use to find the độ lớn of the field produced by that point điện tích. OK. Kind of a nice result from Gauss is law. Let's xem xét the third region Bây giờ. Vậy Region 3 Bây giờ is anywhere inside this outer shell. However in the statement of the problem I said something really really important. Được. I said that this outer shell is a chất dẫn điện. Được. And this is really really the key to this problem Đúng here. Vậy if it's a chất dẫn điện you should automatically know the field inside anywhere inside this the field inside the outer shell which is Đúng it is e subscript shell must be equal to zero it's a chất dẫn điện. Bây giờ if you think back of our Gauss is law we'll think about our Gauss is law. How would we get to zero. Đúng. How would we get zero for the điện trường in this region. Well let's write down Gauss is law the left hand side of Gauss is law would be if he multiplied by four pi are bình phương. Again this is as physically symmetric object. Vậy this is how it would look like in the area of my Gaussian mặt over here is for Pi our bình phương. Bây giờ this has to be equal to q in close divided by epsilon 0. But how do we get Q in closed for this problem. Well let's think about how much điện tích is enclosed here. Vậy chúng ta có charging close we definitely having closed all of this Đúng. Because my ocean mặt is out here and I have 3 Q Được but I do require this statement Đúng. How do I get zero điện trường the only way I can really have zero điện trường is if my Q closed must also be equal to zero. If queueing close the zero then automatically the field is going to be zero. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that there has to be some điện tích that has to go on this inner wall of the shell. And Bây giờ the question is how much điện tích goes on this inner wall. Well let's. chúng ta có to add it up because it's going to be enclosed by this Gaussian mặt. Vậy it's gonna be plus Q What is Đúng is inner wall. OK. Vậy at the end of the day we do require that the Q enclosed over here is equal to zero. And the only way you can have this because I do have the three each Q enclosed from this hình cầu. điều đó có nghĩa là that the inner wall Q inner wall must be opposite of whatever the total các điện tích from this hình cầu. Vậy at the end of the day I find that the only way I can have zero điện trường inside this chất dẫn điện is if the điện tích on this inner wall is equal to negative three. Q This is a requirement and this will ensure that the total điện tích enclosed is going to be zero. And that is going to lực that điện trường to also be zero. Được Vậy go ahead and write this Vậy. Q inner wall must be equal to negative 3. Q Được rồi Vậy this way you add negative 3 q to the plus three Q of the hình cầu and you're going to get zero total điện tích in closed. If I have zero total điện tích and closed I'm going to get zero điện trường anywhere in this region Vậy the next question chúng ta có to ask ourselves is well if this inner wall has negative three Q like we calculated here what about the outer wall. Đúng how much điện tích is actually on this mặt over here of that shell. And in order to answer that you simply have to look at the total điện tích of that chất dẫn điện in this problem I said that the total điện tích of the chất dẫn điện was negative. Q Được rồi. Vậy this is kind of oil it looks like. Đúng. Vậy cue total for the shell has to be equal to whatever is on the inner wall inner. I'll just write as Q inner plus whatever's on the outer wall. OK. And the total điện tích of the shell is given by this Không negative Q This is what we had this was negative Q we just solve for what was on this inner wall the inner wall we said was negative three Q Vậy plus q outer. Vậy at the end Bây giờ we just bring the negative three Q On the other side you're left with that the điện tích on the outer mặt điện tích on the outer mặt must be equal to to Q You have Không choice you have to have conservation of điện tích. Vậy if I put negative Q on here điều đó có nghĩa là that on the inner wall I'm going to get negative three Q And on the outer wall I have to have plus two. Q That's the only way that both of those are going to tổng up to equal to the total điện tích on the shell. Được because negative three plus two gives me negative 1 which is what I said in the problem statement and you have this distribution of điện tích because we do require that the field is equal to zero everywhere in this shell because it's a chất dẫn điện. Được rồi let's go on to the final region. OK Vậy this is Bây giờ region for what I've drawn is a ocean mặt that is on the outside because this is where I want to evaluate the field I want to evaluate it when the radius is bigger than C Vậy I want to be on the outside of that conducting shell Đúng again we apply Gauss is a lot of this problem we want to look at the field dotted with the area it's a spherical service Vậy the area of that hình cầu is for Pi our bình phương always the same thing for spherical symmetric objects. Được rồi. This must be equal to again how much điện tích is enclosed by that mặt divided by epsilon 0. Well Bây giờ let's look at what is Q and closed for this problem. Well number one I am enclosing this entire hình cầu Đúng. I definitely have all of that điện tích. Vậy if you go ahead and write this you have to have definitely plus three Q is enclosed by this Gaussian mặt what else. I am also enclosing all of the điện tích that is on the shell and all of the điện tích on the shell is well it's negative. Q Vậy at the end what I have is to Q This has to be the total điện tích enclosed by my Gaussian mặt Trong trường hợp này. Vậy we go ahead we substitute that into Gauss as law Vậy you get e for Pi are bình phương must be equal to to Q divided by epsilon 0 to get the final expression you just bring all of this term in the bracket here down in the denominator on the other side Vậy you'll get to Q divided by 4 pi Epsilon 0 and over our bình phương again if you look at this result this would be the result that you would get if you had a point điện tích and if the point điện tích was equal to 2 Q and I was a certain khoảng cách R away from that point điện tích Đúng. This is if I'm evaluating what is the field at this point I would get the exact same result. Được. And that's kind of obtained from Gauss is low this way. Vậy here's a summary of the results that we obtain let's try to make a sketch Bây giờ. Vậy for the region from what I'm plotting here is the độ lớn of the điện trường this just Đúng is E here on the y axis and I have the khoảng cách R on this x axis and let's draw the different cases. Vậy the first we're gonna do is well if it's a conducting hình cầu then you should have zero here. Bây giờ this other one is if it's insulating let me put it in a different color over here it should be a linear relationship and it should go all the way to the top over here. OK. Vậy the field grows as I get away from the khoảng cách could I end up being closing more điện tích. Được rồi. And let's do the second region the field is kind of the same it starts off in both cases appear and it rolls off as one over R bình phương Vậy it should look something like this over here. Đúng. Should roll off here and this is like a one over our bình phương dependence. Được rồi. And what about the next part. The region here in the shell between B and C. Vậy in that case that case is pretty easy to draw. It should just be zero because it's a chất dẫn điện. And in the last region again it should probably start at some value over here. It's going to be lower than this because I'm further out. And again it's gonna roll off as one over R bình phương. Again this is proportional to the khoảng cách bình phương. Được rồi this is kind of what it looks like again in these regions here you could have zero because it's a chất dẫn điện. And again it depends on the case here that I looked at but this is what a sketch would look like for this điện trường. Được rồi. Thanks for watching folks. Hopefully you understood it and you become a better problem solver.
