WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.070
So here we have a new problem here.

00:02.220 --> 00:07.860
Two point charges a five and eight micro Coolum other place inside the queue and they give us the dimensions

00:07.860 --> 00:09.110
of the queue.

00:09.150 --> 00:14.000
Question is what is the net ELECTRIC FLUX passing through the services of the cube.

00:14.000 --> 00:14.430
All right.

00:14.460 --> 00:20.960
So first thing I would do is kind of just imagine here we have our cube try to draw this in three dimensions

00:20.980 --> 00:23.490
Here's the sketch it out.

00:23.970 --> 00:26.690
If something like this and then I have my two charges right.

00:27.250 --> 00:31.320
Yeah this might look like they're not inside the cube depending on how I draw it but all right here

00:31.320 --> 00:38.350
we have the eight micro Coolum and the green one let's just say this is a five micro Coolum.

00:38.490 --> 00:38.730
OK.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.510
So what is the net electric flux.

00:40.510 --> 00:43.230
Well for this one here I would use Gauss as law.

00:43.230 --> 00:43.500
Right.

00:43.500 --> 00:50.810
And in order to find this because the flux member our equation and the net flux what you could do is

00:51.120 --> 00:58.590
if you were really ambitious you could actually calculate the E dot a for the total electric field passing

00:58.590 --> 01:02.490
through all of those services but that would be way too hard right.

01:02.520 --> 01:07.010
If you use Gauss is law it says that the net flux through a close surface.

01:07.110 --> 01:11.380
So I'm going to call this the close surface is the cube.

01:11.580 --> 01:17.160
One other way to calculate the net flux is just to use Gauss as law which says that the flux is equal

01:17.160 --> 01:24.480
to how much charge is enclosed by that surface and divided by our Epsilon 0 that permitted city of free

01:24.480 --> 01:25.790
space.

01:25.860 --> 01:31.500
So at the end all you need to do is find that the net flux through the surface is equal to how much

01:31.500 --> 01:35.540
charges and while both of these charges are inside.

01:35.550 --> 01:43.020
So that means that we have five micro cool plus eight micro cooling and all of this gets divided by

01:43.020 --> 01:45.300
our Epsilon 0 which is just a constant.

01:45.330 --> 01:50.200
So it's eight point eight five times 10 to the negative twelve.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.300
All right just be a little bit careful over here.

01:52.320 --> 01:57.330
This guy here converted into cool arms so get rid of that micro all right at the end what you end up

01:57.330 --> 02:01.730
getting here would be 13 times 10 to the negative six.

02:01.740 --> 02:08.100
That's what we get for micro cooling and divided by eight point eight five times ten to the negative

02:08.150 --> 02:08.680
12.

02:08.700 --> 02:13.710
All right you put that in the calculator you should get a choice C is the correct answer.

02:13.710 --> 02:14.040
All right.

02:14.460 --> 02:18.990
So this is just remember that Gauss is law even though it's a cube surface it doesn't matter.

02:19.110 --> 02:21.360
It goes as law still applies.

02:21.540 --> 02:25.890
The easiest way to find the total flux is to use Gauss as law.

02:25.890 --> 02:28.890
All right let's go scroll down to the next problem over here.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.410
Our next problem.

02:30.510 --> 02:32.880
Scroll down so you can see all the choices.

02:32.910 --> 02:33.110
All right.

02:33.120 --> 02:39.540
So we have a net electric field of a magnitude of this value over here and is directed along the positive

02:39.630 --> 02:40.800
x axis.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.170
All right so when you actually draw with that field looks like.

02:43.310 --> 02:47.460
So we have a field that looks like this and then it's constant.

02:47.460 --> 02:54.150
And the magnitude is six times 10 to the six Nunes curriculum.

02:54.210 --> 02:54.440
All right.

02:54.440 --> 03:00.900
They give us the length of the edge here of the cube this is zero point one and it's oriented like this.

03:00.900 --> 03:05.430
So it's really this is the surface that we are interested in here.

03:05.490 --> 03:05.820
All right.

03:05.850 --> 03:10.270
So what is the electric flux passing through the shaded area.

03:10.320 --> 03:10.520
All right.

03:10.530 --> 03:14.140
So this is really just applying our definition of electric flux.

03:14.280 --> 03:21.270
The definition of electric flux was the magnitude of the field multiplied by the magnitude of the area

03:21.740 --> 03:23.610
and multiplied by coast of theta.

03:23.610 --> 03:31.470
That is the angle between the electric field vector and the vector that is perpendicular to the surface.

03:31.470 --> 03:37.050
So in this case here the vector that is perpendicular to the surface is this vector over here.

03:37.050 --> 03:41.030
So both of those vectors are parallel to each other.

03:41.070 --> 03:43.590
So that means that our angle theta here should be zero.

03:44.370 --> 03:49.200
So really all we're doing here is just substituting our values six times ten of the six.

03:49.290 --> 03:53.540
And now the area since it's only a square surface.

03:53.820 --> 03:57.930
What you get is zero point one and you have to square that value.

03:57.930 --> 03:58.210
All right.

03:58.290 --> 04:04.820
So at the end what you end up getting here should be six times ten of the four.

04:05.080 --> 04:09.570
That's the kind of a best answer right here if you substitute that new calculator.

04:09.590 --> 04:09.770
All right.

04:09.780 --> 04:14.700
Here we have a thin spherical shell that has a radius of eight centimeters and this much charge seven

04:14.700 --> 04:16.480
point five micro columns.

04:16.560 --> 04:22.800
What is the electric field a couple different places for a one centimeter above the surface.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.030
All right.

04:23.060 --> 04:28.860
So let's go ahead and draw that one centimeter above the surface might be at this position over here.

04:28.900 --> 04:34.560
Actually it could be any position could be this one so it could be any position on this sphere and this

04:34.560 --> 04:43.520
is kind of not drawn to scale but this distance here would be one centimeter the radius.

04:43.530 --> 04:47.950
They tell us the radius again this is eight centimeters.

04:48.120 --> 04:48.750
OK.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.470
And we're also told how much charge there is on the surface.

04:51.480 --> 04:52.030
Right.

04:52.110 --> 04:57.750
The charge Q On the surface is seven point five times 10 to the negative six columns.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.420
OK so final electric field anywhere on the surface.

05:01.510 --> 05:05.790
This is a problem with spherical symmetry I would probably use Gauss as law.

05:05.810 --> 05:12.580
Right Gauss law says this that the total electric flux going through this blue surface over here is

05:12.580 --> 05:15.750
equal to the charging close by that surface.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.550
Multiply by epsilon zero.

05:17.920 --> 05:18.410
OK.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.830
And the amount of charging close in this case is simply the total charge.

05:21.820 --> 05:24.360
Q So it's Q divided by epsilon 0.

05:24.370 --> 05:26.560
That's the right hand side of Gauss is law.

05:26.770 --> 05:28.280
The left hand side of Gauss is low.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.890
Let's work on that over here.

05:29.950 --> 05:30.970
That's the flux.

05:31.030 --> 05:38.020
So that's going to be the magnitude of the field and multiplied by the area and the area for a sphere

05:38.020 --> 05:41.200
is for pi r squared.

05:41.240 --> 05:41.710
Okay.

05:42.010 --> 05:43.240
So here's what I'm looking for.

05:43.240 --> 05:51.250
So at the end the field is simply q over for Pi Epsilon zero and R squared.

05:51.250 --> 05:51.450
Okay.

05:51.460 --> 05:55.070
So Q we know is this what is our value for this one.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.520
Okay so that's really important.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.790
Our value remember we're looking at this.

05:58.930 --> 06:00.110
This guy right.

06:00.130 --> 06:02.950
This is the area of the blue sphere right.

06:02.950 --> 06:04.630
This is area.

06:04.790 --> 06:08.190
And so here would be nine centimeters.

06:08.250 --> 06:08.510
Okay.

06:08.530 --> 06:14.260
So areas really has to be calculated with the radius equals the nine centimeters because it's the area

06:14.260 --> 06:16.950
of the gaussian surface.

06:17.050 --> 06:17.350
All right.

06:17.380 --> 06:23.080
So at the end my electric field if you put in all the values again remember that one divided by four

06:23.080 --> 06:25.130
pi Epsilon 0 right here.

06:25.420 --> 06:33.280
This is the value K so that's mine nine times 10 to the 9 the value of the charges seven point five

06:34.510 --> 06:36.800
times 10 to the negative six.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.060
And what else.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.790
0 divided by our squared.

06:39.790 --> 06:43.470
So this would be nine centimeters zero point zero nine.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.140
And you have to square that value okay.

06:46.190 --> 06:51.700
At the end put that all on the calculator and you should get a value of eight point three multiplied

06:51.700 --> 06:55.980
times 10 to the six newtons per Coolum.

06:56.110 --> 06:56.320
Okay.

06:56.320 --> 07:01.070
That's just the magnitude of the field anywhere on that blue surface.

07:02.020 --> 07:02.260
All right.

07:02.260 --> 07:05.640
What about B B's a little bit easier actually.

07:05.740 --> 07:10.180
B They want to know at seven centimeters from the center of the sphere.

07:10.180 --> 07:10.490
Okay.

07:10.530 --> 07:14.320
Well let me kind of clean this up a little bit.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.960
Well let's just drawn near the surface.

07:15.970 --> 07:21.490
If you're seven centimeters from the surface you're going to be where you're going to be somewhere on

07:21.490 --> 07:22.770
the inside here.

07:22.790 --> 07:29.830
Right my ocean surface would look like this and the radius of this would be seven centimeters.

07:29.970 --> 07:30.220
Okay.

07:30.250 --> 07:35.740
Well if you think about this let's go back to Gauss as law goes his law says that this flux through

07:35.740 --> 07:44.170
that surface through my green surface this time is equal to Q closed divided by epsilon 0.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.190
Now think about this top term here.

07:46.270 --> 07:52.090
How much charge is enclosed by this green surface All right.

07:52.090 --> 07:53.030
Think about it for a minute.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.280
You should get zero.

07:54.280 --> 08:00.850
Right there should be zero charge because all of the charge is on this black surface right here.

08:00.850 --> 08:04.990
So if you get zero divided by epsilon zero at the end you get zero.

08:04.990 --> 08:07.590
If you think about the left hand side of Gauss is law.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.010
This is the field multiplied by the area.

08:11.500 --> 08:16.590
And the only way I can get zero here is if the electric field is also zero.

08:16.690 --> 08:23.050
So you have everywhere inside this sphere you're actually going to get zero electric field because there's

08:23.050 --> 08:26.450
no charge enclosed in that surface.

08:26.670 --> 08:27.160
OK.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.810
Kind of a nice guess his law problem.

08:28.990 --> 08:30.120
All right let's go to the next one.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.300
OK.

08:32.320 --> 08:38.200
Problem four says we have a metal sphere that has a radius of 10 centimeters of interest draw it again

08:40.630 --> 08:45.640
here's the radius r. This is 10 centimeters it has an excess charge again.

08:45.640 --> 08:49.800
So the Q on the charges to micro cooling.

08:49.870 --> 08:50.100
All right.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.360
And again that charge is all on the surface.

08:52.870 --> 08:57.420
So what's the magnitude of the electric field five centimeters above.

08:57.460 --> 08:57.670
All right.

08:57.670 --> 09:04.640
So if you count five centimeters above this might be where the field is in this distance here is five.

09:05.080 --> 09:08.410
So the distance from the center here would be 15.

09:08.410 --> 09:11.530
Now again you imagine you have a gaussian surface over here

09:14.440 --> 09:16.510
and the ocean surface has a radius

09:19.120 --> 09:21.450
equals the 15 centimeters.

09:21.690 --> 09:26.130
I'll just right here ocean surface radius equals zero point one five meters.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.300
That's 15 centimeters.

09:28.300 --> 09:28.510
All right.

09:28.510 --> 09:29.650
So Gauss is law again.

09:29.650 --> 09:34.900
That's all you have to use for this problem goes is law says that the flux through that surface is the

09:34.900 --> 09:38.680
field multiplied by the area.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.590
Always the same for anything that looks like a spherical geometry.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.160
This here has to be equal to Q enclosed.

09:46.210 --> 09:50.280
So how much charge would be enclosed by my red surface would be all of the charge.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.950
So that's Q divided by epsilon 0.

09:54.070 --> 09:54.740
Okay.

09:55.000 --> 10:02.620
At the end we get Q divided by four pi Epsilon 0 and divided by our squared.

10:02.870 --> 10:03.390
Okay.

10:03.520 --> 10:08.580
All we have to do now is substitute in all our values one over for Pi Epsilon zero.

10:08.590 --> 10:10.580
That's the K constant.

10:10.690 --> 10:20.380
Nine times ten of the nine Q is two micro columns tend to the negative six and divided by the radius

10:20.380 --> 10:24.960
of my Goshen surface zero point one five and square that thing.

10:25.210 --> 10:31.180
Okay at the end of the day if you plug that in your calculator you should get that the correct answer

10:31.180 --> 10:31.870
is B.

10:32.130 --> 10:35.420
Okay all right.

10:35.730 --> 10:40.100
That's it for that won't scroll down to the last problem for this problem set over here.

10:40.320 --> 10:41.020
Okay.

10:41.100 --> 10:49.350
Problem 5 looks like this says the figure shows for Gaussian surfaces surrounded by a distribution of

10:49.350 --> 10:50.100
charge.

10:50.170 --> 10:50.390
Okay.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.230
So the Gaussian surfaces are here.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.100
So here's let me choose a different color here here's Gaussian surface.

10:56.130 --> 10:59.160
A B C and D.

10:59.330 --> 11:00.170
Okay.

11:00.360 --> 11:10.200
Which Goshen surface surfaces have an electric flux equal to Q divided by epsilon 0.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.620
So this is for a.

11:12.930 --> 11:17.140
And the flux for this one is Q divided by epsilon 0.

11:17.160 --> 11:26.730
It's positive Q So all you have to do is simply find Well which one has a total charge of positive Q

11:26.730 --> 11:27.530
inside right.

11:27.540 --> 11:35.370
Because remember Gauss law is the flux is equal to Q enclosed by a surface divided by epsilon 0.

11:35.610 --> 11:43.190
Okay so we need to find a one of these surfaces so let's look at surface a surface a over here how many

11:43.890 --> 11:46.080
surface A's the big sphere.

11:46.260 --> 11:48.050
It actually encloses everything.

11:48.060 --> 11:48.630
So let's see.

11:48.630 --> 11:57.020
So that means that we have positive to Q We have minus Q And we have plus Q So the total charging close

11:57.030 --> 12:02.940
by this one over here is going to be positive to Q So that's not it.

12:02.970 --> 12:05.880
What about surface B surface.

12:05.880 --> 12:12.270
B Is this one that's kind of this ellipse soil over here and this one you get positive to q minus Q

12:12.500 --> 12:14.570
And that's it.

12:15.000 --> 12:20.740
So again for B it's everything that's enclosed by this surface right here.

12:21.810 --> 12:23.970
So that means we have positive q.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.770
Okay so that works.

12:25.770 --> 12:32.730
And what about C let's go do surface C surface C let's represented here by a different color.

12:32.730 --> 12:37.390
Do the green as a service C as of this one right here.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.170
So how much charge is in close.

12:39.170 --> 12:45.840
Well you have negative Q and positive Q This is zero.

12:46.230 --> 12:47.500
So zero.

12:47.740 --> 12:48.680
And the last one.

12:49.030 --> 12:50.770
Let's do it and read this here.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.770
B D D this one over here.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.910
Let's do it in red.

12:55.960 --> 13:00.210
So that's a lip sort over here only has a single charge in it.

13:00.700 --> 13:06.420
So it's negative Q So negative Q All right.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.840
Again this is not the flux this is this the total charge in close.

13:09.850 --> 13:14.990
This is Q enclosed by each one of those surfaces.

13:15.130 --> 13:21.580
So going back now which one here has a flux of plus q over e so for choice a over here it would have

13:21.580 --> 13:26.380
to be which surface surface B surface

13:29.420 --> 13:33.260
is be OK.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.600
What about B.

13:35.650 --> 13:36.930
Question B over here.

13:37.540 --> 13:38.860
Let's do it down over here.

13:38.860 --> 13:43.540
Which Gaussian surface have no electric flux through them.

13:43.540 --> 13:50.400
If there is no electric flux it means that there is no total charge inside all right that Q and closed

13:51.460 --> 13:52.720
divided by epsilon 0.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.870
If you have zero Q and closed then you're gonna have zero flux.

13:57.010 --> 14:05.070
So the only one that has zero charging close this surface C surface C and that's the correct answer

14:05.070 --> 14:06.890
for Choice B okay.

14:06.990 --> 14:07.530
And that's it.

14:07.530 --> 14:10.870
Right Gauss is law applied to this problem is pretty straightforward right.

14:10.950 --> 14:16.380
It doesn't matter on this complicated shape of the surface it's kind of the remarkable thing about Gauss

14:16.390 --> 14:19.440
is Lord only depends on how much charges and closed.
