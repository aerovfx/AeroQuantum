ALL RIGHT NOW I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED THE ELECTRIC FLUX.

00:03.570 --> 00:03.780
ALL RIGHT.

00:03.780 --> 00:06.480
THE ELECTRIC FLUX has a basic definition.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.690
We call it Fi and usually I put a little subscript E TO REMIND ME THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTRIC

00:12.690 --> 00:13.700
FLUX.

00:13.770 --> 00:18.740
First of all this is a scalar quantity so it's just the number.

00:18.780 --> 00:24.410
Having trouble here a scalar in it's defined in terms of two vectors.

00:24.440 --> 00:30.110
One of them is the electric field vector and it's a scalar product with an area vector.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.580
I'll get back to this in a minute.

00:31.590 --> 00:37.170
Let me just kind of write this down this here's a scalar product between two vectors

00:39.990 --> 00:46.080
if you want to write the scalar products slightly differently you can do it using just the definition

00:46.080 --> 00:49.660
of the scalar product and it ends up looking like the definition over here.

00:50.080 --> 00:56.700
OK so the flux is equal to the magnitude over here it's just the magnitude of the electric field.

00:56.820 --> 01:04.320
The magnitude of the area and theta here is actually the angle between the electric field and this area.

01:04.320 --> 01:09.120
So it's kind of a little bit of the talk about area in terms of a vector but let's do that in just a

01:09.120 --> 01:10.980
second here.

01:10.980 --> 01:17.310
You could see right here in the figure here that it's defined that if I have a square plate in this

01:17.310 --> 01:25.560
case if I take a direction that is perpendicular to the plane that's kind of what it says here.

01:25.890 --> 01:28.020
That is the direction of the area.

01:28.560 --> 01:34.890
So for example if I have a circular area here right here in the plane let me draw a set of coordinates

01:34.890 --> 01:36.590
just so we can kind of see something.

01:36.590 --> 01:42.300
So imagine this here was X Y and then that would make Z like in this direction.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.580
Okay.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.820
So the area for this particular circle.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.560
Well first of all I would have a particular radius.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.240
The magnitude of the area.

01:53.250 --> 01:58.060
How big is the area of that circle would be pi are squared.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.210
What about the direction.

01:59.220 --> 02:04.040
How would you define the direction of the area if I wanted to define it as a vector over here.

02:04.050 --> 02:10.230
Again you have to draw a vector that's perpendicular to the plane so perpendicular to the plane would

02:10.230 --> 02:11.310
be this direction.

02:11.310 --> 02:16.320
This would be the direction of the area and you could see right here at the perpendicular to the plane

02:16.320 --> 02:18.120
of that circle.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.900
So over here I would simply write it in the z direction.

02:22.040 --> 02:22.330
Okay.

02:22.360 --> 02:28.140
Knowing the direction is important because of this angle theta that angle theta is always the angle

02:28.140 --> 02:31.730
between the area of vector and the electric field vector right.

02:31.740 --> 02:34.810
You could see it right here in the figure.

02:35.130 --> 02:40.950
So the first definition I have here highlighted in green is for the case where you have a uniform electric

02:40.950 --> 02:41.620
field.

02:41.670 --> 02:47.920
In this case the electric field points from the left hand side all the way to the right hand side.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.670
And it's more or less constant everywhere.

02:51.960 --> 02:55.850
So the flux if you look at it it basically counts right.

02:55.880 --> 03:03.610
It's a number that is associated with the number of electric field lines that go through a certain surface.

03:03.660 --> 03:07.050
One more definition this here is actually an open surface.

03:07.050 --> 03:09.710
It's just one surface out in space.

03:09.720 --> 03:13.750
This is also an open surface.

03:14.070 --> 03:19.980
When we talk about something in the next lecture called Gauss is law we're gonna be interested in close

03:19.980 --> 03:27.300
surface a close surface would represent like a cube or a sphere for example something that has no holes

03:27.300 --> 03:34.410
in it that's completely closed an open surface would just represent one surface from a cube for example

03:35.130 --> 03:39.920
one of the walls of the cube that would represent an open surface All right.

03:39.930 --> 03:47.910
So this is our definition for electric flux and this is the case where E is uniform all we say is constant

03:47.910 --> 03:48.440
in space.

03:48.450 --> 03:51.180
So the definition is pretty straightforward.

03:51.240 --> 03:57.480
Now we've looked at point charges and maybe fields from wires or you're going to see later on fields

03:57.480 --> 04:01.530
from stacking a whole bunch of point charges on top of each other.

04:01.650 --> 04:05.970
In that case the field is not constant everywhere in space.

04:05.970 --> 04:06.210
All right.

04:06.210 --> 04:11.220
If you remember from point charges let's me just write it over here.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.620
Four point charge.

04:13.620 --> 04:21.150
My equation for the electric field a magnitude any way was k q divided by our squared and R was the

04:21.150 --> 04:23.520
distance from that point charge.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.570
You can see here that the field is not uniform.

04:26.570 --> 04:31.680
So actually the electric FLUX AND IF YOU WANTED TO CALCULATE THE ELECTRIC FLUX what you would need to

04:31.680 --> 04:35.890
do is really you'd have to integrate over the entire surface.

04:35.940 --> 04:41.310
So what you have to do is you have to take your surface and break it down into a whole bunch of smaller

04:41.310 --> 04:42.760
little slices.

04:43.260 --> 04:49.050
Each one of these little slices has an area and it also could have a direction right if that area is

04:49.050 --> 04:50.020
curved.

04:50.490 --> 04:55.020
It's a little bit more complicated to do it this way but if you're taking a calculus based course you

04:55.020 --> 04:56.270
might want to do this.

04:56.430 --> 05:01.500
We're gonna see later on when we're talk about GAUSS LAW THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME simplifications we're

05:01.500 --> 05:03.960
gonna use this second form of the equation.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.810
Let me highlight here here in a different color.

05:06.810 --> 05:11.970
We're gonna use this form of the equation but we're gonna simplify because there are cases where you

05:11.970 --> 05:14.030
can simplify this form of the equation.

05:14.120 --> 05:19.320
OK but you might see this one looks more complicated but really all you're doing is you're adding the

05:19.320 --> 05:26.190
electric flux due to each little area and you have to do this because the electric field is not uniform

05:26.220 --> 05:28.160
everywhere in space.

05:28.500 --> 05:28.710
All right.

05:28.710 --> 05:29.970
So we have two definitions.

05:30.030 --> 05:35.430
I want to go back to the case that I have highlighted in green here and look at this angle theta and

05:35.430 --> 05:36.540
a little bit more detail.
