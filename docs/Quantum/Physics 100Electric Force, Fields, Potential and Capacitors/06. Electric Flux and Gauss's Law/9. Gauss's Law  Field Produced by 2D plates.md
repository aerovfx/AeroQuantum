# Gauss's Law  Field Produced by 2D plates

## 06. Electric Flux and Gauss's Law

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Last geometry that I really want to look at is a 2D plate. Vậy again here's a 2D plate and again I'm going to assume that you have uniform điện tích distribution. Again this plate is assumed to be very very big Vậy although I've just drawn a little section of it it's really kind of really big and I'm looking at points that are pretty close to the plate. The way you write down the điện tích distribution typically fo$r^2$D objects instead of the điện tích per unit length like the line. Bây giờ I talk about the điện tích per unit area Vậy you would write the total điện tích divided by the total area. This we typically use the letters sigma for this. Here's kind of a side view Được rồi. Again I want to apply Gauss as lot of this object. Vậy chúng ta có to first định nghĩa a ocean mặt for this one here usually what people do here is usually like a little pillbox extends a little bit above. And then this will extend below the plate something like this. If I draw it down over here again the Goshen mặt would look like this and something like that Được. First thing to realize is that the field produced by 2D objects just like the line you're only going to have a field that points away from if it's positively charged. The field would have to point away from the 2D plate. It really doesn't make sense that there'd be any component over here that would be in the mặt phẳng of the 2D plate. Vậy this actually simplifies our thông lượng calculation because we don't have to worry about the thông lượng on the sides of this little tube over here. Không thông lượng THROUGH THIS mặt through through the sides just Đúng through sides. I think that hopefully makes sense to you and that's simply because the angle between the véctơ that's perpendicular. Được rồi here's my véctơ that is perpendicular and if the field's going up điều đó có nghĩa là that the angle over here would be 90 degrees. Vậy Không thông lượng THROUGH THE SIDES OF THIS SHAPE. Only thông lượng going through the top and the bottom. Được Vậy Bây giờ my little Goshen mặt over here has a tiny little area here at the top. And it has the same area at the bottom. And again the hướng Bây giờ for the area is. Again it's parallel to both Đúng. It's parallel to the điện trường over here and it's also parallel to the điện trường down here. Vậy let's first think about how much điện tích is actually inside this tiny little box over here. Được rồi. How much điện tích do chúng ta có. Well we only have a little bit of điện tích whatever điện tích is Đúng here Đúng. That's where the 2D plate intersects my shape. Vậy let's first look at this one. Vậy the charging closed again it's going to be the điện tích density Sigma and multiplied by the area that I'm considering over here. The area of my little box or the area of my hình trụ and that's it. That's the total charging closed. Vậy at the end we all chúng ta cần to do Bây giờ is look at how do we evaluate the left hand side of Gauss as low over here. Because the Đúng hand side is simply Sigma multiplied by the area divided by epsilon 0. Vậy for this one chúng ta cần to look at the thông lượng through the top and the thông lượng through the bottom. Again Không thông lượng through the sides. Vậy at the top again we just use our thông lượng calculator which is just the điện trường multiplied by the area. And then chúng ta có codes of zero degrees at the bottom chúng ta có the véctơ pointing away from the plate. Vậy chúng ta có e the areas the same. And we also have codes of zero degrees. And this here has to be Sigma a over Epsilon 0. We don't have to worry about the coast of 0 term that simply equals the one. And look at these two terms these two terms are the exact same Vậy you get two times E A equals the Sigma the same area divided by epsilon 0. Vậy one thing we notice here is that the area is actually on both sides. And all you have to do is bring the two down in the denominator and you're left with the final answer that the điện trường is simply Sigma my điện tích density divided by two Epsilon 0 Được rồi and that's it. That is the total điện trường. Notice that this field here is hằng số. Đúng doesn't depend on the khoảng cách. There is Không khoảng cách over here. Once you know the điện tích density of the plate that's at any point you evaluate that điện trường you're going to get the same value. Vậy let me go ahead and kind of draw this. Let's kind of remove this for a second. This was from the previous problem. Vậy let's see what all of this means. OK. Vậy imagine here I have a 2D plate and I'm just going to draw the side view. And here chúng ta có a certain điện tích density. điều đó có nghĩa là if I want to draw this điện trường I should let me change the color over here just Vậy chúng ta có thể kind of see this a little bit better. Được rồi. If I draw the điện trường điều đó có nghĩa là that the điện trường over here points away from the plate. The điện trường on this side points away from the plate and the điện trường is uniform. OK. Which means that the độ lớn of the field is simply Sigma divided by two Epsilon 0. It's also the same up here Sigma divided by two Epsilon 0. If I want to increase this value it really doesn't matter where you are Đúng whether you're at position 1 or whether you're at position 2 whether you're at position 3 the độ lớn of the field is always going to be the same. Bây giờ the differential sorry the hướng will be different Đúng. Between 1 and 3. But that's it. The độ lớn is going to be the same. If you had a 2D plate that was negatively charged. Được rồi. Vậy the điện tích density would be a negative sigma. Bây giờ the only hiệu would be that the field would be pointing toward it. But e is still hằng số and everywhere the field would simply be pointing toward that plate. There is Không component that is parallel to the plate. The field is always perpendicular to plates. Vậy that's how you would apply goes is law to this problem.
