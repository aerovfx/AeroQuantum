00:00.210 --> 00:04.220
Last geometry that I really want to look at is a 2D plate.

00:04.260 --> 00:10.370
So again here's a 2D plate and again I'm going to assume that you have uniform charge distribution.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.540
Again this plate is assumed to be very very big so although I've just drawn a little section of it it's

00:15.540 --> 00:19.830
really kind of really big and I'm looking at points that are pretty close to the plate.

00:20.040 --> 00:26.130
The way you write down the charge distribution typically for 2D objects instead of the charge per unit

00:26.130 --> 00:27.940
length like the line.

00:27.990 --> 00:33.600
Now I talk about the charge per unit area so you would write the total charge divided by the total area.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.770
This we typically use the letters sigma for this.

00:37.350 --> 00:39.270
Here's kind of a side view all right.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.890
Again I want to apply Gauss as lot of this object.

00:42.150 --> 00:47.670
So we have to first define a ocean surface for this one here usually what people do here is usually

00:47.670 --> 00:51.270
like a little pillbox extends a little bit above.

00:51.270 --> 00:56.570
And then this will extend below the plate something like this.

00:57.180 --> 01:04.800
If I draw it down over here again the Goshen surface would look like this and something like that okay.

01:04.890 --> 01:11.060
First thing to realize is that the field produced by 2D objects just like the line you're only going

01:11.060 --> 01:15.780
to have a field that points away from if it's positively charged.

01:15.780 --> 01:20.440
The field would have to point away from the 2D plate.

01:20.520 --> 01:26.280
It really doesn't make sense that there'd be any component over here that would be in the plane of the

01:26.280 --> 01:27.780
2D plate.

01:27.780 --> 01:34.830
So this actually simplifies our flux calculation because we don't have to worry about the flux on the

01:34.830 --> 01:38.490
sides of this little tube over here.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.830
No FLUX THROUGH THIS surface

01:45.370 --> 01:48.550
through through the sides just right through sides.

01:48.550 --> 01:54.790
I think that hopefully makes sense to you and that's simply because the angle between the vector that's

01:54.790 --> 01:56.540
perpendicular.

01:56.540 --> 02:03.250
All right here's my vector that is perpendicular and if the field's going up that means that the angle

02:03.250 --> 02:05.290
over here would be 90 degrees.

02:05.290 --> 02:08.160
So no FLUX THROUGH THE SIDES OF THIS SHAPE.

02:08.290 --> 02:11.610
Only flux going through the top and the bottom.

02:11.800 --> 02:17.620
Okay so now my little Goshen surface over here has a tiny little area here at the top.

02:18.310 --> 02:20.780
And it has the same area at the bottom.

02:21.340 --> 02:24.970
And again the direction now for the area is.

02:24.970 --> 02:28.290
Again it's parallel to both right.

02:28.300 --> 02:34.220
It's parallel to the electric field over here and it's also parallel to the electric field down here.

02:34.330 --> 02:41.870
So let's first think about how much charge is actually inside this tiny little box over here.

02:41.930 --> 02:42.170
All right.

02:42.190 --> 02:44.170
How much charge do we have.

02:44.170 --> 02:47.850
Well we only have a little bit of charge whatever charge is right here right.

02:47.890 --> 02:51.180
That's where the 2D plate intersects my shape.

02:51.340 --> 02:52.650
So let's first look at this one.

02:52.650 --> 02:59.770
So the charging closed again it's going to be the charge density Sigma and multiplied by the area that

02:59.770 --> 03:00.940
I'm considering over here.

03:00.940 --> 03:05.400
The area of my little box or the area of my cylinder and that's it.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.420
That's the total charging closed.

03:07.540 --> 03:12.990
So at the end we all we need to do now is look at how do we evaluate the left hand side of Gauss as

03:12.990 --> 03:13.960
low over here.

03:14.160 --> 03:20.600
Because the right hand side is simply Sigma multiplied by the area divided by epsilon 0.

03:20.610 --> 03:26.810
So for this one we need to look at the flux through the top and the flux through the bottom.

03:27.690 --> 03:30.520
Again no flux through the sides.

03:30.540 --> 03:37.170
So at the top again we just use our flux calculator which is just the electric field multiplied by the

03:37.170 --> 03:37.930
area.

03:38.130 --> 03:44.430
And then we have codes of zero degrees at the bottom we have the vector pointing away from the plate.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.520
So we have e the areas the same.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.340
And we also have codes of zero degrees.

03:50.760 --> 03:55.730
And this here has to be Sigma a over Epsilon 0.

03:55.920 --> 04:00.490
We don't have to worry about the coast of 0 term that simply equals the one.

04:00.630 --> 04:09.060
And look at these two terms these two terms are the exact same so you get two times E A equals the Sigma

04:09.110 --> 04:11.580
the same area divided by epsilon 0.

04:12.660 --> 04:16.550
So one thing we notice here is that the area is actually on both sides.

04:16.830 --> 04:21.570
And all you have to do is bring the two down in the denominator and you're left with the final answer

04:21.650 --> 04:28.680
that the electric field is simply Sigma my charge density divided by two Epsilon 0

04:32.030 --> 04:32.840
all right and that's it.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.780
That is the total electric field.

04:34.830 --> 04:39.280
Notice that this field here is constant.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.660
Right doesn't depend on the distance.

04:41.660 --> 04:43.500
There is no distance over here.

04:43.610 --> 04:49.670
Once you know the charge density of the plate that's at any point you evaluate that electric field you're

04:49.670 --> 04:51.760
going to get the same value.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.420
So let me go ahead and kind of draw this.

04:54.470 --> 04:56.380
Let's kind of remove this for a second.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.550
This was from the previous problem.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.490
So let's see what all of this means.

05:01.520 --> 05:01.750
OK.

05:01.790 --> 05:06.420
So imagine here I have a 2D plate and I'm just going to draw the side view.

05:06.860 --> 05:09.670
And here we have a certain charge density.

05:09.950 --> 05:15.500
That means if I want to draw this electric field I should let me change the color over here just so

05:15.500 --> 05:18.630
we can kind of see this a little bit better.

05:18.650 --> 05:18.890
All right.

05:18.890 --> 05:24.770
If I draw the electric field that means that the electric field over here points away from the plate.

05:25.040 --> 05:31.010
The electric field on this side points away from the plate and the electric field is uniform.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.570
OK.

05:32.720 --> 05:38.230
Which means that the magnitude of the field is simply Sigma divided by two Epsilon 0.

05:38.270 --> 05:43.980
It's also the same up here Sigma divided by two Epsilon 0.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.830
If I want to increase this value it really doesn't matter where you are right whether you're at position

05:48.830 --> 05:54.980
1 or whether you're at position 2 whether you're at position 3 the magnitude of the field is always

05:54.980 --> 05:56.510
going to be the same.

05:56.570 --> 06:00.310
Now the differential sorry the direction will be different right.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.930
Between 1 and 3.

06:01.970 --> 06:02.840
But that's it.

06:02.870 --> 06:05.410
The magnitude is going to be the same.

06:05.780 --> 06:09.760
If you had a 2D plate that was negatively charged.

06:09.830 --> 06:10.050
All right.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.620
So the charge density would be a negative sigma.

06:13.700 --> 06:17.570
Now the only difference would be that the field would be pointing toward it.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.000
But e is still constant

06:22.630 --> 06:28.780
and everywhere the field would simply be pointing toward that plate.

06:28.830 --> 06:32.650
There is no component that is parallel to the plate.

06:32.750 --> 06:35.980
The field is always perpendicular to plates.

06:37.220 --> 06:39.440
So that's how you would apply goes is law to this problem.
