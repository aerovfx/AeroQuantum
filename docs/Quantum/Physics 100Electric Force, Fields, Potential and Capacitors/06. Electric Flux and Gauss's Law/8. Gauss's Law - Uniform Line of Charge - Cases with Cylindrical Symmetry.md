# Gauss's Law - Uniform Line of Charge - Cases with Cylindrical Symmetry

## 06. Electric Flux and Gauss's Law

### Tóm tắt nội dung

I Bây giờ want to look at a different geometry. Được I want to Bây giờ take a whole bunch of point các điện tích and form a line with them. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to space them evenly Vậy we're gonna say that this line of điện tích is that the điện tích is uniformly distributed along that line. Vậy I want to think about Bây giờ how we're going to apply Gauss as law and we we want to find the field produced by this line of điện tích. If I'm a certain khoảng cách away from the điện tích Vậy let me have a look at it Đúng here. Imagine here I'm at some point and I'm a certain khoảng cách little are away from that line of điện tích. Again we're going to assume that the line of điện tích is very long Vậy it extends in both directions. Kind of like this. Được Vậy how do we find what mặt would we choose. That's number one. And then how do you find the charging close by the mặt. Vậy let's think about this and apply Gauss is law to find the field produced by this line of điện tích. Được. Vậy for this problem here I'm going to định nghĩa something called the lambda which is the amount of điện tích you have per unit length and this is going to be a hằng số for this problem. Được. Because I'm going to assume that you have a uniform điện tích distribution. Được. The second thing chúng ta có to do Bây giờ is defined a Goshen mặt. Vậy think about this wire over here. This line of điện tích. It really doesn't make sense to use a mặt like this that we use for spherical objects. Actually if you think about a wire Well it looks more like a hình trụ. Được. Vậy for anything that has kind of like a cylindrical shape like a wire we're going to use their Gaussian mặt that looks like a wire. And again we want to have the wire here has a certain length. Let's call this L and it has a certain radius which I'm calling R and this is really where I want to evaluate the field. OK. Vậy given all of this Bây giờ. Well we want to do Bây giờ is go back to Gauss is law. Let's find how much điện tích is enclosed here in this hình trụ. Vậy let's start with that. Vậy cue enclosed cue enclosed there's going to be my line density my điện tích density divided by the length that I have here multiplied by the length. This gives me the total điện tích that I have. Vậy if you go back to go says law Bây giờ this is the numerator on top of the Đúng hand side. Vậy let's go back to Gauss as lie with simply Đúng over Epsilon 0. And this has to be the total thông lượng. And this is a close mặt Đúng. Vậy this is the total thông lượng. That's it. Được rồi. Bây giờ how do we more specifically look at this term. Bây giờ if you think about a line of điện tích that extends in both directions over here the field produced by a line of điện tích has to be in this hướng. It doesn't make sense that there's any component here really that is along the axis and make sure you understand that part. And that's because if you think about what produces the field over here all of these các điện tích are going to tạo ra a field at this point. If you xem xét first the field produced by this little điện tích while that little điện tích would tạo ra a tiny little field like this but there's always a điện tích opposite of that that will tạo ra a field ví dụ like this at the end if you add both of those vectors you're going to get a véctơ that points away from the wire. There's always các điện tích tops and bottom Vậy that there's never any vertical component of this điện trường. Vậy the total field really has to be pointing out for any line of điện tích that's very long. Được rồi. Vậy that makes our job a little bit easier because remember chúng ta có to evaluate the total thông lượng. Vậy if I think about all these surfaces here here's the top mặt let's call it one. Here's the bottom mặt and call three the side mặt. Vậy if I'm going to write the total thông lượng going through that mặt I have to tính toán the thông lượng through mặt 1 the thông lượng through mặt 2 plus the thông lượng through mặt 3 and all this has to be equal to the Đúng hand side of Gauss is law Bây giờ. If you think about our area véctơ that we've defined there's different ones because these surfaces are in different orientations. If you think about a we did that those vectors in black before Đúng let's think about this is the hướng of a véctơ that is perpendicular to the mặt. Here's a véctơ that's perpendicular to mặt. Number two and a véctơ that is perpendicular to mặt. Number three. You notice that if chúng ta có that the field is pointing away from the wire and that our véctơ is pointing up for mặt one the angle over here between the field and the mặt the angle over here is 90 degrees the angle down over here for mặt 2 is also going to be 90 degrees. Vậy that really simplifies our expression over here that these thông lượng have to be equal to zero. There is Không electric thông lượng going through both of those surfaces at the top and the bottom of my hình trụ. Vậy all we're really left with is just the sides of this tube. Vậy how would we write down the thông lượng while you'd write down it would be the điện trường multiplied by the area. What is the area. The total area of the side of this hình trụ over here. Well if you think about it it's going to have. I mean imagine if you unrolled it Đúng. If you unrolled it it would simply look like a big rectangle. This here would be the length L and this khoảng cách here would be the total circumference of this sill. This circle over here would be the length L multiplied by the circumference which would be two pi times little r Được rồi. This here has to be equal to Lambda my điện tích density multiplied by the length divided by epsilon 0. Được rồi. One thing you notice over here is that the length can actually cancel out because they're on both sides and at the end we're left with just one expression for my field which looks like this. Vậy first of all the term in the front is different. It's two pi Epsilon 0 this time which is different from the point điện tích and Bây giờ it also depends on the line DNC the điện tích density divided by the radius or the khoảng cách away from the wire Được rồi there's the field. If you were gonna make a quick sketch of this. This means as I go far away from the wire that the field drops off. This is the khoảng cách and the độ lớn of the field. You see that the field is proportional to 1 over the khoảng cách. It drops off slower than a point điện tích for a point điện tích ví dụ the field dropped off much faster. Được rồi. For a point điện tích the field was proportional to one over our bình phương. Here it drops off much more slowly. Được rồi. Vậy keep that in mind. Anyway this is how you apply Gauss his law to an object that has cylindrical symmetry. Vậy I mean just write down cylindrical symmetry Vậy you would always try to choose a an object that also are a Goshen mặt that is also cylindrical and that makes that the area should be always a term that looks like this if you're dealing with wires again you typically don't have to worry about the tops and the bottoms of this Goshen mặt. You really only have to worry about the side.
