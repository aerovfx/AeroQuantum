00:00.280 --> 00:04.050
I now want to talk about Gauss his law and how you would apply to conductors.

00:04.110 --> 00:07.040
So let's take an arbitrarily shaped conductor over here.

00:07.080 --> 00:12.660
The one thing to remind you to remember about conductors is that the field inside a conductor.

00:12.660 --> 00:17.060
Let's just call it the inside must be equal to zero.

00:17.110 --> 00:23.650
OK so what happens now if I place some charge a net charge on that conductor of 10 micro cooling or

00:23.650 --> 00:26.280
what do you think happens to that charge.

00:26.280 --> 00:30.510
Well first of all what's going to happen is if this is positive charge again.

00:30.510 --> 00:37.440
So what would happen would be would distribute itself on the outside surface of that conductor.

00:37.470 --> 00:43.530
You can't have any charge inside and in order to prove that you can't have any charge inside you imagine

00:43.530 --> 00:51.040
if you have a Goshen surface over here which has kind of the shape which is just inside this surface.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.890
Right here's my Goshen surface

00:57.300 --> 01:01.050
if you were going to apply GAUSS LAW TO THIS PROBLEM IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS.

01:01.050 --> 01:08.070
YOU WOULD SAY THAT THE FLUX THROUGH THAT SURFACE must be equal to the charging closed divided by epsilon

01:08.070 --> 01:08.760
0.

01:09.630 --> 01:13.350
However have a look at it inside this Goshen surface.

01:13.410 --> 01:19.130
If all of this charge goes on the outside surface of the conductor the charging closed.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.720
In this case here has to be equal to zero.

01:23.070 --> 01:27.030
So we'd have that the total flux through that surface is equal to zero.

01:27.030 --> 01:33.450
The only way you can have the total flux is equal to zero for any arbitrarily any arbitrary shape of

01:33.450 --> 01:37.690
this Goshen surface is if the total field inside is zero.

01:37.700 --> 01:42.090
Because remember our flux is the field multiplied by the area.

01:42.230 --> 01:42.740
All right.

01:42.780 --> 01:50.360
The only way you're gonna have this equation is if the total field inside is equal to zero.

01:50.370 --> 01:55.080
And that's really really important about conductors okay.

01:55.100 --> 01:57.820
So we have to have that whenever you charge a conductor.

01:57.890 --> 02:00.260
Charge goes on the outside surface.

02:00.410 --> 02:05.140
All right let's have a look at a slightly more complicated case all right.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.420
So have a look at this case.

02:06.430 --> 02:13.450
Now again we're gonna say that our total conductor has a charge of ten micro cool on the outside.

02:13.450 --> 02:20.350
What now would happen if my conductor had a cavity on the inside of some arbitrary shape.

02:21.310 --> 02:26.980
So that means that the space inside this cavity is just empty space and all the conducting material

02:26.980 --> 02:28.960
is out here.

02:29.050 --> 02:32.370
Again it doesn't matter because e inside has to be zero.

02:32.440 --> 02:36.120
There can't be any charge inside this Goshen surface.

02:36.130 --> 02:39.280
So all the charge goes on the outside.

02:39.340 --> 02:44.030
The question is now imagine I do this inside this cavity.

02:44.110 --> 02:51.160
I place a charge of six micro cool on purple charge right here of six micro cool.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.990
Let me clean that up a little bit.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.390
Maybe use a smaller pen.

02:55.420 --> 03:00.130
Positive 6 micro cool home right here on the inside of that cavity.

03:00.220 --> 03:04.290
What happens to that 10 micro Coolum charge.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.280
What do you think happens to it.

03:06.620 --> 03:06.910
All right.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.210
So in order for now if you think about it.

03:10.880 --> 03:17.210
If I have a ocean surface the way I have a drawn right here now I'm enclosing some charge.

03:17.220 --> 03:23.660
I'm definitely enclosing the six micro cooling charge right because it's inside this purple charge is

03:23.660 --> 03:26.830
inside my Goshen surface.

03:26.830 --> 03:31.940
So but I do require that the field inside the conductor has to be zero.

03:31.940 --> 03:34.450
How do I square the circle over here.

03:34.460 --> 03:38.690
The only way I can do that is if this happens over here.

03:38.820 --> 03:46.660
You pick a different color so what's going to happen for me to get zero total charge inside here.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.420
And this is really what's required.

03:48.650 --> 03:51.970
I really need cueing close to be equal to zero.

03:51.980 --> 03:57.560
That's the only way to ensure that the electric field is zero inside the conductor.

03:57.860 --> 04:03.110
But if you have a look at it I'm already enclosing the six micro cooling

04:05.860 --> 04:09.100
because it's the purple charge inside my Goshen surface.

04:09.190 --> 04:12.980
What that means is I also have to enclose something else.

04:13.240 --> 04:18.680
There's also going to be some charge on the inside wall of the cavity.

04:19.240 --> 04:26.170
And for this equation to work out the charge of the inside wall must be equal to negative.

04:26.170 --> 04:32.610
I'll just call it I for inside wall must be equal to negative six micro cooling.

04:32.800 --> 04:33.960
So this is what it looks like.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.640
Let me draw those charges in pink.

04:36.070 --> 04:44.740
What's going to happen here is that you're going to have some charge equal to negative six micro cooling

04:45.400 --> 04:49.240
that's going to go on that inside wall of the cavity.

04:49.430 --> 04:49.680
Right.

04:49.730 --> 04:52.250
And all of this pink charge if you were going to add them all up.

04:52.270 --> 04:55.440
That would be equal to negative six micro cooling.

04:55.870 --> 05:03.250
This way my Goshen surface definitely encloses no net charge because you have six from the purple and

05:03.250 --> 05:06.640
you have negative six from the Pink.

05:06.640 --> 05:13.030
Those charges cancel out which means that the total charging closes zero and the only way I can have

05:13.030 --> 05:15.880
that is if the flux is zero.

05:15.970 --> 05:20.430
And that will ensure that the electric field is zero inside the conductor.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.330
Now there's one more thing to figure out.

05:22.330 --> 05:27.810
Well if I put negative six on the inside wall what happens on the outside wall.

05:27.910 --> 05:32.340
Previously all we had was are 10 micro Coolum on the outside.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.060
That's what we had here.

05:34.060 --> 05:38.470
This is the total charge of the conductor which still has to be true.

05:38.530 --> 05:43.770
However if you think about it the total charge of the conductor has to be whatever's on the inside wall

05:46.690 --> 05:53.020
plus whatever charge is going to be on the outside wall.

05:53.040 --> 05:57.270
We just figured out what was going to be on the inside wall was negative six.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.350
So let's go ahead and do that.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.660
So we have 10 micro cooling.

06:00.750 --> 06:09.960
We have negative six micro cool on for here plus whatever charge is going to be on the outside wall.

06:10.340 --> 06:18.020
So at the end the final expression I get for the outside wall must be 16 micro cooling.

06:19.070 --> 06:25.730
So that means compared to the previous case I'm actually going to have excess positive charge here on

06:25.730 --> 06:26.870
this outside wall

06:30.600 --> 06:38.800
the total charge of my conductor is still 10 but you have positive 16 micro cooling on the outside.

06:38.910 --> 06:45.240
You have negative six on the inside wall and this will ensure that the total electric field inside the

06:45.240 --> 06:47.400
conductor is still zero.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.360
Okay.

06:48.810 --> 06:51.830
In the problems later on I have a shell example.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.910
Similar example to this.

06:53.910 --> 06:56.340
So we'll have a look at this property again.

06:56.340 --> 06:56.660
Okay.
