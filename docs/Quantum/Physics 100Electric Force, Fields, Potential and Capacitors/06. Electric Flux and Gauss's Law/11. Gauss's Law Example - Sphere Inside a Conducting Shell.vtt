Hi everybody physics ninja here today.

00:01.860 --> 00:06.900
We're going to do is we're going to apply GAUSS LAW this equation right over here which is the integral

00:06.900 --> 00:14.230
of the electric field scalar product with the area is equal to cuing closed over Epsilon 0 we're going

00:14.220 --> 00:20.940
to apply Gauss as law in order to find the electric field everywhere in space and the geometry I'm considering

00:20.940 --> 00:22.900
here is the one shown in the figure.

00:23.010 --> 00:26.650
So what we have here is a sphere at the center of a shell.

00:26.790 --> 00:34.770
OK so the sphere the inner sphere has a radius a the outer shell has a thickness and the inner radius

00:34.770 --> 00:41.130
is B and the outer radius is C So how would you solve for the electric field everywhere in space.

00:41.270 --> 00:43.720
And what we're gonna do is we're going to consider two cases.

00:43.750 --> 00:50.270
OK so case number one for this inner sphere I'm going to assume that it is a conductor.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.210
OK.

00:51.330 --> 00:57.570
And again that inner shell or saw that inner sphere rather has a total charge equal to three Q The outer

00:57.570 --> 01:03.780
shell is has a total net charge of negative Q OK so how would you set up GAUSS LAW to solve for the

01:03.780 --> 01:09.210
electric field everywhere and for the second case what I'm going to do is I'm going to assume that this

01:09.330 --> 01:17.270
inner sphere is an insulator and the charge is uniformly distributed throughout the volume of that sphere.

01:17.280 --> 01:17.670
OK.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.220
So they've got two different cases.

01:20.610 --> 01:24.140
If it's insulating vs. conducting what is the difference.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.670
How do you set up Gauss is like what makes it different.

01:26.700 --> 01:32.280
OK so Case 1 here is the case where we're going to assume that this inner sphere is conducting.

01:32.540 --> 01:32.780
Okay.

01:32.790 --> 01:37.960
And my goal is define the electric field in Region 1 so anywhere within this sphere.

01:37.980 --> 01:42.270
So the first thing you do for Case 1 is if it's a conducting sphere.

01:42.340 --> 01:42.650
OK.

01:42.660 --> 01:44.740
This is a very very special word.

01:44.820 --> 01:53.520
If you hear that word conducting sphere it means by definition OK that the electric field inside must

01:53.520 --> 01:55.140
be equal to zero.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.740
Well how is that possible.

01:56.760 --> 01:57.260
OK.

01:57.330 --> 02:01.670
The only way that it's possible from Gauss is law that you get zero.

02:01.710 --> 02:08.810
The only way that's possible is if the enclosed charge of my Goshen surface also equals the zero.

02:08.850 --> 02:19.540
So what that means here is that this three Q must be spread out evenly on this spherical surface.

02:19.650 --> 02:20.480
OK so that's it.

02:20.730 --> 02:23.200
This is what's going to happen for a conductor.

02:23.250 --> 02:28.410
You can't have any charge anywhere inside because that would produce an electric field and then that

02:28.410 --> 02:31.500
means that the charges would move because there'd be a force acting on them.

02:31.500 --> 02:36.680
OK so Case 1 is kind of just the definition that the field inside a conductor must be zero.

02:36.690 --> 02:40.210
So all of the charge is going to be on the outside.

02:40.230 --> 02:48.000
OK now case 2 is a little bit more complicated so for Case 2 what we're going to assume here is that

02:48.000 --> 02:55.070
the charge is going to be uniformly distributed throughout the entire volume here of all right.

02:55.080 --> 03:00.460
We're gonna assume that it's uniformly distributed throughout the entire volume of the sphere.

03:00.530 --> 03:00.850
Okay.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.000
So what we have to do now is you.

03:03.030 --> 03:05.220
Now you really have to apply GAUSS LAW FOR THIS.

03:05.490 --> 03:08.800
SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO IS again draw our Gaussian surface.

03:08.910 --> 03:12.770
And that's again it's going to look like a sphere.

03:13.110 --> 03:17.500
Mine's a little bit rough looking that's OK and the sphere here has a certain radius.

03:17.670 --> 03:20.070
Let's call it radius little are like this.

03:20.070 --> 03:20.420
All right.

03:20.790 --> 03:23.940
So the question is how do you apply GAUSS LAW FOR THIS.

03:23.940 --> 03:31.200
SO SINCE THIS IS PHYSICALLY symmetric actually the left hand side of GAUSS LAW is always pretty straightforward.

03:31.200 --> 03:38.520
OK so first of all to get rid of this integral the integral will simply simplify to something like this.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.930
It's the electric field magnitude multiplied by the surface right.

03:42.950 --> 03:48.510
And the reason that it simplifies is because again the electric field produced by any amount of charge

03:48.510 --> 03:54.690
inside the sphere is going to be pointing straight out and the area is also all right.

03:54.720 --> 04:00.540
If I look at the little bit of area of my sphere that's also a vector that points radiantly outward.

04:00.540 --> 04:05.260
So what we need to do now is simply evaluate what is this total area of the sphere.

04:05.340 --> 04:11.580
And in this case it's simply for pi r square this is the formula for the surface of a sphere that has

04:11.580 --> 04:13.350
a radius are all right.

04:13.710 --> 04:21.120
So now you write down the rest of Gauss as law it's the charging close then this green surface and divided

04:21.120 --> 04:22.360
by epsilon 0.

04:22.380 --> 04:23.790
All right pretty straightforward.

04:23.880 --> 04:30.600
Now you have to use kind of your judgment here and try to evaluate how do we find how much charge is

04:30.600 --> 04:32.060
inside.

04:32.760 --> 04:40.710
Now it's not equal to three Q because three q is the total charge so it's going to be a fraction of

04:40.710 --> 04:42.350
the total charge right.

04:42.380 --> 04:48.640
If you think about how much charges and close let's go ahead and write it down give my marker.

04:48.670 --> 04:48.930
All right.

04:48.930 --> 04:55.040
So we have q enclosed is really going to be a fraction of the total charge.

04:55.140 --> 05:00.830
Now what you could also do is you could define a charge density which equals to the total charge divided

05:00.830 --> 05:04.120
by the total volume and then integrate over the volume.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.590
You really don't have to do that.

05:05.690 --> 05:10.190
You could just say it's going to be a volume fraction of the total charge.

05:10.340 --> 05:15.950
So this is would be the total volume of this sphere which is for pi r cube.

05:16.130 --> 05:17.780
And in this way it's a cube.

05:17.880 --> 05:20.860
Right because the radius of the sphere is a.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.670
And now how much volume is enclosed here in this green surface.

05:25.670 --> 05:29.830
It would be again for thirds pi r cube.

05:29.840 --> 05:35.530
All right well we can simplify this expression a little bit the four thirds cancel the PI cancel and

05:35.540 --> 05:43.910
my total charge is really three Q So at the end this year simplifies to our cube multiplied by three

05:43.910 --> 05:48.860
Q I'll put the three in the front and divided by a cube.

05:49.380 --> 05:53.710
Okay so now I'm just gonna put everything together Let me give myself a little bit of extra space here

05:53.720 --> 05:54.890
kind of shrink that down.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.160
Okay so now we plug everything into Gauss law.

05:58.160 --> 06:07.730
So again the left hand side was e multiplied by 4 pi r squared in the right hand side was Q in close

06:07.730 --> 06:10.210
which is my expression here divided by epsilon 0.

06:10.220 --> 06:18.340
So it's just 3 R cube big Q and divided by epsilon 0 a cube.

06:18.380 --> 06:20.720
Okay we could simplify a few of the terms here.

06:20.720 --> 06:25.940
First of all you notice you have r squared here and you have our cube here which means you could get

06:25.940 --> 06:30.920
rid of two of them and get rid of the two appear you're still left with one.

06:31.170 --> 06:35.970
And at the end you just want one final expression for my electric field magnitude.

06:36.170 --> 06:41.480
So I bring the four pi down to the bottom so you get one over for Pi Epsilon zero.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.350
You kind of always have that term right.

06:43.460 --> 06:47.200
And then let's look at all the terms that are left.

06:47.250 --> 06:53.620
3 q is the charge so that term is there and I still have divided by a cube.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.460
That's just the constant term.

06:55.550 --> 06:58.120
That's the radius of this sphere.

06:58.490 --> 07:00.850
And then at the end I can't forget this.

07:00.980 --> 07:03.370
R And this is really really important right.

07:03.410 --> 07:09.040
So this is it depends linearly with the distance away from the center.

07:09.170 --> 07:12.170
So to kind of really different results.

07:12.170 --> 07:12.440
Right.

07:12.440 --> 07:16.750
If it's insulating and the charge is uniformly distributed this is what you get.

07:16.850 --> 07:20.040
And if it's a conducting sphere you would get zero.

07:20.060 --> 07:20.590
OK.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.720
All the way up until the surface.

07:22.820 --> 07:23.080
All right.

07:23.090 --> 07:24.860
So now let's consider the second region.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.040
So for Region 2 now.

07:28.040 --> 07:29.720
Region 2 is in this white area.

07:29.720 --> 07:33.820
This white space between the sphere and that outer shell.

07:33.920 --> 07:40.580
And again what you first do is you draw your Goshen surface somewhere within that white region.

07:40.730 --> 07:42.990
And my goal now is to write down Gauss as law.

07:43.310 --> 07:45.650
So again it's physically symmetric.

07:45.650 --> 07:53.870
So the left hand side of Gauss is law basically always reduces to this for PI and the area of this sphere

07:53.870 --> 07:56.660
is for Pi are squared.

07:56.720 --> 07:56.930
OK.

07:56.960 --> 08:04.400
That was the left hand side of Gauss his law equals the Q and closed divided by my constant Epsilon

08:04.400 --> 08:04.880
0.

08:05.690 --> 08:12.940
So now you ask yourself how much charge is enclosed by this shell or by this Gaussian surface rather.

08:13.000 --> 08:19.400
And again if you have a look at the diagram how much charges is close will all of this charge that is

08:19.400 --> 08:23.510
inside this inner sphere is enclosed right.

08:23.540 --> 08:30.290
And whether it's conducting or whether it's insulating it really doesn't matter because that total charge

08:30.290 --> 08:32.060
was 3 q all right.

08:32.060 --> 08:36.330
The only difference if it's conducting or insulating it's the way that the charge is spread out.

08:36.380 --> 08:42.380
But really this charging close is always 3 q so I can just go ahead and write it down that's the total

08:42.380 --> 08:45.720
charge and closed divided by epsilon 0.

08:45.800 --> 08:52.370
Again just rewrite the left hand side of Gauss as law here and again bring the 4 pi are squared at the

08:52.370 --> 08:55.090
bottom and this is what we're left with.

08:55.190 --> 09:03.190
Total charges 3 q divided by 4 pi Epsilon 0 multiplied or sorry divided by our squared like this.

09:03.350 --> 09:07.480
All right so this looks like a familiar expression right.

09:07.490 --> 09:14.550
This looks like exactly the field produced by a point charge that would have a charge equal to three

09:14.550 --> 09:19.260
Q And that charge would all be concentrated at one point.

09:19.340 --> 09:19.550
Right.

09:19.550 --> 09:24.110
And if I'm a distance are away this would be the expression I would use to find the magnitude of the

09:24.110 --> 09:26.290
field produced by that point charge.

09:26.320 --> 09:26.690
OK.

09:26.720 --> 09:29.060
Kind of a nice result from Gauss is law.

09:29.310 --> 09:30.850
Let's consider the third region now.

09:32.200 --> 09:36.110
So Region 3 now is anywhere inside this outer shell.

09:36.120 --> 09:40.540
However in the statement of the problem I said something really really important.

09:40.590 --> 09:41.130
Okay.

09:41.250 --> 09:45.200
I said that this outer shell is a conductor.

09:45.230 --> 09:45.480
Okay.

09:45.480 --> 09:49.080
And this is really really the key to this problem right here.

09:49.110 --> 09:56.580
So if it's a conductor you should automatically know the field inside anywhere inside this the field

09:56.580 --> 10:04.680
inside the outer shell which is right it is e subscript shell must be equal to zero it's a conductor.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.890
Now if you think back of our Gauss is law we'll think about our Gauss is law.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.680
How would we get to zero.

10:09.780 --> 10:10.050
Right.

10:10.050 --> 10:14.670
How would we get zero for the electric field in this region.

10:14.670 --> 10:22.590
Well let's write down Gauss is law the left hand side of Gauss is law would be if he multiplied by four

10:22.590 --> 10:23.760
pi are squared.

10:23.850 --> 10:27.450
Again this is as physically symmetric object.

10:27.450 --> 10:35.200
So this is how it would look like in the area of my Gaussian surface over here is for Pi our squared.

10:35.430 --> 10:41.090
Now this has to be equal to q in close divided by epsilon 0.

10:41.850 --> 10:47.780
But how do we get Q in closed for this problem.

10:47.790 --> 10:51.310
Well let's think about how much charge is enclosed here.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.410
So we have charging close we definitely having closed all of this right.

10:55.440 --> 11:03.500
Because my ocean surface is out here and I have 3 Q Okay but I do require this statement right.

11:03.510 --> 11:10.980
How do I get zero electric field the only way I can really have zero electric field is if my Q closed

11:11.400 --> 11:13.460
must also be equal to zero.

11:13.800 --> 11:18.690
If queueing close the zero then automatically the field is going to be zero.

11:18.960 --> 11:27.120
So that means that there has to be some charge that has to go on this inner wall of the shell.

11:27.390 --> 11:32.220
And now the question is how much charge goes on this inner wall.

11:32.280 --> 11:33.010
Well let's.

11:33.090 --> 11:37.440
We have to add it up because it's going to be enclosed by this Gaussian surface.

11:37.440 --> 11:42.210
So it's gonna be plus Q What is right is inner wall.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.260
OK.

11:43.410 --> 11:48.440
So at the end of the day we do require that the Q enclosed over here is equal to zero.

11:48.660 --> 11:55.560
And the only way you can have this because I do have the three each Q enclosed from this sphere.

11:55.560 --> 12:03.500
That means that the inner wall Q inner wall must be opposite of whatever the total charges from this

12:03.500 --> 12:04.650
sphere.

12:04.650 --> 12:10.050
So at the end of the day I find that the only way I can have zero electric field inside this conductor

12:12.710 --> 12:17.730
is if the charge on this inner wall is equal to negative three.

12:17.730 --> 12:25.720
Q This is a requirement and this will ensure that the total charge enclosed is going to be zero.

12:25.760 --> 12:30.380
And that is going to force that electric field to also be zero.

12:30.710 --> 12:33.490
Okay so go ahead and write this so.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.550
Q inner wall

12:38.260 --> 12:40.070
must be equal to negative 3.

12:40.070 --> 12:46.720
Q All right so this way you add negative 3 q to the plus three Q of the sphere and you're going to get

12:46.720 --> 12:49.320
zero total charge in closed.

12:49.540 --> 12:55.180
If I have zero total charge and closed I'm going to get zero electric field anywhere in this region

12:57.580 --> 13:03.340
so the next question we have to ask ourselves is well if this inner wall has negative three Q like we

13:03.340 --> 13:06.690
calculated here what about the outer wall.

13:06.710 --> 13:12.480
Right how much charge is actually on this surface over here of that shell.

13:12.630 --> 13:18.370
And in order to answer that you simply have to look at the total charge of that conductor in this problem

13:18.370 --> 13:21.050
I said that the total charge of the conductor was negative.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.450
Q All right.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.950
So this is kind of oil it looks like.

13:23.950 --> 13:24.420
Right.

13:24.490 --> 13:33.160
So cue total for the shell has to be equal to whatever is on the inner wall inner.

13:33.190 --> 13:36.450
I'll just write as Q inner plus whatever's on the outer wall.

13:37.070 --> 13:37.510
OK.

13:37.930 --> 13:43.900
And the total charge of the shell is given by this no negative Q This is what we had this was negative

13:43.900 --> 13:52.390
Q we just solve for what was on this inner wall the inner wall we said was negative three Q So plus

13:52.390 --> 13:54.490
q outer.

13:54.700 --> 13:59.800
So at the end now we just bring the negative three Q On the other side you're left with that the charge

13:59.800 --> 14:08.080
on the outer surface charge on the outer surface must be equal to to Q You have no choice you have to

14:08.080 --> 14:10.260
have conservation of charge.

14:10.450 --> 14:16.690
So if I put negative Q on here that means that on the inner wall I'm going to get negative three Q And

14:16.690 --> 14:20.090
on the outer wall I have to have plus two.

14:20.090 --> 14:25.940
Q That's the only way that both of those are going to sum up to equal to the total charge on the shell.

14:26.040 --> 14:31.780
Okay because negative three plus two gives me negative 1 which is what I said in the problem statement

14:32.740 --> 14:38.980
and you have this distribution of charge because we do require that the field is equal to zero everywhere

14:38.980 --> 14:41.860
in this shell because it's a conductor.

14:41.860 --> 14:44.620
All right let's go on to the final region.

14:45.020 --> 14:50.530
OK so this is now region for what I've drawn is a ocean surface that is on the outside because this

14:50.530 --> 14:56.170
is where I want to evaluate the field I want to evaluate it when the radius is bigger than C so I want

14:56.170 --> 15:01.990
to be on the outside of that conducting shell right again we apply Gauss is a lot of this problem we

15:01.990 --> 15:09.970
want to look at the field dotted with the area it's a spherical service so the area of that sphere is

15:09.970 --> 15:15.380
for Pi our squared always the same thing for spherical symmetric objects.

15:15.490 --> 15:15.660
All right.

15:15.670 --> 15:23.610
This must be equal to again how much charge is enclosed by that surface divided by epsilon 0.

15:23.770 --> 15:27.730
Well now let's look at what is Q and closed for this problem.

15:27.730 --> 15:32.900
Well number one I am enclosing this entire sphere right.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.380
I definitely have all of that charge.

15:35.470 --> 15:41.110
So if you go ahead and write this you have to have definitely plus three Q is enclosed by this Gaussian

15:41.110 --> 15:42.880
surface what else.

15:42.880 --> 15:51.070
I am also enclosing all of the charge that is on the shell and all of the charge on the shell is well

15:51.070 --> 15:51.700
it's negative.

15:51.700 --> 16:00.610
Q So at the end what I have is to Q This has to be the total charge enclosed by my Gaussian surface

16:00.610 --> 16:01.610
in this case.

16:01.660 --> 16:09.010
So we go ahead we substitute that into Gauss as law so you get e for Pi are squared must be equal to

16:09.370 --> 16:15.850
to Q divided by epsilon 0 to get the final expression you just bring all of this term in the bracket

16:15.850 --> 16:25.630
here down in the denominator on the other side so you'll get to Q divided by 4 pi Epsilon 0 and over

16:25.630 --> 16:31.480
our squared again if you look at this result this would be the result that you would get if you had

16:31.480 --> 16:40.060
a point charge and if the point charge was equal to 2 Q and I was a certain distance R away from that

16:40.060 --> 16:40.870
point charge right.

16:40.870 --> 16:45.890
This is if I'm evaluating what is the field at this point I would get the exact same result.

16:45.930 --> 16:46.320
Okay.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.970
And that's kind of obtained from Gauss is low this way.

16:48.970 --> 16:53.730
So here's a summary of the results that we obtain let's try to make a sketch now.

16:53.770 --> 17:00.070
So for the region from what I'm plotting here is the magnitude of the electric field this just right

17:00.080 --> 17:08.140
is E here on the y axis and I have the distance R on this x axis and let's draw the different cases.

17:08.140 --> 17:14.200
So the first we're gonna do is well if it's a conducting sphere then you should have zero here.

17:14.210 --> 17:19.150
Now this other one is if it's insulating let me put it in a different color over here it should be a

17:19.150 --> 17:24.830
linear relationship and it should go all the way to the top over here.

17:25.020 --> 17:25.470
OK.

17:25.500 --> 17:31.300
So the field grows as I get away from the distance could I end up being closing more charge.

17:31.330 --> 17:31.850
All right.

17:31.850 --> 17:39.130
And let's do the second region the field is kind of the same it starts off in both cases appear and

17:39.130 --> 17:48.480
it rolls off as one over R squared so it should look something like this over here.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.190
Right.

17:49.300 --> 17:53.250
Should roll off here and this is like a one over our squared dependence.

17:53.260 --> 17:54.360
All right.

17:54.390 --> 17:55.630
And what about the next part.

17:56.310 --> 17:59.820
The region here in the shell between B and C.

17:59.820 --> 18:02.250
So in that case that case is pretty easy to draw.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.370
It should just be zero because it's a conductor.

18:05.370 --> 18:11.400
And in the last region again it should probably start at some value over here.

18:11.420 --> 18:15.110
It's going to be lower than this because I'm further out.

18:15.360 --> 18:19.240
And again it's gonna roll off as one over R squared.

18:19.260 --> 18:23.470
Again this is proportional to the distance squared.

18:23.520 --> 18:28.320
All right this is kind of what it looks like again in these regions here you could have zero because

18:28.320 --> 18:29.940
it's a conductor.

18:29.940 --> 18:34.140
And again it depends on the case here that I looked at but this is what a sketch would look like for

18:34.140 --> 18:36.060
this electric field.

18:36.360 --> 18:36.630
All right.

18:36.630 --> 18:37.680
Thanks for watching folks.

18:37.680 --> 18:41.640
Hopefully you understood it and you become a better problem solver.
