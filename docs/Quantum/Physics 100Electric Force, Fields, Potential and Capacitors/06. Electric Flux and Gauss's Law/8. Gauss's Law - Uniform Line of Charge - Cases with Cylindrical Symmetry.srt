00:00.330 --> 00:02.950
I now want to look at a different geometry.

00:02.970 --> 00:08.430
Okay I want to now take a whole bunch of point charges and form a line with them.

00:08.790 --> 00:13.920
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to space them evenly so we're gonna say that this line of charge

00:14.280 --> 00:19.590
is that the charge is uniformly distributed along that line.

00:19.590 --> 00:25.020
So I want to think about now how we're going to apply Gauss as law and we we want to find the field

00:25.020 --> 00:27.230
produced by this line of charge.

00:27.300 --> 00:32.350
If I'm a certain distance away from the charge so let me have a look at it right here.

00:32.370 --> 00:39.240
Imagine here I'm at some point and I'm a certain distance little are away from that line of charge.

00:39.270 --> 00:44.380
Again we're going to assume that the line of charge is very long so it extends in both directions.

00:44.490 --> 00:45.900
Kind of like this.

00:45.940 --> 00:49.800
Okay so how do we find what surface would we choose.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.170
That's number one.

00:51.330 --> 00:55.320
And then how do you find the charging close by the surface.

00:55.380 --> 01:02.160
So let's think about this and apply Gauss is law to find the field produced by this line of charge.

01:02.310 --> 01:02.550
Okay.

01:02.590 --> 01:08.260
So for this problem here I'm going to define something called the lambda which is the amount of charge

01:08.680 --> 01:13.250
you have per unit length and this is going to be a constant for this problem.

01:13.320 --> 01:13.600
Okay.

01:13.630 --> 01:18.620
Because I'm going to assume that you have a uniform charge distribution.

01:19.110 --> 01:19.710
Okay.

01:19.750 --> 01:24.920
The second thing we have to do now is defined a Goshen surface.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.450
So think about this wire over here.

01:27.450 --> 01:28.760
This line of charge.

01:28.870 --> 01:33.910
It really doesn't make sense to use a surface like this that we use for spherical objects.

01:33.910 --> 01:37.630
Actually if you think about a wire Well it looks more like a cylinder.

01:37.650 --> 01:37.950
Okay.

01:37.990 --> 01:44.260
So for anything that has kind of like a cylindrical shape like a wire we're going to use their Gaussian

01:44.260 --> 01:47.420
surface that looks like a wire.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.330
And again we want to have the wire here has a certain length.

01:51.340 --> 01:56.230
Let's call this L and it has a certain radius which I'm calling R and this is really where I want to

01:56.230 --> 01:58.600
evaluate the field.

01:58.660 --> 01:58.980
OK.

01:59.020 --> 02:00.740
So given all of this now.

02:00.840 --> 02:02.970
Well we want to do now is go back to Gauss is law.

02:02.970 --> 02:07.120
Let's find how much charge is enclosed here in this cylinder.

02:07.300 --> 02:08.290
So let's start with that.

02:08.290 --> 02:16.780
So cue enclosed cue enclosed there's going to be my line density my charge density divided by the length

02:16.780 --> 02:19.380
that I have here multiplied by the length.

02:19.540 --> 02:22.560
This gives me the total charge that I have.

02:22.600 --> 02:28.040
So if you go back to go says law now this is the numerator on top of the right hand side.

02:28.240 --> 02:32.520
So let's go back to Gauss as lie with simply right over Epsilon 0.

02:32.650 --> 02:35.130
And this has to be the total flux.

02:35.950 --> 02:37.570
And this is a close surface right.

02:37.570 --> 02:39.060
So this is the total flux.

02:39.070 --> 02:40.710
That's it.

02:40.780 --> 02:41.050
All right.

02:41.050 --> 02:44.210
Now how do we more specifically look at this term.

02:44.380 --> 02:49.420
Now if you think about a line of charge that extends in both directions over here the field produced

02:49.420 --> 02:53.310
by a line of charge has to be in this direction.

02:53.590 --> 03:00.400
It doesn't make sense that there's any component here really that is along the axis and make sure you

03:00.400 --> 03:02.010
understand that part.

03:02.190 --> 03:07.750
And that's because if you think about what produces the field over here all of these charges are going

03:07.750 --> 03:09.880
to produce a field at this point.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.920
If you consider first the field produced by this little charge while that little charge would produce

03:14.920 --> 03:22.300
a tiny little field like this but there's always a charge opposite of that that will produce a field

03:22.840 --> 03:28.150
for example like this at the end if you add both of those vectors you're going to get a vector that

03:28.150 --> 03:30.050
points away from the wire.

03:30.340 --> 03:35.740
There's always charges tops and bottom so that there's never any vertical component of this electric

03:35.740 --> 03:36.770
field.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.840
So the total field really has to be pointing out for any line of charge that's very long.

03:43.840 --> 03:44.080
All right.

03:44.110 --> 03:50.150
So that makes our job a little bit easier because remember we have to evaluate the total flux.

03:50.230 --> 03:55.560
So if I think about all these surfaces here here's the top surface let's call it one.

03:55.570 --> 04:00.110
Here's the bottom surface and call three the side surface.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.600
So if I'm going to write the total flux going through that surface I have to calculate the flux through

04:04.600 --> 04:11.980
surface 1 the flux through surface 2 plus the flux through surface 3 and all this has to be equal to

04:12.700 --> 04:16.200
the right hand side of Gauss is law now.

04:16.210 --> 04:20.740
If you think about our area vector that we've defined there's different ones because these surfaces

04:20.740 --> 04:23.780
are in different orientations.

04:23.860 --> 04:30.880
If you think about a we did that those vectors in black before right let's think about this is the direction

04:30.940 --> 04:34.910
of a vector that is perpendicular to the surface.

04:34.910 --> 04:37.480
Here's a vector that's perpendicular to surface.

04:37.480 --> 04:41.650
Number two and a vector that is perpendicular to surface.

04:41.650 --> 04:43.510
Number three.

04:44.020 --> 04:51.640
You notice that if we have that the field is pointing away from the wire and that our vector is pointing

04:51.700 --> 05:00.730
up for surface one the angle over here between the field and the surface the angle over here is 90 degrees

05:01.330 --> 05:06.320
the angle down over here for Surface 2 is also going to be 90 degrees.

05:06.340 --> 05:12.510
So that really simplifies our expression over here that these flux have to be equal to zero.

05:12.550 --> 05:18.090
There is no electric flux going through both of those surfaces at the top and the bottom of my cylinder.

05:18.130 --> 05:23.920
So all we're really left with is just the sides of this tube.

05:23.920 --> 05:29.530
So how would we write down the flux while you'd write down it would be the electric field multiplied

05:29.530 --> 05:31.470
by the area.

05:31.780 --> 05:32.770
What is the area.

05:32.770 --> 05:38.130
The total area of the side of this cylinder over here.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.710
Well if you think about it it's going to have.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.540
I mean imagine if you unrolled it right.

05:42.630 --> 05:46.520
If you unrolled it it would simply look like a big rectangle.

05:46.540 --> 05:54.150
This here would be the length L and this distance here would be the total circumference of this sill.

05:54.220 --> 06:01.210
This circle over here would be the length L multiplied by the circumference which would be two pi times

06:01.210 --> 06:03.280
little r All right.

06:03.280 --> 06:11.280
This here has to be equal to Lambda my charge density multiplied by the length divided by epsilon 0.

06:11.500 --> 06:11.770
All right.

06:11.770 --> 06:16.420
One thing you notice over here is that the length can actually cancel out because they're on both sides

06:17.100 --> 06:22.560
and at the end we're left with just one expression for my field which looks like this.

06:22.570 --> 06:24.840
So first of all the term in the front is different.

06:24.850 --> 06:31.510
It's two pi Epsilon 0 this time which is different from the point charge and now it also depends on

06:31.780 --> 06:43.370
the line DNC the charge density divided by the radius or the distance away from the wire all right there's

06:43.410 --> 06:44.160
the field.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.170
If you were gonna make a quick sketch of this.

06:47.760 --> 06:54.630
This means as I go far away from the wire that the field drops off.

06:54.740 --> 06:58.260
This is the distance and the magnitude of the field.

06:58.340 --> 07:02.780
You see that the field is proportional to 1 over the distance.

07:02.780 --> 07:11.300
It drops off slower than a point charge for a point charge for example the field dropped off much faster.

07:11.450 --> 07:11.840
All right.

07:11.840 --> 07:17.250
For a point charge the field was proportional to one over our squared.

07:17.330 --> 07:20.270
Here it drops off much more slowly.

07:20.330 --> 07:20.580
All right.

07:20.600 --> 07:21.830
So keep that in mind.

07:21.980 --> 07:27.420
Anyway this is how you apply Gauss his law to an object that has cylindrical symmetry.

07:27.560 --> 07:39.000
So I mean just write down cylindrical symmetry so you would always try to choose a an object that also

07:39.000 --> 07:46.110
are a Goshen surface that is also cylindrical and that makes that the area should be always a term that

07:46.110 --> 07:51.180
looks like this if you're dealing with wires again you typically don't have to worry about the tops

07:51.180 --> 07:53.520
and the bottoms of this Goshen surface.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.620
You really only have to worry about the side.
