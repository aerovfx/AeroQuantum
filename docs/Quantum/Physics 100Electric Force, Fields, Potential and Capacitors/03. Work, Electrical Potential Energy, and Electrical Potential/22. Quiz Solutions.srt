WEBVTT

00:00.210 --> 00:06.650
So here's the first question here we have as a proton moves in the direction of electric field lines.

00:06.870 --> 00:12.300
Then we have some choices is moving from low to high potential gaining potential energy.

00:12.330 --> 00:15.680
Then we have all of kind of the different variations.

00:16.050 --> 00:16.260
All right.

00:16.260 --> 00:20.820
So I think what I would suggest over here is you just kind of draw what's going on so let's draw an

00:20.820 --> 00:21.840
electric field.

00:21.840 --> 00:22.590
All right.

00:22.980 --> 00:25.120
Let's take the simplest case over here.

00:25.150 --> 00:25.400
Right.

00:25.410 --> 00:28.950
Here's an electric field and draw a proton right.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.350
Here's a proton so there would be a force acting on the proton which would be QE.

00:34.350 --> 00:34.560
All right.

00:34.590 --> 00:36.420
So that's from the force perspective.

00:36.420 --> 00:38.330
But what about the potential.

00:38.520 --> 00:43.800
Now if I have field lines that point from the left to the right it means that this side over here imagine

00:43.800 --> 00:45.750
what would produce an electric field like this.

00:45.750 --> 00:45.960
Right.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.400
We might have a positive plate.

00:48.690 --> 00:53.180
And if the electric field lines finish over here that would mean that this side here would be negative.

00:53.190 --> 00:53.690
Right.

00:53.730 --> 01:00.950
Because that would give me a force that would be the reason why the proton would move toward the right.

01:00.950 --> 01:02.600
Right move toward the negative plate.

01:03.420 --> 01:05.530
So if this is positive right.

01:05.550 --> 01:08.180
We say that this here is at a high voltage.

01:08.670 --> 01:09.790
This is high.

01:10.050 --> 01:16.260
For example let's just set it to 30 volts imagine this one here this one here might be negative 30 volts

01:16.290 --> 01:17.680
that would be the potential.

01:17.730 --> 01:17.920
All right.

01:17.940 --> 01:18.820
So let's go see what is.

01:19.110 --> 01:21.680
It's moving from a low potential to high potential.

01:21.690 --> 01:25.680
No it's moving from high potential toward low potential.

01:25.750 --> 01:32.520
It can't be that can't be in Choice C Right Choice C says oh sorry to a C could still be right or it

01:32.520 --> 01:36.610
can't be choice B B says it's moving from low to high.

01:36.600 --> 01:36.810
OK.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.920
So we can't do that.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.270
So it has to be from high potential toward low potential.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.660
The second part deals with the energy.

01:44.670 --> 01:44.940
OK.

01:44.970 --> 01:50.610
So what happens to the energy as it moves both its potential remain constant.

01:50.650 --> 01:57.030
It's not going to remain constant so let's get rid of choice e because it's moving like this.

01:57.090 --> 01:57.780
All right.

01:57.780 --> 02:01.770
So what happens to the potential energy if you remember potential energy.

02:01.770 --> 02:08.660
We read it as queue times V for now let's just assume that the proton charge as we know it's positive.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.820
But let's just set it to one cooling.

02:11.010 --> 02:15.300
So what would that mean for the potential energy over here the potential energy on this side would be

02:15.720 --> 02:20.100
well que times V so it'd be one times 30 and this would be positive.

02:20.100 --> 02:20.700
Right.

02:20.700 --> 02:28.660
Positive 30 joules and then what happens while over here it would be you final would be Q would be one.

02:28.740 --> 02:30.450
The potential is negative 30.

02:30.450 --> 02:30.720
Right.

02:30.720 --> 02:37.830
So it'd be negative 30 joules so it has to lose electrical potential energy because what's happening

02:38.460 --> 02:40.820
it's going faster down over here.

02:40.830 --> 02:41.400
Right.

02:41.430 --> 02:44.670
It's gaining kinetic energy over here.

02:44.850 --> 02:48.540
If something gains kinetic energy it has to come from somewhere.

02:48.550 --> 02:52.440
OK so it has to be losing electrical potential energy.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.370
So really D has to be the right case over here.

02:56.580 --> 02:59.620
It can't be gaining electrical potential energy.

02:59.730 --> 03:00.000
All right.

03:00.030 --> 03:01.500
So that's it for the first problem.

03:01.590 --> 03:03.960
Hopefully you understand that one.

03:03.970 --> 03:04.270
All right.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.550
So there's the next problem.

03:05.560 --> 03:11.530
If the electrical potential is zero at some place in space then they talk about the electric field at

03:11.530 --> 03:17.940
that point must be negative zero uniform positive impossible to determine.

03:17.950 --> 03:18.290
All right.

03:18.640 --> 03:23.800
So first we have to figure out well what happens when the potential is zero.

03:23.800 --> 03:29.170
What I would suggest in this case is we try to figure out the simplest possible case where the potential

03:29.170 --> 03:30.550
is zero.

03:30.550 --> 03:32.150
I'm going to use point charges.

03:32.160 --> 03:32.740
Right.

03:32.830 --> 03:37.660
And we know that right over here at this right at the midpoint if these charges are the same.

03:37.660 --> 03:44.350
So if this is kind of plus q and this guy's negative Q that V at the center should be equal to zero

03:45.150 --> 03:46.380
because they would cancel out.

03:46.390 --> 03:46.630
Right.

03:46.630 --> 03:54.130
You would have k q over R and then you would have K and negative q over our member having the sign of

03:54.130 --> 03:57.370
the charge is important when you calculate the electrical potential.

03:57.370 --> 04:00.590
So we would get zero volts right here at the center.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.500
What else do we know.

04:03.130 --> 04:06.190
What is the electrical field at that point.

04:06.190 --> 04:11.950
Well the electrical field we know is points away from positive toward negative right.

04:12.130 --> 04:15.030
The electric field is in this direction over here.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.400
So we can't really say if it's negative right.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.680
Negative just tells us the direction is definitely not zero.

04:22.810 --> 04:25.870
It's not necessarily going to be uniform.

04:25.870 --> 04:32.200
The electric field I mean it's just that one point I'm positive again you can't really say I would say

04:32.200 --> 04:36.960
he is probably the best answer for this problem right here based on what's given.

04:36.970 --> 04:41.680
The only thing I could say is that there is an electric field at that point even though the voltage

04:41.680 --> 04:42.500
is zero.

04:42.500 --> 04:42.720
OK.

04:42.730 --> 04:44.250
Kind of a little bit of a tricky question.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.410
Here's problem three we have four charges here.

04:48.410 --> 04:53.140
Two of them are positive to a negative and they're in this kind of three dimensions over here.

04:53.270 --> 04:54.830
They have the same magnitude.

04:54.830 --> 04:56.630
They just have different signs.

04:56.630 --> 04:56.870
All right.

04:57.070 --> 04:57.560
OK.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.980
Let me kind of highlight which ones are negative over here make those in red.

05:01.100 --> 05:02.540
They pop out a bit more.

05:02.540 --> 05:07.850
All right they're all the same distance from the origin which is over here.

05:07.850 --> 05:12.650
What is the electrical potential at point p due to these charges.

05:12.950 --> 05:13.280
OK.

05:13.280 --> 05:18.080
So if we think about is it going to be zero positive negative or impossible to determine.

05:18.140 --> 05:24.620
Well if they're all arranged like this one thing we should know is they're all kind of the same distance

05:25.210 --> 05:25.520
right.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.750
They're all the same distance because the distance from the origin is the same.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.900
They're all a certain distance.

05:33.200 --> 05:40.170
Let's call it D from the origin which means that this distance R is also all the same for both of them.

05:40.190 --> 05:45.320
So if you would be calculating the total electrical potential what you would do is I mean for the first

05:45.320 --> 05:53.840
one over here what you would do is you would have k q over R you'd have another term like this for the

05:53.840 --> 06:00.940
second charge which we k q over R and then you would have two terms with negative charges.

06:01.040 --> 06:05.150
I would put negative Q here and then over R and then I'd have another term right.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.480
Plus K negative q over R.

06:08.920 --> 06:13.280
So at the end when I would add all of those things I'd have two positive ones and two negatives I would

06:13.280 --> 06:15.550
have zero volts.

06:15.660 --> 06:18.920
So we'd have zero electrical potential.

06:18.980 --> 06:25.190
So again the best choice for this one here is probably a choice a all right.

06:25.220 --> 06:29.750
Let's now look at this problem over here what we have is an electron and a proton they're release from

06:29.750 --> 06:35.030
rest and there's only electrostatic forces acting between them which are the following statements must

06:35.030 --> 06:36.140
be true.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.510
And they said there could be more than one charge.

06:38.510 --> 06:38.690
All right.

06:38.720 --> 06:45.860
So they talk about the energy potential energy either increasing or decreasing the kinetic energy and

06:45.860 --> 06:47.870
the acceleration keeps decreasing.

06:47.870 --> 06:48.110
All right.

06:48.590 --> 06:50.240
So let's have a look at it first of all.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.620
So let's just draw it out.

06:51.620 --> 06:56.660
Imagine we have a proton and an electron it doesn't matter what we put for the charges.

06:56.660 --> 07:03.500
So what we could do is here let's just call this 1 1 cool dome and negative 1.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.170
Cool.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.190
It doesn't matter whether we have the right charge.

07:06.320 --> 07:07.700
We just want to look at what's going to happen.

07:07.700 --> 07:09.560
The key is that one is positive.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.010
The other one is negative.

07:11.030 --> 07:11.210
All right.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.140
So what happens to the potential energy.

07:14.150 --> 07:19.370
Well as they get closer remember there's a force acting on and they are attracted to each other.

07:19.790 --> 07:21.770
So they're going to move closer together.

07:21.770 --> 07:25.530
So at some point they're going to look like this.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.800
So they're going to get closer.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.900
Right the distance are here is going to get smaller.

07:29.970 --> 07:31.410
Here it was kind of big.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.230
Right.

07:33.390 --> 07:33.570
All right.

07:33.570 --> 07:37.720
So they get closer let's call this are 1 and are 2.

07:38.610 --> 07:43.280
So the potential energy in the first case over here if you think about it how do we write it down.

07:43.280 --> 07:52.110
It's K Q1 Q2 and this one here would be a positive one negative one and divided by our one.

07:52.790 --> 07:58.650
Here I would get negative K over R1 I could get a number for that for example but notice that it is

07:58.650 --> 08:00.540
negative and that's important right.

08:02.610 --> 08:04.530
So I start off with some negative value.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.500
That's my initial potential energy.

08:07.530 --> 08:14.640
What about my final potential energy final potential energy is again k 1 minus one what happens to our

08:14.640 --> 08:21.210
two imagine our one is put a number in there what if this is ten right ten meters apart let's get rid

08:21.210 --> 08:27.620
of this one if I write this as ten and in this case here what if I write this as one meter.

08:27.650 --> 08:27.810
Right.

08:27.810 --> 08:29.990
So they're getting close together won't be just one.

08:30.690 --> 08:33.900
So at the end here you get minus K over 1.

08:34.050 --> 08:35.900
So you notice that this is.

08:36.180 --> 08:36.870
All right.

08:36.870 --> 08:39.900
This guy here is is more negative.

08:39.930 --> 08:40.290
All right.

08:40.380 --> 08:41.850
This guy here is more negative

08:44.610 --> 08:46.650
so we notice that it is smaller.

08:46.770 --> 08:49.470
If something is more negative it is smaller.

08:50.400 --> 08:56.140
So that means that the potential energy is actually getting more negative which means it's decreasing.

08:56.160 --> 08:56.420
All right.

08:56.420 --> 08:59.800
So it's not increasing it's decreasing right here.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.200
It's kind of a little tricky.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.320
Now if there's a force acting on it all what happens.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.150
They start to accelerate.

09:06.150 --> 09:07.090
Right.

09:07.140 --> 09:08.870
That's given by cool ohms Laura for.

09:08.870 --> 09:14.280
So it'd be k Q1 Q2 divided by our 1 squared.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.520
What would it be down over here.

09:15.520 --> 09:20.790
It would be k Q1 Q2 divided by R2 squared.

09:20.850 --> 09:23.540
Notice that the distance is smaller over here.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.170
So the force would be bigger.

09:25.170 --> 09:30.730
Whatever force you have here this force is bigger this force here is smaller.

09:31.040 --> 09:37.380
So a smaller force because the distance changes bigger force.

09:37.460 --> 09:37.700
All right.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.980
So the acceleration doesn't decrease.

09:39.980 --> 09:40.410
Right.

09:40.490 --> 09:44.150
If the force is getting bigger it means the acceleration is increasing.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.100
So can't be that one.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.600
All right what about the energy concept.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.030
What do you think happens to the kinetic energy.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.420
Does it increase or decrease.

09:51.420 --> 09:54.760
Well again it should increase if things are moving faster.

09:54.800 --> 09:58.670
The kinetic energy should increase and it definitely doesn't decrease.

09:58.700 --> 09:58.910
OK.

09:58.940 --> 10:05.770
So that's kind of how I would argue all of this one for a problem for right here's problem five.

10:05.770 --> 10:10.680
We have a region of space that has a uniform electric field that is constant.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.450
It points from the left to the right as shown in the figure.

10:14.170 --> 10:16.280
Which statement is correct.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.050
All right.

10:17.200 --> 10:23.020
The potential out of all these three points is the same or the potential at a and b are the same and

10:23.020 --> 10:33.460
c is at high higher potential a B or the same potential that C is lower or a B A is higher than B and

10:33.460 --> 10:34.060
so forth.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.450
Choice D right here.

10:35.680 --> 10:40.030
So one thing they tell us is that the field is uniform.

10:40.090 --> 10:44.200
Well let's think about what would produce a uniform electric field right here.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.870
What would what would this side look like versus this side.

10:49.150 --> 10:53.250
Again this looks like a parallel plate capacitor to me.

10:53.380 --> 10:58.960
So that means that this side here would be positive and this side here would be negatively charged that

10:58.960 --> 11:02.850
would produce an electric field that goes like this.

11:02.860 --> 11:10.060
So for example this side here might be at 10 volts and this side here might be at negative 10 volts.

11:10.240 --> 11:15.180
The center in that case would be zero volts.

11:15.190 --> 11:23.530
We know that the electric field tells us how the voltage changes with respect to the position.

11:23.710 --> 11:25.450
Now if this is constant

11:28.970 --> 11:35.640
that means that the voltage varies with the distance has a constant slope.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.680
That means I go from plus 10 to negative 10.

11:39.050 --> 11:41.220
In kind of a straight line all right.

11:41.360 --> 11:48.830
If you were going to actually make a plot of voltage versus position Well I would start over here at

11:48.830 --> 11:55.160
10 Volts and I would end up at negative 10 volts once I reach the other plate.

11:55.210 --> 11:59.850
Imagine the other plate finishes here so this would be a graph like this.

11:59.930 --> 12:05.420
The slope of that line would give us the electric field right here and you'd also be at 0 volts right

12:05.420 --> 12:06.850
at the center.

12:06.980 --> 12:11.080
So that means that remember we also talked about the equal potential.

12:11.360 --> 12:17.480
If electric field lines are going like this it means that the equal potential lines have to look like

12:17.480 --> 12:17.870
this.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.300
This might be 9 Volts.

12:20.400 --> 12:27.190
The center here you might get 5 volts right 0 volts at the center.

12:27.590 --> 12:33.690
Negative 5 volts write down some values here as I get closer I am approaching negative 10.

12:34.220 --> 12:38.270
So again these are equal potential lines we call those equal potentials

12:41.350 --> 12:41.650
okay.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.350
So kind of different ways of looking at it.

12:43.350 --> 12:49.910
So that means that a and b would be at the same potential and C would be at a lower electrical potential.

12:49.950 --> 12:52.680
So definitely not the same everywhere.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.390
Okay a and b are equal.

12:54.390 --> 12:56.070
That's fine.

12:56.070 --> 12:57.880
The potential at point C is higher.

12:57.880 --> 13:03.630
No we just said it has to be lower because the electric field is pointing that way.

13:03.660 --> 13:06.660
Potential C is lower this one here makes sense to me.

13:06.660 --> 13:12.900
Let's look at choice D the potential potential at Point A is highest low A and B have to be at the same

13:12.900 --> 13:14.130
potential.

13:15.270 --> 13:20.700
So kind of a little bit of a tricky question also but again using the concept of equal potential lines

13:21.030 --> 13:27.610
they have to be perpendicular to the electric field perpendicular to E field.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.380
All right that's it for the quiz guys hopefully you understood some of this.
