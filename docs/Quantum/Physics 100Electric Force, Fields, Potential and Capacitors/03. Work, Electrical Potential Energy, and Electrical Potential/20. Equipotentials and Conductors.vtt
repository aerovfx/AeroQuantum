00:00.330 --> 00:00.900
All right.

00:00.980 --> 00:06.080
The last thing I want to say for this electrical potential right here is let's revisit our conductors.

00:06.420 --> 00:12.070
If you remember if I had a conductor for example a piece of copper right.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.220
Well and if I charged it up for example if I remove some of the free electrons here.

00:17.250 --> 00:23.610
Well that means that if you remember that charge would have to be at the surface and if it has an odd

00:23.610 --> 00:26.520
shape it's not going to be evenly distributed.

00:26.520 --> 00:33.960
You tend to have a little bit more charge near the sharp edges and fewer charges kind of along the straighter

00:33.960 --> 00:35.160
sections.

00:35.190 --> 00:46.920
But let me draw some positive charges remember that the charges are at the surface for conductors.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.780
What else do we say about conductors.

00:48.780 --> 00:52.150
There was something really really special about inside the conductor.

00:52.170 --> 00:52.920
Right.

00:53.070 --> 00:59.040
The electric field inside although you'd have to calculate it from all of these charges at the end if

00:59.040 --> 01:00.270
you did it carefully.

01:00.270 --> 01:05.380
You'd have to get that the electric field inside is equal to zero.

01:05.390 --> 01:09.800
Well let's think about what that means if it's zero and let's think about it maybe just in terms of

01:10.190 --> 01:13.190
this one corner right here.

01:13.340 --> 01:20.860
That means that if I go from this point that this point is zero over here and it's zero over here this

01:20.860 --> 01:23.610
could be an initial position this could be some final position right.

01:23.620 --> 01:31.090
As I move from one to the other there is no electric field what what would that mean in terms of the

01:31.090 --> 01:33.990
electrical potential again.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.450
If you think about what the definition is it would be that change in the voltage over the change in

01:40.630 --> 01:43.650
x positions right here.

01:43.680 --> 01:52.810
Now if my electric field inside we just said was zero what does that mean and how do I get to zero from

01:52.840 --> 01:55.040
the right hand side of this expression.

01:55.210 --> 02:02.740
This is v final minus V initial and over the change in x that's right here x final minus X initial.

02:02.740 --> 02:10.660
The only way I can have that the only way I can get zero right here is if both of these guys are actually

02:10.720 --> 02:18.690
equal to each other I can only get zero if the initial voltage is the voltage at this point is actually

02:18.750 --> 02:23.340
equal to the voltage at that point.

02:23.450 --> 02:25.880
That's the only way I can have that.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.650
And now you can make the argument if he is inside.

02:28.670 --> 02:32.940
Well I could choose points going in the opposite direction right now.

02:32.980 --> 02:34.970
And I chose these two points.

02:34.970 --> 02:38.580
This would be some initial why this would be some final why.

02:38.720 --> 02:44.630
Again if the field is zero inside there's no electric field component in the vertical direction here.

02:44.690 --> 02:50.990
The only way I could have that is if the voltage here has to be equal to the voltage here.

02:51.110 --> 02:53.000
They must be equal to each other.

02:53.210 --> 02:57.260
And you could do that for every single point inside this conductor.

02:57.320 --> 03:03.170
So at the end what this means is that the entire conductor is on every potential

03:05.910 --> 03:10.460
this entire conductor is at the same voltage.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.980
That's the only way.

03:12.030 --> 03:14.880
That same voltage.

03:15.420 --> 03:21.360
So if I remove some electrons it would probably add some positive voltage for example it could be at

03:21.360 --> 03:28.180
20 volts it's 20 volts everywhere inside this conductor it has to be the same.

03:28.180 --> 03:34.990
Otherwise we would have an electric field if it was 20 volts over here and 10 volts right here I would

03:34.990 --> 03:38.930
have a variation of voltage with space but I can't have that.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.430
I do require that the electric feel inside a conductor is always zero.
