# Work and Potential Energy Part 3

## 03. Work, Electrical Potential Energy, and Electrical Potential

### Tóm tắt nội dung

We just looked at two examples of the work done and the work done by hằng số các lực I can't emphasize this enough guy Vậy hằng số các lực were gravity. This applied lực. Maybe the work done by the điện trường or by the lực điện between các bản song song. Bây giờ if you think about it Bây giờ when you do work like Trong trường hợp này my applied lực did 150 miles of work. What we say Bây giờ is that when there is energy put into the system we say that at the end chúng ta có stored some thế energy in the system Vậy stored some thế energy. We Bây giờ say that this 10 kg of 10 kg mass has gravitational thế energy. That's what we say Đúng here Đúng. We say there is rather Asian traditional thế energy and you have thế energy when something did work. We did 150 miles of work. OK Vậy the amount of thế energy that chúng ta có our final thế energy that we had usually typically use the letter you for this guy was equal to again the lực was M.G. and the height was H. OK. But this was really the work that was done by this lực to lift the block. Bây giờ you may have seen this phương trình before for gravitational thế energy the energy of mass. That is a certain height above the ground ví dụ. And that's how much work was done in order to lift this mass. Vậy Bây giờ if I go back to the điện trường example well the same concept applies. I would say that we did how many jewels of work we ended up doing 20 jewels of work in order to move a to cool ohm điện tích all the way to the top. Well in other words once it's at the top Đúng here in this top position I would say chúng ta có stored some thế energy except Trong trường hợp này we're going to call it electrical thế energy write this down. It's very very important because work was done work was done on the điện tích on the system. Vậy therefore Bây giờ I'm storing some electrical thế energy into the system. Trong trường hợp này the amount of thế energy that I've stored into the system again it was the lực this was the điện tích multiplied by the field and multiplied by the khoảng cách D. And notice I had a positive number over here for my final thế energy and that was equal to 20 joules that's how much thế energy I have in the system Đúng Bây giờ.
