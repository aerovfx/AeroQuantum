WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:02.340
We just saw that four point charges.

00:02.340 --> 00:04.580
This is what the electrical potential is.

00:04.650 --> 00:06.730
And again it is a scalar quantity.

00:06.730 --> 00:06.920
All right.

00:06.930 --> 00:08.690
We can't forget that.

00:08.830 --> 00:15.810
And if I was three meters away I calculated that the potential at this point relative to this one is

00:15.810 --> 00:17.720
six thousand volts.

00:17.730 --> 00:23.490
Let's have a look at my equation over here first of all what happens if our goes all the way to infinity

00:23.500 --> 00:25.570
if I'm very very far away.

00:25.650 --> 00:31.080
If you look at my equation right here I have my k constant the charge and now I'm dividing by a really

00:31.080 --> 00:32.500
big number.

00:32.550 --> 00:38.850
So in this limit what we would find is that the potential actually would tend towards zero volts when

00:38.850 --> 00:41.160
you're really really far away.

00:41.190 --> 00:43.300
This is for a single point charge.

00:43.560 --> 00:52.190
If my point P was located over here and guess what if it was still three meters away if my distance

00:52.190 --> 00:55.290
is three meters I would say that.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.160
Well guess what.

00:56.190 --> 01:02.740
The potential since it's a scalar the voltage right here is six thousand volts.

01:03.510 --> 01:08.760
Again I could draw a circle or actually a if it was like in three dimensions right.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.130
You could draw a circle around this charge and everywhere.

01:13.130 --> 01:16.970
This is not the best one but close enough a little closer on this side.

01:17.080 --> 01:17.220
Right.

01:17.220 --> 01:24.500
But everywhere on this path you would find that the voltage is six thousand volts.

01:24.690 --> 01:32.990
If I put a point over here and that distance again is three meters from the point charge you would write

01:32.990 --> 01:37.680
the voltage is equal to six thousand.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.820
All right what about now.

01:38.820 --> 01:41.160
If I had an inner sphere right.

01:41.460 --> 01:44.270
If I have an inner sphere that is closer.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.520
What if my sphere is something like this.

01:48.000 --> 01:48.310
Right.

01:48.350 --> 01:53.660
In this case here the radius is just one meter.

01:53.700 --> 01:58.390
What would be the voltage over here on this position right here.

01:58.390 --> 02:02.580
Well again all you would have to do is you use my equation same equation right.

02:03.360 --> 02:08.160
Let's do it an orange since we're calculating the voltage everywhere on the sphere you'd right at the

02:08.160 --> 02:12.570
voltage is K the constant nine times 10 to the nine.

02:12.570 --> 02:19.260
All right the charge is still to micro cool arms that's two times 10 to the negative six and divided

02:19.260 --> 02:21.420
by one meter in this case.

02:21.420 --> 02:21.650
All right.

02:21.660 --> 02:26.590
So here you would get eighteen thousand volts.

02:26.630 --> 02:32.220
I notice that the electrical potential is bigger as I go closer to positive charges.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.740
Let me write that down on the figure here.

02:35.760 --> 02:36.120
All right.

02:36.150 --> 02:42.000
So anyway that's pretty straightforward as I go farther away the potential gets smaller when I'm really

02:42.000 --> 02:45.810
really far away the potential is zero volts.

02:45.870 --> 02:46.110
All right.

02:46.110 --> 02:52.260
Now let's consider what happens if I have a negative charge over here what is the electrical potential

02:52.260 --> 02:54.660
produced by negative charges.

02:54.660 --> 02:56.380
So let me kind of make some room over here.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.330
Let's consider a slightly different situation again.

02:59.340 --> 03:03.210
There are always going to be point charges.

03:03.210 --> 03:03.540
All right.

03:03.570 --> 03:07.950
So let's go ahead with this one let's produce one point charge here right at the center.

03:07.980 --> 03:14.130
I'm going to say it's a negative charge and the magnitude of that charge is going to be CU negative

03:14.150 --> 03:16.330
1 micro cooling.

03:16.350 --> 03:16.550
All right.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.720
So we have a negative value here.

03:18.720 --> 03:25.630
Well let's go see if I am a distance of let's say one meter away.

03:25.650 --> 03:30.480
This is my distance are in this case is one meter.

03:30.530 --> 03:34.100
What is the voltage everywhere on this sphere.

03:34.100 --> 03:39.650
Well again you just use the equation now again since it's a scalar quantity the important thing is that

03:39.920 --> 03:43.790
we actually substitute in the negative value for the charge.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.190
So the K value is nine times 10 to the nine.

03:48.350 --> 03:53.260
The charge now is negative 1 times 10 to the negative 6.

03:53.270 --> 03:58.370
And if I am one meter away from that charge then I'm just dividing by 1.

03:58.400 --> 04:05.540
So at the end the voltage for this case here has to be negative nine thousand volts.

04:05.570 --> 04:05.900
All right.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.760
So this is what the voltage is everywhere on this sphere.

04:11.850 --> 04:14.320
Now how about if I go a little bit further away again.

04:14.340 --> 04:17.400
What if I go three meters away from this charge.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.610
You try to draw a better sphere this is a sphere.

04:22.920 --> 04:27.090
Again in this case I don't have to do the calculation really fast all I have to do now is divide this

04:27.090 --> 04:28.560
number by three.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.220
So what do we get.

04:29.250 --> 04:36.120
We're going to get negative three thousand volts and again in this case this sphere is a distance R

04:36.120 --> 04:43.830
which is equal to three meters away so the closer I get the more negative it becomes the farther I get

04:43.830 --> 04:44.090
again.

04:44.100 --> 04:49.780
It's going to approach zero but it approaches it from the negative side okay.

04:51.320 --> 04:57.500
Now these surfaces here notice that everywhere on here I'm going to get negative three thousand volts

04:58.370 --> 05:00.160
everywhere on the orange one.

05:00.200 --> 05:05.000
Doesn't matter if it's on this side if it's on this side since I'm always the same distance I'm always

05:05.000 --> 05:12.870
going to get nine thousand volts these surfaces are given a very very special name since they have these

05:12.870 --> 05:17.000
same potential the same voltage everywhere.

05:17.420 --> 05:27.540
You write this down if they have the same potential we call these equal potentials so let's try that

05:27.540 --> 05:31.840
again equal potential.

05:32.340 --> 05:35.280
These are equal potential surfaces.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.320
OK.

05:36.460 --> 05:41.580
Now what would happen if I place a place another charge here.

05:41.580 --> 05:49.950
Let's Plays a two micro cool home charge right here on this equal potential that's negative nine thousand

05:49.950 --> 05:51.450
volts.

05:51.450 --> 05:56.510
What is the potential energy of the system if I place another charge here.

05:56.550 --> 06:03.680
Now you could go and start by calculating K Q1 Q2 over ah you could do that.

06:03.720 --> 06:10.440
However if we know the voltage at this specific position in space right away I can calculate what is

06:10.440 --> 06:16.750
the potential energy because it's simply the charge multiplied by the voltage at that specific spot.

06:17.520 --> 06:22.660
So in this case it's two micro cooling two times 10 to the negative six.

06:22.830 --> 06:23.410
And what else.

06:23.420 --> 06:27.180
What's multiplied by the voltage and again it's negative nine thousand.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.040
It's important to keep the negative sign there.

06:30.210 --> 06:33.630
So the potential energy can be positive it can be negative.

06:33.720 --> 06:41.220
In this case here I'm going to get negative 18 multiplied by ten to the negative six oh so I tend to

06:41.220 --> 06:46.260
the negative three rather let's try that again.

06:46.350 --> 06:46.550
All right.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.810
And that is measured in Joules.

06:49.900 --> 06:54.880
All right if I take the same charge and I place it over here on this equal potential.

06:55.020 --> 07:01.240
So again I'm going to place a positive to micro cool erm charge I can easily calculate what is the potential

07:01.240 --> 07:09.670
energy of the system because I have a negative charge that produces a voltage of negative three thousand

07:09.670 --> 07:10.090
over here.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.560
So let's do the calculation.

07:11.740 --> 07:18.910
So the potential energy right here or of the system rather is simply going to be Q multiplied by the

07:18.910 --> 07:25.720
voltage again two times 10 to the negative six is the charge that I'm placing here and the voltage we

07:25.720 --> 07:31.270
said we calculated this was an equal potential of 3000 volts.

07:31.420 --> 07:39.440
So at the end you're going to get negative six and times tend to the negative three if you work it out

07:39.550 --> 07:41.200
Jules.

07:41.840 --> 07:47.690
So this kind of formula right here is so practical especially if you know the voltage or the scalar

07:47.690 --> 07:49.400
field everywhere in space.
