# Equipotentials for an Electric Dipole

## 03. Work, Electrical Potential Energy, and Electrical Potential

### Tóm tắt nội dung

We previously looked at the electric lưỡng cực and here it is again this electric lưỡng cực is made from a positive điện tích and one negative điện tích. The magnitudes of those điện tích are minus one nano cool and plus one for the positive. And again they're separated by a certain khoảng cách. The white arrows represent the điện trường véctơ is at different positions. If I was gonna draw the field lines they would look like this. You remember what they look like. Something like this. Try to draw them accurately. Again you kind of have to trace out or make sure that the lines go through those vectors like this. I'm only going to draw some of them Đúng here. Maybe one more down here at the bottom Được rồi. This is what the điện trường lines look like the vectors are just the white arrows Đúng here. And again there's other ones over here. I could extend that like this and maybe have other field lines that end on the negative các điện tích. Được rồi that's what the sketch looks like. The green lines represent the equip potentials again and I wrote just some of them. Let me go ahead and fill this out. These are the equip thế surfaces. I think I started out at 20 Vôn 10 Vôn 5 Vôn and 2.5 Vôn negative on this side Vậy negative 2.5 Vôn positive 2.5 Vôn positive 5 Vôn negative 5 Vôn and you could see what they look like again. Let me just trace out one of them. The line Đúng in the center Đúng here. This is 0 Vôn Đúng there is a 0 volt aquÃ­ thế for this electric lưỡng cực. And that is because again if you imagine just one particular point up here Đúng. chúng ta có two contributions chúng ta có the positive one which is a certain khoảng cách away and we also have the negative one which is a certain khoảng cách away. When you add both of those contributions up you're going to get zero Vôn everywhere along that line. Again as I start moving closer to the positive I'm starting to get positive electrical thế. This here was 10 Vôn Được rồi what else. Twenty Vôn ups say 20 and I Đúng 30 20 Vôn Được rồi and negative is on the other side. Được. Vậy again the key that we're going to notice is that the echoey potentials again these guys here they are perpendicular to the điện trường lines everywhere Đúng. They're never parallel to the field lines. The other thing you could see again when you go from positive electrical thế toward negative electrical thế Đúng the field lines always go from high hiệu điện thế toward low hiệu điện thế. Được. Vậy again you could see those properties and it really doesn't matter how complicated the field looks like even if I added other point các điện tích out here in space I would still get the same result. Được Vậy we're gonna go look at the mathematical link Bây giờ between them and why do we always get this relationship Đúng here. Được. But this is the example for the electric lưỡng cực. And again you could see that relationship hold nicely.
