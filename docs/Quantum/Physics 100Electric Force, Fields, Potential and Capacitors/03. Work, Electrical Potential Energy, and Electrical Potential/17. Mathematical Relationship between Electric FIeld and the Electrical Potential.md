# Mathematical Relationship between Electric FIeld and the Electrical Potential

## 03. Work, Electrical Potential Energy, and Electrical Potential

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Đúng I Bây giờ want to do is just look at the mathematical relationship between the điện trường and the electrical thế. We saw the connection four point các điện tích electric fuel's point out radiantly away from the point điện tích and the equip thế services were perpendicular to those field lines. And I also show you for the lưỡng cực the same thing happens the field is more complicated but the equip potentials were always perpendicular to those. Vậy remember the field lines always go from high thế toward low thế. Vậy you need the electrical thế to change for there to be an điện trường. Được rồi. Vậy let's look at that and then we're going to apply our phương trình to look at các bản song song. That was the other configuration where we looked at the điện trường. That case is a mathematically a little bit simpler because we said if chúng ta có các bản song song THE điện trường IS hằng số. Đúng. It goes from the positive plate toward the negative plate. Let's see what điều đó có nghĩa là in terms of the electrical thế in terms of the hiệu điện thế Được rồi. Vậy here is the expression over here and I'm just gonna write it down as the độ lớn and let's xem xét a place where the hiệu điện thế varies linearly in space. The way you would write this here is minus the change of hiệu điện thế over a change in spatial coordinate. Vậy here's the situation I'm describing. Let's see something like this. This is my x axis and for Bây giờ let's just take these are we thế surfaces and let's assume that they kind of look like this and take this here to be kind of 50 Vôn maybe twenty five Vôn 0 Vôn and negative twenty five Vôn. Được. The spacing here could be kind of 0 meters one meter two meter three meters and Vậy forth. If I wanted to evaluate the điện trường again there's only gonna be an điện trường in this hướng because that is where the hiệu điện thế is changing. There is Không component of the điện trường that has to be up and down. Đúng you can't have this because the hiệu điện thế doesn't change along that hướng Đúng here. Được rồi. Vậy let me just get rid of that. Được rồi. Vậy we will have an điện trường that goes like this. And if it varies linearly with khoảng cách again I could choose kind of this point and this point. Vậy there are different voltages and they're separated by a certain khoảng cách. Vậy if I wanted to find the điện trường Trong trường hợp này again the Deltas are always a final value minus an initial value. And again this is going to be my final position minus my initial position. Vậy let's go ahead and do that Vậy we get minus. Vậy the final hiệu điện thế let's take this point over here Vậy we get minus 25 and minus the initial hiệu điện thế This is 50. Được. And all of this divided by the change of space here. This is at three meters that's the final and minus zero meters like this. OK. Vậy if you look at this term is 75 or negative 75 multiplied by that one becomes 75 over three. Trong trường hợp này we get 25 and this is measured in Vôn per meter. OK Vậy the điện trường would be 25 Vôn per meter OK. Notice we get a positive number. Positive number is indicative of some that point toward the positive x hướng Đúng here. OK. Vậy that here is the điện trường độ lớn for that hướng. Được rồi what I said was kind of an approximation in reality really what you want to do is if you want to find the điện trường this is kind of how it's represented here. Bây giờ this looks rather complicated. This here is called a gradient. And I'll định nghĩa it what it is in just a second Vậy I can write this a gradient here as a partial derivative. Vậy it's only along one hướng here of the hiệu điện thế and that gives me the component of the field along the x hướng. Được. But I could have in general the hiệu điện thế that varies in other directions. Vậy actually the gradient Đúng here actually has three components if I write it in Cartesian coordinates. If the hiệu điện thế varies in the y hướng again I'm going to have a y component of the điện trường. This is what I would call E Y and the last term you can also have spatial variation of the hiệu điện thế again along the z hướng. And this is what would be called the Z component of the điện trường for the case that I considered earlier this is if I'm working in Cartesian coordinates for the point điện tích that I considered earlier we know that the độ lớn of the hiệu điện thế from a certain point away the hiệu điện thế I can write out as k q over are Được. The way that you would write down the điện trường for this case again I would have to write out this gradient here in spherical coordinates. Again this is kind of mathematical but the only component that I'm going to get here is how does the hiệu điện thế change as a function of khoảng cách away from the điện tích. Được rồi. And while I'm gonna write this as k q and I'll bring the R to the top and I can do that as long as I just change the exponent to a negative. And how do you take a derivative of this function. This is pretty straightforward. You get minus one from the exponent. This is K Q and it becomes R to the minus two. Bây giờ can't forget the other negative sine I have there Vậy that actually converts that one into a positive Đúng and Bây giờ the hướng of this is always kind of pointing away Trong trường hợp này. Được Vậy that is how you would evaluate it for this point điện tích. Vậy at the end the expression that I get at least for the full véctơ Đúng here would be k q I'll bring the r square at the bottom and again it's pointing away from that point điện tích. Vậy at any point again my điện trường kind of looks like this. Vậy this expression here is sort more like this one here. This is more for spherical. And this here is more for Cartesian coordinates. Được rồi your class might not be going into this level of detail here but the key is that as long as you have hiệu điện thế that changes in space you're going to have an điện trường.
