00:00.180 --> 00:07.500
So so far we've focused on concepts that involve vectors some of the vectors that we've looked at so

00:07.500 --> 00:11.190
far were the force vector given by cool Ohm's Law.

00:11.190 --> 00:16.200
For example if I want to calculate the magnitude we've also looked at the electric field produced by

00:16.200 --> 00:21.530
point charges maybe by sheets of charges or by wires.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.770
And those were linked together by this simple formula.

00:24.780 --> 00:25.010
Right.

00:25.010 --> 00:28.810
Simply the charge multiplied by the electric field.

00:28.830 --> 00:29.000
All right.

00:29.010 --> 00:36.960
What I now want to do is I want to develop some problem solving approaches that involves scales and

00:36.960 --> 00:40.290
scalar as will be related to the concept of energy.

00:41.850 --> 00:45.150
So the basic property of those is they're just numbers right.

00:45.150 --> 00:49.440
We don't have any direction so simple numbers no direction.

00:51.270 --> 00:56.850
So in some ways it is a little bit easier to solve problems like that.

00:57.060 --> 00:57.600
All right.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.820
The first concept that I want to just kind of remind ourselves is something called work.

01:01.830 --> 01:07.610
This is going to be important when we deal with problems solving haven't do it charges.

01:07.620 --> 01:11.200
Let me start by just the simple definition of work.

01:11.370 --> 01:17.440
It's called sorry it's defined as the force a scalar product with a displacement.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.320
And I'll illustrate what that means.

01:19.320 --> 01:29.310
Now this formula right here that I write is only true for constant forces so only true for constant

01:29.310 --> 01:30.030
forces

01:32.800 --> 01:40.140
when the force changes for example for new for cool arms law we saw that the force depends on the distance.

01:40.210 --> 01:46.120
I wouldn't be able to use this equation to calculate the work done but if the force is constant like

01:46.120 --> 01:51.220
a charge between parallel plates typically the force is constant so let's have a look at this in more

01:51.220 --> 01:52.240
detail.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.830
This is a scalar product

01:57.250 --> 02:02.500
and the way that you can write down a scalar product again I would write simply that the work again

02:02.500 --> 02:08.650
if the magnitude of the force I'll just call it force it's the magnitude of the displacement and it's

02:08.650 --> 02:11.350
coercive the angle between both of those.

02:12.130 --> 02:18.940
So if we take a couple of cases for example if I have a force F which is in this direction and I have

02:18.940 --> 02:22.700
a displacement which is also in this direction.

02:23.080 --> 02:28.360
In that case here the angle theta would be equal to zero because there's no angle between both of those

02:28.360 --> 02:29.420
vectors.

02:29.470 --> 02:35.730
So this here would represent a case where somebody might be pushing a crate along the floor.

02:35.740 --> 02:43.470
So here's a crate resting on the floor and I apply a force to it in order to move it.

02:43.600 --> 02:47.460
So in this case here I'm applying a force and I want to move it a certain distance.

02:47.470 --> 02:51.970
Delta X again the displacement is also to the right in this case.

02:52.190 --> 02:54.920
So that would represent this one.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.440
There's another way I can move that crate.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.990
What if I have a force that's actually pushing down a little bit.

03:01.140 --> 03:01.420
Right.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.980
Again imagine we have again a same crate.

03:05.440 --> 03:13.600
I could push that crate and move it along the floor even if I apply a certain force at a distance like

03:13.600 --> 03:15.440
this it might be a little bit harder.

03:15.460 --> 03:21.060
However I'm still going to have a displacement and the displacement is still going to be this way.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.160
I'm gonna move the crate along the floor.

03:23.710 --> 03:29.200
So in this case if you draw those vectors end to end or starting at the same position here I'd have

03:29.200 --> 03:30.800
my force like this.

03:31.110 --> 03:32.770
So sorry forces at an angle.

03:32.770 --> 03:43.400
Try that again I'd have a force in this direction and my displacement is in this direction.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.980
That's my delta x.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.590
In this case here I have an angle theta between them.

03:49.690 --> 03:58.090
So if I wanted to calculate the work for this case I would say that the work is simply f delta x and

03:58.090 --> 04:02.030
then I would have to include this coast of the angle theta.

04:03.370 --> 04:04.900
So that's how that angle theta comes in.

04:04.900 --> 04:09.840
You could see that in some cases for the special case where theta is 90 degrees.

04:09.970 --> 04:12.300
There is no work being done by that force.

04:12.310 --> 04:22.570
So let's kind of highlight that right when theta equals the 90 that's the force is perpendicular to

04:22.570 --> 04:24.460
the displacement.

04:24.460 --> 04:27.800
In that case the work equals to 0.

04:28.120 --> 04:32.060
The units of work again it's a force times a distance.

04:32.080 --> 04:38.220
This actually ends up being units of joules and these are units of energy.
