# Electrical Potential and Electrical Potential Energy for Point Charges

## 03. Work, Electrical Potential Energy, and Electrical Potential

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Did this example in a previous video we tính toán the electrical thế energy. If I had a two micro cooling điện tích and a four micro cool ohm điện tích separated by three meters. Được rồi. Well again Bây giờ for there to be thế energy chúng ta cần both of these các điện tích to be there. And again this is a scalar quantity. This number could be positive if it was a positive a negative. We show examples where the thế energy could be negative. Được rồi Bây giờ the question is điều gì xảy ra nếu we only have one điện tích. Well if we only have one điện tích or we're gonna do is we're going to get rid of this one. Let's get rid of the four micro cooling for Bây giờ. Được rồi. Well if I only have one điện tích I mean I'm going to have to place some point here I'm going to call it a point P again if we only have one điện tích we don't have thế energy because there's only one điện tích. But again let's have a look at what the phương trình would look like if we only had one điện tích. Well Bây giờ I'm going to call this quantity V which is different and I'm going to keep everything else the same k q 1 and divided by R KS the same Q would be the độ lớn of this điện tích and R are Bây giờ has a different meaning Đúng. R is Bây giờ the khoảng cách from the điện tích to the point where I want to evaluate this quantity V. This is what we call the electrical thế. And it's the electrical thế produced by a point điện tích. It's also very important. OK. Vậy this is really this discussion I'm having here is four point các điện tích Vậy let's go ahead and tính toán this value Vậy we just substitute the values in there Đúng. chúng ta có nine times 10 to the nine I have q one which is to micro Coolum and what else. Bây giờ I have to divide by three and that's it. Vậy V at the end of the day is let me put that in the calculator nine. Each of the nine times to e to the negative six and divided by three. This gives me a number of six thousand. Bây giờ what are the units of this value. Well it's kind of like this phương trình and the thế energy was joules except I've removed one of the các điện tích. Được this is what we call a jewel per Coolum Đúng. Vậy this quantity V is how much energy you have per điện tích Vậy let's just write this down as a V. The units of it are in jewels per Coolum and this means it's energy that chúng ta có per unit điện tích. We simplify this. OK. We give this a special name. This is what we call a Volt. And this is something that we're a little bit more familiar in everyday life. You hear this term a lot. Vôn go Vôn is a unit of thế. Được. Vậy this is really really important. Vậy a lot of times I'm just gonna write sic V equals to six thousand Vôn Trong trường hợp này. That's it. That's the same thing. Vậy one jewel per cool ohm is equivalent to one volt. Vậy the question is Bây giờ all what if I know this electrical thế is six thousand Đúng here. That's what we just calculated. Well I'm going to go ahead Bây giờ and I'm going to place a nother điện tích Đúng here at this position. This điện tích is going to have a value of 4 micro cooling similar to what we did before. How could I tính toán what is the thế energy Bây giờ in the system using the fact that I know I have six thousand Vôn at that point. Vậy this is a really important phương trình Đúng here. I think about it here I can write that the thế energy is if you look at the first part of my thế energy Đúng here. This guy here is really what our volt phương trình was what the thế was do at the end. I can always write an electrical thế as a điện tích Trong trường hợp này if the điện tích for micro cooling multiplied by the electrical thế at that specific point. Vậy Trong trường hợp này the công thức would look like this I'm going to place a four micro cooling điện tích here 10 to the negative 6 and I'm placing it at a position where the hiệu điện thế or the electrical thế produced by this 2 Micro cooling điện tích is six thousand Vôn. I guess what we get at the end of the day we're going to get the same thing as we would is if we use the top phương trình Đúng here and this number was zero point zero to four and that answer has to be in units of joules that is the thế energy. Được rồi. Vậy we've used we've introduced this concept and it's actually a really powerful because if we know the electrical thế anywhere in space if we know it's six thousand it's very very easy to tính toán what the total energy is simply by multiplying by whatever điện tích chúng ta có here.
