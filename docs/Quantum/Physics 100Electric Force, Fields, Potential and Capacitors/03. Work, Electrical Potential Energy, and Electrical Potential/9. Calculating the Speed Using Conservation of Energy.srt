00:00.240 --> 00:00.450
All right.

00:00.450 --> 00:06.630
The big advantage of having a potential energy at our disposal and the fact that the electrical force

00:06.630 --> 00:14.490
is a conservative force is it allows us to use conservation of energy to solve problems.

00:14.520 --> 00:21.140
So let's consider the same problem a two and a four micro cooling charge separated by three meters.

00:21.150 --> 00:28.190
I said initially I'm going to have it like this so I have some electrical potential energy in the system.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.240
Now the two micro cool home charge is going to be fixed in this problem.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.680
And the four micro cooling charges free to move around.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.880
I'm going to release it from rest.

00:38.010 --> 00:42.780
And so it's going to start to accelerate because there's a force acting on it.

00:43.050 --> 00:47.000
And as it starts to accelerate it starts to speed up.

00:47.100 --> 00:47.370
Right.

00:47.370 --> 00:54.050
So it's going to start moving away and it's going to be increasing its speed faster and faster and faster.

00:54.300 --> 00:59.130
Eventually it's going to be really really far away from the two micro cooling charge.

00:59.130 --> 01:04.170
The question is now how fast is that charge moving when it's really really far away.

01:04.170 --> 01:10.860
Let's see how we can now use this concept and use conservation of total energy in order to solve a whole

01:10.860 --> 01:12.310
bunch of problems.

01:12.360 --> 01:18.030
So here's our example again we have to inform micro cool on this one is fixed and this one I'm going

01:18.030 --> 01:23.520
to release it from rest so right at this position I'd be able to calculate the force right just using

01:23.520 --> 01:29.010
cool Ohm's law all the distance I know the magnitude of the charge so I would get a force for example

01:29.010 --> 01:35.600
of X number of cool ohms X in the first Newton's actually acting on that charge.

01:35.670 --> 01:38.010
So it's going to start to speed up.

01:38.010 --> 01:44.010
The question I have is when it's really really far away down over here how fast is it moving.

01:44.010 --> 01:48.390
So in order to use this what we're going to use is conservation of total energy.

01:48.390 --> 01:48.650
OK.

01:48.690 --> 01:50.450
So let me go ahead write that.

01:50.760 --> 01:56.250
And the reason I can have conservation of total energy is because the electric force is a conservative

01:56.250 --> 01:56.970
force

01:59.880 --> 02:04.210
so the energy in this problem is made up of two different kinds.

02:04.380 --> 02:07.340
We're going to have electrical potential energy.

02:07.650 --> 02:13.530
And once it starts moving we're also going to have energy associated the motion and that is called kinetic

02:13.530 --> 02:14.690
energy.

02:14.760 --> 02:20.130
So this is what we do we have to define the initial position and the final position.

02:20.130 --> 02:26.880
So let me go ahead and call this the initial position and I'm going to call this here the final position

02:27.830 --> 02:32.490
and what I want to do is I want to write the total energy at each point.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.650
So the total energy for example initial has to be equal to the total energy at any other position.

02:40.650 --> 02:43.590
In this case it'll be the final.

02:43.980 --> 02:44.160
All right.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.620
The total energy is composed of two terms.

02:47.790 --> 02:53.400
It's going to be I'm going to move over here it's going to be the initial kinetic energy plus the initial

02:54.270 --> 02:56.160
electrical potential energy.

02:56.580 --> 03:04.440
And this here has to be equal to the final kinetic energy plus the final electrical potential energy.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.790
Now what I'm going to do now is substitute my equations in here.

03:07.860 --> 03:18.540
So what is the initial kinetic energy What's 1 1/2 and V initial squared plus what's the initial electrical

03:18.540 --> 03:19.470
potential energy.

03:20.010 --> 03:29.230
Well it's going to be k Q1 Q2 and divided by whatever the initial spacing was between them and this

03:29.230 --> 03:31.800
here has to be equal to the final kinetic energy

03:34.330 --> 03:37.270
plus the final potential energy

03:40.190 --> 03:41.820
divided by our final.

03:42.020 --> 03:45.030
All right now there's a lot of terms here that are going to be equal to zero.

03:45.050 --> 03:50.300
First of all if I'm initially at rest that means it's initially not moving.

03:50.300 --> 03:54.110
So that means that this term here has to be equal to zero.

03:54.170 --> 03:54.880
What else.

03:54.920 --> 04:01.460
Initially I have some potential energy I calculated that I actually have zero point to four jewels of

04:01.850 --> 04:08.540
electrical potential energy all of that now is eventually going to get converted into kinetic energy.

04:08.690 --> 04:11.280
And what happens when I'm really really far away.

04:11.300 --> 04:16.490
That means that the spacing between the charges basically tends toward infinity.

04:16.490 --> 04:21.580
So if I divide by something that's really really big this term here is going to go to zero.

04:21.590 --> 04:27.380
So here you're transferring all of this potential energy into kinetic energy.

04:27.380 --> 04:30.170
My goal is define how fast the charge is moving.

04:30.530 --> 04:35.750
So let's go over here and we have actually an expression that we could use.

04:35.750 --> 04:41.870
So again this whole term here is basically what I calculated before the zero point zero to four.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.650
So I'm actually just going to leave that number the way it is.

04:44.810 --> 04:48.320
And I want to get an expression for the speed using this.

04:48.410 --> 04:53.810
So if I bring the two on the other side and this is my initial potential energy I also have to get rid

04:53.810 --> 04:59.390
of the mass and then at the end I'll have to take the square root in order to get the expression for

04:59.390 --> 05:01.400
the speed.

05:01.490 --> 05:01.670
All right.

05:01.670 --> 05:04.320
Now we could substitute in all our numbers.

05:04.340 --> 05:11.150
So we have two zero point zero to four joules and the mass now is actually important.

05:11.160 --> 05:18.300
Now the mass of the particle I've given you right here is 1 times tend to the negative 6 kilograms.

05:18.320 --> 05:18.550
All right.

05:18.550 --> 05:23.630
We put everything in here you're gonna get a number that is should be around two hundred nineteen meters

05:23.630 --> 05:24.630
per second.

05:24.800 --> 05:24.960
Right.

05:24.950 --> 05:28.150
When I'm really really far away this is the answer I get.

05:28.310 --> 05:33.260
Now if I wasn't really really far away imagine I wanted to know how fast it's moving when it's six meters

05:33.260 --> 05:34.280
away.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.290
In that case I wouldn't be able to make this simplification right here.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.240
This term would not be equal to zero.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.310
So I'd have to keep that there.

05:42.380 --> 05:47.110
All right but this is how you can use conservation of energy now to solve problems.
