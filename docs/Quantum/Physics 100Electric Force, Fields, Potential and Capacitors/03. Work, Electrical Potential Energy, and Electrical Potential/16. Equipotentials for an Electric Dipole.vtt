00:00.120 --> 00:06.750
We previously looked at the electric dipole and here it is again this electric dipole is made from a

00:06.750 --> 00:11.430
positive charge and one negative charge.

00:11.430 --> 00:17.370
The magnitudes of those charge are minus one nano cool and plus one for the positive.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.850
And again they're separated by a certain distance.

00:20.940 --> 00:26.070
The white arrows represent the electric field vector is at different positions.

00:26.070 --> 00:28.670
If I was gonna draw the field lines they would look like this.

00:28.680 --> 00:29.910
You remember what they look like.

00:29.910 --> 00:31.460
Something like this.

00:31.620 --> 00:34.320
Try to draw them accurately.

00:34.350 --> 00:36.200
Again you kind of have to trace out

00:39.080 --> 00:42.100
or make sure that the lines go through those vectors like this.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.810
I'm only going to draw some of them right here.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.550
Maybe one more down here at the bottom all right.

00:50.550 --> 00:55.710
This is what the electric field lines look like the vectors are just the white arrows right here.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.150
And again there's other ones over here.

00:57.150 --> 01:05.080
I could extend that like this and maybe have other field lines that end on the negative charges.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.750
All right that's what the sketch looks like.

01:06.750 --> 01:14.760
The green lines represent the equip potentials again and I wrote just some of them.

01:14.760 --> 01:15.960
Let me go ahead and fill this out.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.640
These are the equip potential surfaces.

01:18.780 --> 01:29.190
I think I started out at 20 volts 10 volts 5 volts and 2.5 volts negative on this side so negative 2.5

01:29.190 --> 01:40.080
volts positive 2.5 volts positive 5 volts negative 5 volts and you could see what they look like again.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.730
Let me just trace out one of them.

01:41.730 --> 01:44.100
The line right in the center right here.

01:44.200 --> 01:50.300
This is 0 volts right there is a 0 volt aquÃ­ potential for this electric dipole.

01:51.090 --> 01:57.000
And that is because again if you imagine just one particular point up here right.

01:57.030 --> 02:03.150
We have two contributions we have the positive one which is a certain distance away and we also have

02:03.150 --> 02:06.030
the negative one which is a certain distance away.

02:06.120 --> 02:14.810
When you add both of those contributions up you're going to get zero volts everywhere along that line.

02:15.420 --> 02:22.480
Again as I start moving closer to the positive I'm starting to get positive electrical potential.

02:22.500 --> 02:27.300
This here was 10 volts All right what else.

02:27.300 --> 02:34.840
Twenty volts ups say 20 and I right 30 20 volts All right and negative is on the other side.

02:35.030 --> 02:35.550
Okay.

02:36.600 --> 02:44.070
So again the key that we're going to notice is that the echoey potentials again these guys here they

02:44.070 --> 02:50.480
are perpendicular to the electric field lines everywhere right.

02:50.490 --> 02:54.650
They're never parallel to the field lines.

02:54.670 --> 03:00.730
The other thing you could see again when you go from positive electrical potential toward negative electrical

03:00.730 --> 03:06.810
potential right the field lines always go from high voltage toward low voltage.

03:06.810 --> 03:07.230
Okay.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.860
So again you could see those properties and it really doesn't matter how complicated the field looks

03:11.860 --> 03:17.400
like even if I added other point charges out here in space I would still get the same result.

03:17.410 --> 03:22.450
Okay so we're gonna go look at the mathematical link now between them and why do we always get this

03:22.450 --> 03:24.130
relationship right here.

03:24.240 --> 03:24.560
Okay.

03:24.790 --> 03:27.640
But this is the example for the electric dipole.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.310
And again you could see that relationship hold nicely.
