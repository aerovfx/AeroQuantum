00:00.120 --> 00:00.320
All right.

00:00.330 --> 00:04.440
Let's have a look at parallel plates now parallel plates we've spent quite a bit of time looking at

00:04.440 --> 00:05.130
them.

00:05.130 --> 00:11.850
So let's assume that our top plate is positively charged and our bottom plate is negatively charged

00:11.850 --> 00:15.500
and these plates are separated by five centimeters.

00:15.510 --> 00:15.720
All right.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.980
One thing I know is that the electric field produced by parallel plates.

00:19.980 --> 00:25.560
Again if you're more or less in the center of the plates the electric field is uniform it's constant

00:25.560 --> 00:26.550
everywhere.

00:26.630 --> 00:26.930
Right.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.600
And it goes from positive toward negative.

00:29.600 --> 00:35.330
So this would be the electric field that would be the direction like this.

00:35.340 --> 00:40.710
So again if I wanted to let's assume here that we have a Y axis like this.

00:41.760 --> 00:47.310
Let's take this plate here to be at zero and this played here to be at positive five centimeters.

00:47.370 --> 00:47.640
All right.

00:47.670 --> 00:53.650
So my definition for electric field if I wanted to calculate it again it would be.

00:53.940 --> 00:58.140
What is the change of voltage relative to the change in position.

00:58.780 --> 00:59.500
OK.

00:59.670 --> 01:09.380
So again it's going to be the final minus V initial divided by in this case it's Y final minus Y initial.

01:09.450 --> 01:09.720
Okay.

01:09.750 --> 01:14.820
So that's what's going to be my final and my initial really doesn't matter this could be my initial

01:14.820 --> 01:16.650
and this here could be my final.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.140
Okay.

01:18.810 --> 01:27.770
So my final voltage is 30 volts minus the initial voltage which is negative 30 volts.

01:28.010 --> 01:29.170
OK.

01:29.210 --> 01:32.270
The final position is five centimeters

01:35.510 --> 01:39.440
five times tend to the negative two and minus zero.

01:39.470 --> 01:39.710
OK.

01:39.740 --> 01:44.770
So let's evaluate this determine the bracket over here it gives me positive 60 volts.

01:44.780 --> 01:50.180
That's the difference in voltage between the top and the bottom and there's a negative there.

01:50.180 --> 01:50.390
Right.

01:50.390 --> 01:58.980
So I should get negative 60 and divided by five times 10 to the negative two.

01:58.990 --> 01:59.240
OK.

01:59.330 --> 02:07.190
So to do this math here I would do kind of five over maybe 100 something like this and 60 over five

02:07.190 --> 02:09.730
gives me twelve.

02:09.740 --> 02:16.040
All right I think I did the math correctly or I should get 12 hundred and this would be volts per meter.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.970
Now this is really a field in the y direction.

02:19.210 --> 02:25.100
So the electric field in the y direction notice I get a negative sine the negative sine is simply telling

02:25.100 --> 02:26.000
me the direction

02:30.050 --> 02:31.050
of the electric field.

02:31.380 --> 02:31.970
Okay.

02:32.060 --> 02:35.900
And it is pointing down right my positive is pointing up here.

02:35.900 --> 02:40.380
That's the positive direction is the way I've defined it using this coordinate system right here.

02:40.430 --> 02:40.710
All right.

02:40.940 --> 02:45.230
And again if you're just worried about kind of what the magnitude of the field is all you have to do

02:45.230 --> 02:51.700
is just take the difference of voltage divided by the separation of the plates.

02:51.710 --> 02:51.890
Right.

02:51.890 --> 02:53.300
And you'd get twelve hundred.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.020
You don't have to worry about kind of having this extra negative sine we already know the direction

02:57.020 --> 02:58.730
of the electric field just by looking at it.

02:59.750 --> 03:03.990
So what would the equate potential surfaces look like now for this.

03:04.010 --> 03:09.560
Well again right between the plates if this one is positive 30 and this one is negative 30 right between

03:09.560 --> 03:10.040
the plates.

03:10.040 --> 03:17.600
Guess what I would get I would get a zero volts as I would go kind of a quarter of the way.

03:17.780 --> 03:26.240
That's what I would get positive 15 volts and as I go kind of a quarter of the way I would get minus

03:26.240 --> 03:27.760
15 volts.

03:27.830 --> 03:30.900
These are the echoey potential surfaces.

03:30.920 --> 03:36.860
They are perpendicular to all of the field lines and that's consistent with what we said and we would

03:36.860 --> 03:43.010
get the same electric field here even if we chose kind of this to be my starting point in this to be

03:43.010 --> 03:44.700
my final point okay.

03:44.710 --> 03:50.990
It really doesn't matter because here we'd have a change of 30 volts but we'd have let's just imagine

03:50.990 --> 03:55.680
we're going to do the calculation between initial and final point here.

03:55.790 --> 04:03.920
My delta v here would be 30 volts and the spacing difference now is over 2.5 centimeters.

04:04.040 --> 04:09.300
OK guys that's 2.5 centimeters times tend to the negative 2.

04:09.330 --> 04:09.590
All right.

04:09.590 --> 04:14.720
Again if you do the calculation you should get in the negative sign if you want to carry that in the

04:14.720 --> 04:18.410
front but you're going to get negative twelve hundred volts per meter.

04:18.790 --> 04:24.410
So it really doesn't matter whether you take the full distance or just half or even just a little bit

04:25.040 --> 04:29.660
because it varies linearly here with the electrical potential.
