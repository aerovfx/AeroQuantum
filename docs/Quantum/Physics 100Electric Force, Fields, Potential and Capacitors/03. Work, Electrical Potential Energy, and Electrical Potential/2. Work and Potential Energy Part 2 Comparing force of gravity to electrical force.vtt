00:00.180 --> 00:00.420
All right.

00:00.540 --> 00:03.860
I want to do now is just compare two different cases.

00:03.870 --> 00:11.160
So the case here on the left hand side is I have a 10 kilogram box and what I want to do is pretty straightforward

00:11.190 --> 00:15.320
I just want to lifted a certain height and I want to place it on the table.

00:15.330 --> 00:20.620
So at the end we're going to have a 10 kilogram box up here.

00:20.790 --> 00:25.420
Let's look at the work being done when I raise this box over here.

00:25.470 --> 00:30.960
So first thing you can do is let's think about what the free body diagram looks like for this problem.

00:30.960 --> 00:37.680
So here's my box I just represented by a single point there is a force of gravity or a weight acting

00:37.680 --> 00:38.340
down.

00:38.340 --> 00:40.740
This here has a value M.G..

00:40.920 --> 00:43.820
All right M is 10 and Little G is nine point eight.

00:43.830 --> 00:47.280
But for this case let's just use little g for this problem.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.200
The acceleration due to gravity just to make the math simpler.

00:50.340 --> 00:52.620
Just set it equal to 10.

00:52.740 --> 00:53.040
All right.

00:53.040 --> 00:57.630
Now if there is a force lifting it this guy has to apply a force right.

00:57.630 --> 00:59.910
He has to apply a force acting up.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.120
And this is my applied force like this.

01:03.270 --> 01:03.510
All right.

01:03.510 --> 01:06.420
And if he lifts this at constant velocity.

01:06.570 --> 01:06.870
All right.

01:06.870 --> 01:11.150
That means these forces are going to balance and they're going to be equal to each other.

01:11.430 --> 01:13.350
So we can calculate what the weight is.

01:13.350 --> 01:21.090
That's pretty easy it's 10 is the mass and cagey multiplied by 10 the acceleration due to gravity.

01:21.090 --> 01:24.360
This gives me a force of 100 Newtons.

01:24.660 --> 01:33.270
That means if my applied force is one hundred Newtons I'll be able to raise this box at constant velocity.

01:33.310 --> 01:33.580
All right.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.030
Now how much energy does it take for me to lift this box.

01:38.050 --> 01:45.490
So for that case what I'm really asking for is how much work did I have to do in order to lift the box.

01:45.490 --> 01:48.000
That's how much energy it takes.

01:48.100 --> 01:48.910
So let's have a look.

01:48.910 --> 01:50.430
These forces are constant.

01:50.440 --> 01:50.650
Right.

01:50.650 --> 01:53.470
The weight is constant down here it's 100.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.400
So I can calculate how much work is done by gravity.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.990
So let's kind of look at that one first.

01:59.110 --> 02:05.740
So work done by the by the weight or by the force of gravity work done by gravity.

02:06.340 --> 02:12.590
Let's apply our equation since it's a constant force I'll call it the work done by a little g force

02:12.650 --> 02:17.910
the work done by gravity it's equal to the force the force is one hundred.

02:18.070 --> 02:25.150
All right we call that M.G. what is the displacement in this case the displacement is this is the displacement

02:25.150 --> 02:30.940
right in this case it's going to be the height one point five meters again the displacement is really

02:30.940 --> 02:34.900
a vector quantity but the magnitude is one point five.

02:35.060 --> 02:38.880
So I'm going to colleges here Delta why and what else.

02:38.880 --> 02:39.970
There is another term right.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.910
There's Kosta angle.

02:42.100 --> 02:46.750
What is the angle now between the displacement and the force.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.080
Think about it for a minute.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.110
What do we have here.

02:49.110 --> 02:56.030
We're going to have a displacement delta y which is acting up and we have our force acting down.

02:56.470 --> 03:06.610
So that means we actually have 180 degrees between the displacement and the force coast of 180 degrees.

03:06.610 --> 03:09.330
Now when if you don't know is the negative one.

03:10.450 --> 03:16.140
So at the end look what we get for an answer for the work done by gravity the work done by gravity again.

03:16.150 --> 03:21.490
This is the force that's 100 delta y is one point five.

03:21.490 --> 03:24.700
That's the magnitude and multiplied by negative 1.

03:24.700 --> 03:33.720
So we're gonna get minus one hundred and fifty joules so the reason that it's negative why is this work

03:33.760 --> 03:34.330
negative.

03:34.360 --> 03:35.980
Does that bother you at all.

03:35.980 --> 03:43.180
It's negative because the force and the displacement are in opposite directions are gonna make a little

03:43.180 --> 03:46.000
space you're going to get rid of this guy for a second.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.310
What about the work done by the supplied force.

03:48.310 --> 03:50.570
That's the other force.

03:50.650 --> 03:52.240
So in this case the work done

03:55.870 --> 04:01.420
by FAA my applied force I can calculate that one as well.

04:01.630 --> 04:02.980
So it's the work done by.

04:02.980 --> 04:03.820
Call it FAA.

04:03.820 --> 04:09.360
Down here it's the magnitude of the force which is also one hundred Newtons.

04:09.910 --> 04:15.970
It's the magnitude of the displacement which is one point five man multiplied by coast of the angle

04:15.970 --> 04:18.940
between the displacement and the applied force.

04:18.940 --> 04:20.940
In this case it's zero degrees.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.210
So I don't even have to worry about that term.

04:23.350 --> 04:33.990
So the work done by my applied force is one hundred fifty joules notice here that it is a positive number.

04:34.750 --> 04:41.890
It's positive because what we have up here in the figure where we have a force and a displacement that

04:41.890 --> 04:44.900
are along in the same direction.

04:44.960 --> 04:45.340
All right.

04:45.340 --> 04:49.630
So this here is going to be positive work being done by this force

04:51.930 --> 04:53.370
positive work.

04:55.630 --> 04:56.000
All right.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.690
So that's kind of an important example.

04:57.690 --> 05:01.560
So for me to lift this box it takes me 150 jewels of energy.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.840
That's how much work I did.

05:03.870 --> 05:07.580
All right let's take the analogous situation now for a charge.

05:07.650 --> 05:13.980
So what I have here is a plus to cool on charge just resting on a negatively charged plate.

05:14.130 --> 05:19.760
The plate is separated from another positively charged plate by five centimeters.

05:19.870 --> 05:20.280
All right.

05:20.770 --> 05:26.620
And what I want to do now is I want to move this I want to bring this charge and I want to move it up

05:26.620 --> 05:34.900
here notice it doesn't want to do that you have to apply a force on this charge in order to move it.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.860
So let's imagine we have a free body diagram lets you draw when it's halfway here.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.150
So what are we gonna have.

05:41.180 --> 05:50.290
It's placed inside an electric field so there will be an electric force acting on this charge well if

05:50.290 --> 05:52.210
it's moving to the top guess what.

05:52.210 --> 05:55.230
There better be another force acting on it in this case.

05:55.230 --> 06:01.540
This is going to be some applied for somebody has to move it all right.

06:01.570 --> 06:07.570
So we can calculate the work done by the electric force and we can also calculate the work done by the

06:07.570 --> 06:08.820
applied force.

06:08.830 --> 06:11.950
Again the difference between the two are one of them is going to be positive.

06:11.950 --> 06:18.840
The other one's going to be negative so what is the direction of the displacement for this problem.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.680
Again I start from here and I finish over here.

06:22.740 --> 06:25.630
So the displacement is delta y.

06:25.650 --> 06:30.760
That is the vector the magnitude is five centimeters.

06:30.830 --> 06:31.090
All right.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.390
So let me look at the work done by the electric field.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.530
We would say so it's gonna be the magnitude of the force.

06:38.540 --> 06:46.130
That's the charge multiplied by the field multiplied by the magnitude of the displacement which in this

06:46.130 --> 06:56.160
case is simply going to be d right the distance between the plates and multiplied by coasts of 180 degrees.

06:56.380 --> 07:01.640
So at the end we end up getting that the work done by this electric field is going to be there's gonna

07:01.660 --> 07:11.080
be a negative sign from this the charges to cool homes the electric field we said was two hundred and

07:11.080 --> 07:15.510
the distance now is five centimeters zero point zero five.

07:16.390 --> 07:18.190
All right let me put that in the calculator.

07:18.190 --> 07:27.910
So I get two times two hundred times zero point zero five at the end I get negative 20 joules that's

07:27.910 --> 07:35.470
how much work was done by the electric field the negative sign here is because the force and the displacement

07:35.470 --> 07:37.130
are in opposite directions.

07:37.280 --> 07:47.560
Force opposite of displacement.

07:47.670 --> 07:54.610
All right let's look at the work now done by my applied force the work done by the applied force in

07:54.610 --> 08:00.370
this case it's the magnitude of my applied force it's the magnitude of the displacement multiplied by

08:00.370 --> 08:09.160
cost of zero degrees so this is what we get we get our applied force again if I'm moving this at constant

08:09.850 --> 08:15.910
velocity my applied force is equal to the electric force just in a different direction so we still get

08:15.910 --> 08:24.430
QE we still get D and codes of 0 is 1 So you see at the end the work done is simply going to be plus

08:25.210 --> 08:31.360
twenty joules again negative the positive sign here is because the force and the displacement are all

08:31.600 --> 08:35.050
along the same direction very very important.
