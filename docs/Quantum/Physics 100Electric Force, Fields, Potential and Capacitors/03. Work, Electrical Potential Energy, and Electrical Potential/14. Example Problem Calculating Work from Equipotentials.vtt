Let's use what we've learned so far to consider this problem right here.

00:05.460 --> 00:12.270
So I've got a positive and a negative charge separated by some distance and they create this equity

00:12.270 --> 00:17.220
potential surfaces here are shown kind of in the plane.

00:17.250 --> 00:17.600
OK.

00:17.610 --> 00:24.180
So as I'm close to the positive charge I have positive 30 volts as I get farther away it gets smaller

00:24.180 --> 00:25.520
it's still positive.

00:25.710 --> 00:32.550
There is a equity potential surface here that is kind of zero volts and again now eyes I approach the

00:32.550 --> 00:38.430
negative charge I get kind of lower numbers or more negative numbers negative 30 volts.

00:38.430 --> 00:44.340
All right my question is simple what if I take this charge and I carry it and bring it all the way to

00:45.270 --> 00:50.400
this final position and I bring it along this very complicated path.

00:50.400 --> 00:55.400
The question is how would you calculate the work done by the electric field in this case.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.520
Kind of a hard problem right because the electric field is probably quite complicated.

00:59.910 --> 01:05.640
However if we use our concept of potential energy well we could do is easily calculate the work done

01:05.640 --> 01:09.420
by the field and also remember that the field is conservative.

01:10.020 --> 01:17.670
If it's a conservative field conservative that means that the work done by the conservative field is

01:17.760 --> 01:22.950
always equal to minus the change in electrical potential energy.

01:23.010 --> 01:25.560
So what do we have over here in my initial configuration.

01:25.560 --> 01:32.310
I have a negative five Coolum charge that is on a potential surface that's 30 volts.

01:32.460 --> 01:37.470
So that means initially what I have is a charge on a certain potential.

01:37.500 --> 01:42.400
So that is the energy of this charge when it's in this position.

01:42.450 --> 01:43.780
We can actually calculate that right.

01:43.780 --> 01:49.390
That's negative five and multiplied by 30 volts plus 30 volts.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.420
That gives me minus 1 50 Joules.

01:52.500 --> 01:58.330
That is the initial potential energy of this of the system right here.

01:58.620 --> 02:03.090
And all I want to do now is I don't really care about the path whether I take the green path or if I

02:03.090 --> 02:04.550
go in a straight line.

02:04.620 --> 02:11.860
The only thing that matter is if it's a conservative field is where it starts and where it finishes.

02:11.880 --> 02:15.370
So again the work done by the fuel we can do is just expand this.

02:15.380 --> 02:20.880
This is minus the change which is a final value minus an initial value.

02:20.880 --> 02:25.830
And if you distribute that negative side through you're just going to swap those.

02:25.830 --> 02:26.070
All right.

02:26.070 --> 02:30.150
So I need to know the initial potential energy of the system and the final.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.930
Well let's go ahead and calculate the final value over here at the end.

02:33.930 --> 02:39.270
I'm on a equate potential that is minus 20 volts.

02:39.270 --> 02:40.070
OK.

02:40.170 --> 02:47.260
So the final potential energy let's do it down here again it's Q multiplied by V final.

02:47.490 --> 02:54.100
In this case it's still negative five and negative five multiplied by the last one the final equity

02:54.100 --> 02:56.190
potential is twenty volts.

02:56.220 --> 03:02.180
So at the end I have a hundred jewels of potential energy and it's positive at the end.

03:02.310 --> 03:07.070
Again to calculate the work what we need to do is calculate this difference over here.

03:07.140 --> 03:16.060
So the initial is minus 150 and minus the final potential energy is minus one hundred positive one hundred.

03:16.080 --> 03:27.780
So at the end pretty straightforward the work done by the electric field is equal to minus 250 jewels.

03:28.380 --> 03:28.650
All right.

03:28.650 --> 03:31.490
So that would be the answer for this problem.

03:31.860 --> 03:37.470
If I wanted to know what is the work done by whoever is carrying this over here.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.890
Well that would just be the opposite sign right.

03:39.900 --> 03:47.250
The work done by the applied force is simply negative that value so would simply be 250 joules this

03:47.250 --> 03:53.670
negative charge here is quite happy to be close to the positive right here in order for me to get it

03:53.670 --> 03:54.510
over here.

03:54.510 --> 04:00.510
I really have to do put some energy into the system I have to put in 250 joules of work in order to

04:00.510 --> 04:02.180
bring it over here on the other side.
