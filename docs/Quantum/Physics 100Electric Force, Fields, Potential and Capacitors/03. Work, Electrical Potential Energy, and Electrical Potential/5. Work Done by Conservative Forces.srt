00:00.300 --> 00:04.710
All right guys I want to say a few things now about conservative forces and then we'll move on to potential

00:04.710 --> 00:10.350
energy in more detail but let me give you some examples of conservative forces that you may have already

00:10.350 --> 00:11.980
seen before.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.800
A force of gravity I mean write all these down.

00:14.820 --> 00:15.080
OK.

00:15.120 --> 00:22.920
So the force of gravity is an example of a conservative force for example the weight of an object right.

00:22.980 --> 00:24.030
M times little G.

00:24.030 --> 00:26.930
That was an example of a conservative force.

00:26.940 --> 00:31.970
Another example would be forces from springs on blocks right.

00:31.980 --> 00:33.420
We call that hooks law.

00:33.550 --> 00:33.830
Okay.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.040
So let me just call it as a spring force.

00:37.200 --> 00:45.330
This was also another example of a conservative force that forced from a spring typically written as

00:45.330 --> 00:50.560
negative K times X and X is a certain displacement from the equilibrium.

00:50.570 --> 00:56.790
All right what's really important now for this section is that we have a new conservative forces a new

00:56.790 --> 00:58.100
conservative force.

00:58.170 --> 01:05.250
So this electrical force or cool Ohm's Law god just call it an electrical force is also an example of

01:05.250 --> 01:07.430
a conservative force.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.160
Let me give you an example that's not a conservative force so non-conservative

01:14.680 --> 01:21.260
a non conservative force one example that is kind of standard is the force of friction.

01:21.340 --> 01:21.970
OK.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.330
Friction is a non conservative force.

01:24.340 --> 01:25.970
So what do we mean by this.

01:26.390 --> 01:32.560
Notice that all of these forces over here the force of gravity and the spring force.

01:33.010 --> 01:39.820
If you studied those in any detail we always had a potential energy associated to those forces.

01:40.170 --> 01:40.800
OK.

01:40.840 --> 01:47.290
For example for gravity we would talk about a gravitational potential energy and maybe you remember

01:47.290 --> 01:54.720
that one that was M.G. maybe times the height that was the potential energy associated to gravity.

01:54.720 --> 01:54.880
Right.

01:54.880 --> 02:00.850
If I lift something high it has more gravitational potential energy.

02:00.880 --> 02:06.730
How about a spring force maybe you don't remember this formula but if I stretch a spring I do work because

02:06.730 --> 02:08.030
it's hard to do that.

02:08.170 --> 02:14.320
And when I stretch the spring I store energy and that system I store energy in that spring in the form

02:14.320 --> 02:16.850
of spring potential energy.

02:16.940 --> 02:25.110
The formulas was often written as something like this one 1/2 K X square that was the spring potential

02:25.110 --> 02:26.080
energy.

02:26.130 --> 02:32.310
So what we're going to do in the next video is we're going to start now talking about what is the potential

02:32.310 --> 02:34.590
energy associated to charges.

02:34.620 --> 02:34.860
OK.

02:34.900 --> 02:39.930
So I'm going to call it again a potential energy use and I'll give you the equation after and it's going

02:39.930 --> 02:42.600
to be an electrical potential energy.

02:42.630 --> 02:42.950
All right.

02:42.990 --> 02:45.110
Maybe put a little subscript e in there.

02:45.150 --> 02:48.740
So what is the difference now between conservative versus non-conservative.

02:48.750 --> 02:49.970
Let me show you what that means.

02:49.970 --> 02:54.150
So let's go back to our parallel plate capacitor.

02:54.150 --> 02:54.350
All right.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.670
Again I'm going to make one of the charges sorry one of the plates positive and I'm going to make the

02:59.670 --> 03:02.410
other plate negative.

03:02.490 --> 03:02.720
All right.

03:02.740 --> 03:09.900
So put them charge on these plates and the previous example that we did we calculated how much work

03:09.920 --> 03:17.680
it was required to bring this positive charge from the negative plate all the way to the top.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.290
Now what why I didn't tell you about this problem was I didn't tell you how I was going to bring that

03:22.290 --> 03:28.300
charge from the initial position down here to the final position at the top.

03:28.350 --> 03:34.380
So we did the example what if I just bring it along this direct path and I had a displacement which

03:34.380 --> 03:36.030
was just like this right.

03:36.060 --> 03:38.610
This was my displacement for that problem.

03:38.610 --> 03:41.590
And I applied a force over that displacement.

03:42.090 --> 03:45.030
What if on the other hand if I took a different path.

03:45.390 --> 03:52.190
What if instead if I went like this in this direction first and I took a little break.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.460
There is the charge.

03:53.460 --> 03:55.650
And then I went on say this diagonal.

03:55.660 --> 03:56.390
Right.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.100
And I went to the same final position.

04:00.070 --> 04:07.120
If I calculated how much work was done by the electrical force for this purple path what I would do

04:07.120 --> 04:11.790
is I would find the exact same answer as I did for the blue path.

04:11.860 --> 04:12.120
All right.

04:12.130 --> 04:21.720
So the work done by the electric field in this case is the exact same as the work done right here when

04:21.720 --> 04:23.700
I go directly straight up.

04:23.730 --> 04:24.030
OK.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.990
The work is going to be the same.

04:26.070 --> 04:31.440
And that is really the definition of a conservative force is that it really doesn't matter the path

04:31.440 --> 04:32.580
that you take.

04:32.580 --> 04:37.260
It only depends on where you start and where you finish and that's it.

04:37.260 --> 04:42.770
That's the only thing you need in order to calculate the work done by that particular force.

04:42.790 --> 04:43.100
OK.

04:43.170 --> 04:50.160
So here's an example I could take this positive charge and I could bring it over this very complicated

04:50.160 --> 04:54.210
looking path and then finish at the same position.

04:54.210 --> 05:00.150
The work done in this case since the electrical force is conservative the work done would be the same

05:00.160 --> 05:04.530
because I started at the same position and I finished at the same position.

05:04.530 --> 05:09.540
So once I show you the equation to calculate the work after you'll understand why if you go to this

05:09.540 --> 05:15.340
purple section again over this segment right here there's actually no work being done.

05:15.420 --> 05:20.730
And let me show you why again the electrical force as I'm going from this position all the way to the

05:20.730 --> 05:23.970
right here the electrical force would be straight down.

05:23.970 --> 05:24.290
Right.

05:24.300 --> 05:28.740
Because it be attracted to the negative plate down here.

05:28.740 --> 05:35.230
And if you think about just this segment right here the displacement for this segment is in this direction.

05:35.280 --> 05:37.850
Let's just call this delta x.

05:38.070 --> 05:42.060
You notice that both of those vectors are perpendicular to each other.

05:42.090 --> 05:47.070
So that means that the angle theta for that first segment right here when I'm going from here to there

05:47.460 --> 05:49.330
is actually 90 degrees.

05:49.500 --> 05:54.810
And whenever you have a force and a displacement that are perpendicular to each other it means that

05:54.810 --> 06:00.920
the work over this first segment by the electrical force is actually zero.

06:00.960 --> 06:08.040
So the only component that is going to end up contributing to the work is the component of the force

06:08.040 --> 06:10.560
that is parallel to the displacement.

06:10.560 --> 06:16.800
So even if you would break down this diagonal component you can break it down into kind of small little

06:16.800 --> 06:21.240
staircases any segment here that is flat.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.460
There is no work contributions.

06:23.460 --> 06:30.320
The only the purpose only the vertical component right here is going to end up doing some work is going

06:30.340 --> 06:32.320
end up contributing to the work.

06:32.330 --> 06:32.780
All right.

06:32.940 --> 06:39.840
Let's now look at the definition of the potential energy associated to two charges.
