### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Let's have a look at các bản song song Bây giờ các bản song song we've spent quite a bit of time looking at them. Vậy let's assume that our top plate is positively charged and our bottom plate is negatively charged and these plates are separated by five centimeters. Được rồi. One thing I know is that the điện trường produced by các bản song song. Again if you're more or less in the center of the plates the điện trường is uniform it's hằng số everywhere. Đúng. And it goes from positive toward negative. Vậy this would be the điện trường that would be the hướng like this. Vậy again if I wanted to let's assume here that chúng ta có a Y axis like this. Let's take this plate here to be at zero and this played here to be at positive five centimeters. Được rồi. Vậy my definition for điện trường if I wanted to tính toán it again it would be. What is the change of hiệu điện thế relative to the change in position. OK. Vậy again it's going to be the final minus V initial divided by Trong trường hợp này it's Y final minus Y initial. Được. Vậy that's what's going to be my final and my initial really doesn't matter this could be my initial and this here could be my final. Được. Vậy my final hiệu điện thế is 30 Vôn minus the initial hiệu điện thế which is negative 30 Vôn. OK. The final position is five centimeters five times tend to the negative two and minus zero. OK. Vậy let's evaluate this determine the bracket over here it gives me positive 60 Vôn. That's the hiệu in hiệu điện thế between the top and the bottom and there's a negative there. Đúng. Vậy I should get negative 60 and divided by five times 10 to the negative two. OK. Vậy to do this math here I would do kind of five over maybe 100 something like this and 60 over five gives me twelve. Được rồi I think I did the math correctly or I should get 12 hundred and this would be Vôn per meter. Bây giờ this is really a field in the y hướng. Vậy the điện trường in the y hướng notice I get a negative sine the negative sine is simply telling me the hướng of the điện trường. Được. And it is pointing down Đúng my positive is pointing up here. That's the positive hướng is the way I've defined it using this coordinate system Đúng here. Được rồi. And again if you're just worried about kind of what the độ lớn of the field is all you have to do is just take the hiệu of hiệu điện thế divided by the separation of the plates. Đúng. And you'd get twelve hundred. You don't have to worry about kind of having this extra negative sine we already know the hướng of the điện trường just by looking at it. Vậy what would the equate thế surfaces look like Bây giờ for this. Well again Đúng between the plates if this one is positive 30 and this one is negative 30 Đúng between the plates. Guess what I would get I would get a zero Vôn as I would go kind of a quarter of the way. That's what I would get positive 15 Vôn and as I go kind of a quarter of the way I would get minus 15 Vôn. These are the echoey thế surfaces. They are perpendicular to all of the field lines and that's consistent with what we said and we would get the same điện trường here even if we chose kind of this to be my starting point in this to be my final point Được. It really doesn't matter because here we'd have a change of 30 Vôn but we'd have let's just imagine we're going to do the calculation between initial and final point here. My delta v here would be 30 Vôn and the spacing hiệu Bây giờ is ove$r^2$.5 centimeters. OK guys that's 2.5 centimeters times tend to the negative 2. Được rồi. Again if you do the calculation you should get in the negative sign if you want to carry that in the front but you're going to get negative twelve hundred Vôn per meter. Vậy it really doesn't matter whether you take the full khoảng cách or just half or even just a little bit because it varies linearly here with the electrical thế.
