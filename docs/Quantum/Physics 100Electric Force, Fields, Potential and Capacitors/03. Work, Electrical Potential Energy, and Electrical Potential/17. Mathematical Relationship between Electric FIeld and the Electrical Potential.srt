WEBVTT

00:00.190 --> 00:05.910
Right I now want to do is just look at the mathematical relationship between the electric field and

00:05.910 --> 00:07.440
the electrical potential.

00:07.620 --> 00:14.430
We saw the connection four point charges electric fuel's point out radiantly away from the point charge

00:14.760 --> 00:20.160
and the equip potential services were perpendicular to those field lines.

00:20.160 --> 00:26.000
And I also show you for the dipole the same thing happens the field is more complicated but the equip

00:26.000 --> 00:28.940
potentials were always perpendicular to those.

00:29.040 --> 00:35.560
So remember the field lines always go from high potential toward low potential.

00:35.730 --> 00:40.590
So you need the electrical potential to change for there to be an electric field.

00:40.590 --> 00:40.830
All right.

00:40.830 --> 00:45.870
So let's look at that and then we're going to apply our equation to look at parallel plates.

00:45.870 --> 00:49.680
That was the other configuration where we looked at the electric field.

00:49.830 --> 00:56.190
That case is a mathematically a little bit simpler because we said if we have parallel PLATES THE ELECTRIC

00:56.190 --> 00:57.970
FIELD IS CONSTANT.

00:58.110 --> 00:58.290
Right.

00:58.290 --> 01:01.050
It goes from the positive plate toward the negative plate.

01:01.050 --> 01:08.190
Let's see what that means in terms of the electrical potential in terms of the voltage All right.

01:08.220 --> 01:14.070
So here is the expression over here and I'm just gonna write it down as the magnitude and let's consider

01:14.070 --> 01:18.320
a place where the voltage varies linearly in space.

01:18.360 --> 01:26.030
The way you would write this here is minus the change of voltage over a change in spatial coordinate.

01:26.310 --> 01:29.160
So here's the situation I'm describing.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.200
Let's see something like this.

01:31.200 --> 01:39.620
This is my x axis and for now let's just take these are we potential surfaces and let's assume that

01:39.620 --> 01:50.360
they kind of look like this and take this here to be kind of 50 volts maybe twenty five volts 0 volts

01:50.420 --> 01:52.550
and negative twenty five volts.

01:52.600 --> 01:53.520
Okay.

01:53.620 --> 02:01.090
The spacing here could be kind of 0 meters one meter two meter three meters and so forth.

02:01.760 --> 02:08.450
If I wanted to evaluate the electric field again there's only gonna be an electric field in this direction

02:08.780 --> 02:11.860
because that is where the voltage is changing.

02:11.990 --> 02:17.030
There is no component of the electric field that has to be up and down.

02:17.030 --> 02:22.770
Right you can't have this because the voltage doesn't change along that direction right here.

02:22.820 --> 02:23.060
All right.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.350
So let me just get rid of that.

02:26.510 --> 02:26.780
All right.

02:26.810 --> 02:30.500
So we will have an electric field that goes like this.

02:30.650 --> 02:37.310
And if it varies linearly with distance again I could choose kind of this point and this point.

02:37.340 --> 02:41.890
So there are different voltages and they're separated by a certain distance.

02:41.930 --> 02:48.320
So if I wanted to find the electric field in this case again the Deltas are always a final value minus

02:48.410 --> 02:50.480
an initial value.

02:50.480 --> 02:57.580
And again this is going to be my final position minus my initial position.

02:57.690 --> 02:59.530
So let's go ahead and do that so we get minus.

02:59.530 --> 03:06.450
So the final voltage let's take this point over here so we get minus 25 and minus the initial voltage

03:06.460 --> 03:08.840
This is 50.

03:08.930 --> 03:09.450
Okay.

03:09.460 --> 03:14.620
And all of this divided by the change of space here.

03:14.620 --> 03:18.940
This is at three meters that's the final and minus zero meters like this.

03:19.830 --> 03:20.230
OK.

03:20.260 --> 03:29.590
So if you look at this term is 75 or negative 75 multiplied by that one becomes 75 over three.

03:29.590 --> 03:35.610
In this case we get 25 and this is measured in volts per meter.

03:35.650 --> 03:41.710
OK so the electric field would be 25 volts per meter OK.

03:41.770 --> 03:43.760
Notice we get a positive number.

03:43.930 --> 03:50.020
Positive number is indicative of some that point toward the positive x direction right here.

03:50.750 --> 03:51.930
OK.

03:52.090 --> 03:58.000
So that here is the electric field magnitude for that direction.

03:58.030 --> 04:03.370
All right what I said was kind of an approximation in reality really what you want to do is if you want

04:03.370 --> 04:07.870
to find the electric field this is kind of how it's represented here.

04:07.870 --> 04:09.860
Now this looks rather complicated.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.270
This here is called a gradient.

04:12.770 --> 04:21.640
And I'll define it what it is in just a second so I can write this a gradient here as a partial derivative.

04:21.790 --> 04:29.860
So it's only along one direction here of the voltage and that gives me the component of the field along

04:29.860 --> 04:32.030
the x direction.

04:32.070 --> 04:32.300
Okay.

04:32.320 --> 04:37.540
But I could have in general the voltage that varies in other directions.

04:37.540 --> 04:43.050
So actually the gradient right here actually has three components if I write it in Cartesian coordinates.

04:43.240 --> 04:50.460
If the voltage varies in the y direction again I'm going to have a y component of the electric field.

04:50.500 --> 04:58.120
This is what I would call E Y and the last term you can also have spatial variation of the voltage again

04:58.120 --> 04:59.710
along the z direction.

04:59.780 --> 05:04.420
And this is what would be called the Z component of the electric field

05:09.470 --> 05:15.500
for the case that I considered earlier this is if I'm working in Cartesian coordinates for the point

05:15.500 --> 05:23.680
charge that I considered earlier we know that the magnitude of the voltage from a certain point away

05:23.680 --> 05:30.850
the voltage I can write out as k q over are okay.

05:31.330 --> 05:37.510
The way that you would write down the electric field for this case again I would have to write out this

05:37.510 --> 05:41.340
gradient here in spherical coordinates.

05:41.380 --> 05:48.160
Again this is kind of mathematical but the only component that I'm going to get here is how does the

05:48.160 --> 05:54.250
voltage change as a function of distance away from the charge.

05:54.280 --> 05:54.570
All right.

05:54.580 --> 06:00.400
And while I'm gonna write this as k q and I'll bring the R to the top and I can do that as long as I

06:00.400 --> 06:03.320
just change the exponent to a negative.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.860
And how do you take a derivative of this function.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.480
This is pretty straightforward.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.600
You get minus one from the exponent.

06:10.600 --> 06:16.160
This is K Q and it becomes R to the minus two.

06:16.190 --> 06:21.190
Now can't forget the other negative sine I have there so that actually converts that one into a positive

06:22.790 --> 06:27.470
right and now the direction of this is always kind of pointing away in this case.

06:27.510 --> 06:31.580
Okay so that is how you would evaluate it for this point charge.

06:31.580 --> 06:36.920
So at the end the expression that I get at least for the full vector right here would be k q I'll bring

06:36.920 --> 06:43.500
the r square at the bottom and again it's pointing away from that point charge.

06:43.670 --> 06:49.520
So at any point again my electric field kind of looks like this.

06:49.870 --> 06:53.700
So this expression here is sort more like this one here.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.430
This is more for spherical.

06:57.100 --> 07:01.680
And this here is more for Cartesian coordinates.

07:01.920 --> 07:07.240
All right your class might not be going into this level of detail here but the key is that as long as

07:07.240 --> 07:11.740
you have voltage that changes in space you're going to have an electric field.
