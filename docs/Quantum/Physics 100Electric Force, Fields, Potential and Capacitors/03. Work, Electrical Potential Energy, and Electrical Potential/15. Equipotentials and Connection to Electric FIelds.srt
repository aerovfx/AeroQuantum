00:00.090 --> 00:05.680
All right I want to look at some eggy potentials here so I have this positive charge here at the center.

00:05.820 --> 00:13.710
The charge that I placed here was a one nano Coolum charge so that's 1 times 10 to the negative 9 coolant.

00:13.980 --> 00:19.950
The green lines are some of the equity potentials produced by this actually the closest the smallest

00:20.130 --> 00:21.470
circle over here.

00:21.510 --> 00:24.330
That's a 40 volt equip potential.

00:24.330 --> 00:26.660
The next biggest one is 30.

00:26.700 --> 00:34.610
This guy over here is 20 volts then 10 and the smallest the largest circle here is five volts.

00:34.610 --> 00:40.350
And again those would simply be calculated by the potential for a point charge.

00:40.350 --> 00:40.580
All right.

00:40.580 --> 00:47.580
So we can calculate the distance the arrows here represent the directions of the electric field produced

00:47.580 --> 00:48.900
by this charge.

00:48.900 --> 00:53.290
It's positive and one thing you notice is that the electric field points away from it.

00:53.310 --> 00:59.010
If I take a look at a couple of those electric field vectors over here you could see something that

00:59.010 --> 01:00.680
is starting to emerge.

01:00.720 --> 01:06.900
Hopefully you could see it right the electric field is a vector the way you would calculate the magnitude

01:06.900 --> 01:08.270
of the electric field.

01:08.280 --> 01:12.680
Again it looks similar however it's divided by R squared.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.660
And we know that the electric field gets smaller as I go away and it's stronger over here.

01:18.660 --> 01:24.840
However if you just look at the direction of the electric field pointing away look at it relative to

01:24.900 --> 01:29.520
the equity potential surfaces and you should notice something that jumps out at you.

01:29.550 --> 01:32.610
Let's focus specifically on this one right here right.

01:32.610 --> 01:39.090
This is the equity potential surface and my electric field point in this direction.

01:39.170 --> 01:40.830
Right.

01:40.920 --> 01:42.510
Notice the electric field.

01:42.530 --> 01:50.970
So let's look at some general property electric field points goes from high toward low electrical potential.

01:51.500 --> 01:52.030
OK.

01:52.590 --> 01:56.130
So electric field direction

02:01.280 --> 02:08.570
goes from high goes from high potential

02:11.450 --> 02:12.770
toward low potential

02:17.940 --> 02:20.590
that's very very important.

02:20.590 --> 02:29.040
The other property is has to do with the direction of the field relative to the equity potential services.

02:29.050 --> 02:29.350
Right.

02:29.350 --> 02:34.510
The one thing we also notice from this diagram that you should notice is that the electric field direction

02:38.370 --> 02:50.510
is what is perpendicular to the equity potentials.

02:50.560 --> 02:50.950
All right.

02:50.980 --> 02:55.900
I can't emphasize how important this is so we're gonna be able to kind of if you're giving electric

02:55.900 --> 03:00.560
field direction we should be able to draw with the equity potentials look like.

03:00.820 --> 03:05.710
In addition if you're given a diagram with equity potentials you should be able they at least have an

03:05.710 --> 03:09.660
idea of what direction the electric field goes in.

03:09.670 --> 03:17.470
You notice that the electric field is pointing perpendicular to all of these equity potential surfaces.

03:17.590 --> 03:23.560
And notice that there is no component of an electric field that has anything parallel to the equity

03:23.560 --> 03:24.950
potential.

03:25.180 --> 03:26.560
It's always perpendicular.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.580
We never have a case like this always perpendicular.

03:30.610 --> 03:30.890
OK.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.500
So this is super super important.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.670
I mean let me highlight this second point here.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.710
This one's even more important than the first.
