And Bây giờ I want to again illustrate this with another example how he can use bảo toàn năng lượng in order to solve problems. Vậy here's the problem I have I have again my two micro cooling điện tích. I'm going to assume that that điện tích is fixed in space and 30 meters away I'm going to place a negative three micro cooling điện tích. Vậy those are attracted to each other. I'm going to release the negative three micro cooling điện tích Vậy it's going to have a lực acting toward the positive one. And it's going to start to tốc độ up. Vậy the question is when it's five meters away Bây giờ how fast is the điện tích moving. Được rồi Vậy I've got it illustrated above. Vậy this is the tốc độ that I'm looking for. Vậy let's go see how chúng ta có thể use bảo toàn năng lượng. Look at the total energy at one position the initial and set that equal to the total energy of the final position and then solve for the unknown. The nice thing about using bảo toàn năng lượng is you typically only have one phương trình to solve for. OK. That's the bảo toàn năng lượng Vậy if you're able to write down that statement you look at what the unknown is and that's typically what you have to solve for let me show you how you use bảo toàn năng lượng Bây giờ to solve this problem. Vậy again the total energy at the initial position is the kinetic plus the initial thế and that has to be equal to the final kinetic plus the final thế. Bây giờ chúng ta có thể substitute here again if I'm releasing the particle here the điện tích from arrest. They don't have to worry about the initial động năng. I will have some initial electrical thế energy and I will have some final Đúng because I'm not at an infinite khoảng cách away anywhere. Vậy I do have to keep all these other terms I'm looking for the tốc độ and the tốc độ is going to be tucked inside this final động năng. Let's start writing down our expressions. Vậy that's what chúng ta có. K. Q1 Q2 divided by our 1 are our initial rather. That's my initial thế energy at equals 2 1 1/2 m v final bình phương. That's our final động năng and plus K. Q1 Q2 divided by our final by our final Trong trường hợp này is five meters. Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có to do a little bit of algebra in order to get an expression for the tốc độ you could substitute the numbers here and get numbers for all this and that's fine there's nothing wrong with that. I'm going to just do it algebraic Lee for Bây giờ and at the end I'll get one number. OK. Vậy I'm going to bring this final thế energy on the other side. OK. And I'll bring the động năng. Let me just write it like this. Được rồi. Vậy my động năng my final động năng then becomes somebody whose terms are the same Vậy I can actually factor them out. That's pretty easy. And here I'm going to get one divided by our initial minus one divided by our final. OK. Vậy that's not too bad. And Bây giờ some of the math. Bây giờ if I want to just get one final expression I'm going to get V final there's going to be a square root and it's gonna be kind of a lengthy term. Được rồi it's going to be two K Q1 Q2 divided by the mass and again I have this term here of 1 divided by our initial minus 1 divided by our final. OK. Vậy we could start substituting the numbers in here Bây giờ and everything is going to work out. Again chúng ta có to put in all the signs. OK. Vậy chúng ta có to chúng ta có nine times tend to the nine. That's the K value. The first điện tích is to micro cool on positive to tend to the negative six. The second one was negative. Don't worry the negative side is not going to appear under the square root at the end you'll see that the term in the bracket here is also going to be negative. Vậy this các điện tích negative three micro columns. I'm going to divide by the mass of the mass I said was 2.5 times 10 to the negative three for this problem. OK. And Bây giờ I still have this remaining term. Vậy 1 divided by the initial which is 30. That's gonna be a small number minus one over five Được. Vậy after evaluating then the calculator you should get a number that looks like did things correctly I think I got a number that was approximately two point seven meters per second. Được. Vậy that's kind of how you would do a problem like this using bảo toàn năng lượng. Được rồi really really powerful technique especially when they're asking you for quantities that are scalar is like calculating the tốc độ.
