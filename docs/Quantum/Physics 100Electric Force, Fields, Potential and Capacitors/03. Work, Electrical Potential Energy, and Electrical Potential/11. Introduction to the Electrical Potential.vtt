Another important topic now is something called electrical potential.

00:04.180 --> 00:05.890
Notice it's missing the word energy.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.160
There's not what we just saw it's similar.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.240
And it'll be related to it but it's a little bit different.

00:11.250 --> 00:11.470
All right.

00:11.490 --> 00:14.340
But before we do that let's first look at what we had.

00:14.370 --> 00:17.290
So we had electrical force right.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.680
Force was a vector.

00:20.190 --> 00:29.760
If we had point charges for example we could write down that the force was K Q1 Q2 over our squared.

00:29.760 --> 00:37.640
Let me just write point charges just to remind ourselves here.

00:37.660 --> 00:37.870
All right.

00:37.870 --> 00:44.980
The other thing we had were that electric charge produce a field around them and that was something

00:44.980 --> 00:48.040
we had called an electric field we called it e..

00:48.330 --> 00:49.410
OK.

00:49.460 --> 00:54.700
And again let me just write it down k q 1 for example divided by our squared.

00:54.700 --> 00:57.400
And this was also four point charges.

00:57.420 --> 01:01.710
We just put an arrow up here those quantities.

01:01.710 --> 01:08.880
Now if I place they another charge inside that electric field produced by Q1 I could have a force acting

01:08.880 --> 01:09.990
between them.

01:10.040 --> 01:10.310
All right.

01:10.340 --> 01:17.700
So we could actually also write the force as being the charge Q2 that I place inside that electric field

01:18.540 --> 01:19.130
e.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.170
Okay.

01:20.190 --> 01:25.680
And actually this is true whether we're talking about point charges or whether I'm talking about a point

01:25.680 --> 01:29.390
charge inside the field produced by a parallel plate capacitor.

01:29.430 --> 01:29.610
Right.

01:29.610 --> 01:32.340
This equation down here is actually quite general.

01:32.340 --> 01:34.240
So let me kind of highlight this one.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.320
It's kind of the general case.

01:37.320 --> 01:41.670
Now all of these quantities here are vector quantities.

01:41.850 --> 01:45.690
So they have a magnitude and a direction associated with it.

01:47.070 --> 01:51.680
Well we just focused on now was having electrical potential energy.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.560
And the formula we had for the electrical potential energy.

01:55.650 --> 02:05.130
It looked similar to the magnitude of the force except it was only divided by R instead of our squared.

02:05.160 --> 02:05.660
All right.

02:05.700 --> 02:12.540
So in order for there to be a force you need at least two charges in order for there to be electrical

02:12.540 --> 02:16.420
potential energy you need at least two charges.

02:16.460 --> 02:17.000
All right.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.480
Further to be an electric field there only needs to be one charge that produces the electric field around

02:23.480 --> 02:24.640
it.

02:24.650 --> 02:29.210
Well we're going to say now is we're going to introduce this new concept called electrical potential

02:29.570 --> 02:32.510
and we're gonna use the letter V to describe it.

02:32.510 --> 02:37.380
So it's kind of like the same principle like what happens if we only have one charge.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.270
There's not electrical potential energy because there's only one charge.

02:41.440 --> 02:47.160
But what we're gonna say is that this charge is going to produce a field around it.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.470
In this case here this is.

02:49.490 --> 02:56.000
Let me just define you here this is what we call the potential and this is going to be an example of

02:56.000 --> 03:01.100
a scalar field.

03:01.220 --> 03:05.410
It's not like electric field electric field is a vector field.

03:05.450 --> 03:12.110
It has a magnitude any direction at every point in space for the electrical potential.

03:12.110 --> 03:18.370
What we're going to have is only a number the number could be positive or negative it could be zero.

03:18.460 --> 03:26.650
We're going to find that and we're going to look at the cases for point charges for parallel plates.

03:26.740 --> 03:27.220
OK.

03:27.260 --> 03:33.430
And we're going to see how it's can actually be used to calculate the electric field.

03:33.770 --> 03:39.500
So let's go ahead and start with point charges that's the easiest case and then we'll add to this picture

03:39.500 --> 03:43.250
right here of the connection now between these four things.
