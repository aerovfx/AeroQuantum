### Tóm tắt nội dung

Vậy here's the first question here chúng ta có as a proton moves in the hướng of điện trường lines. Then chúng ta có some choices is moving from low to high thế gaining thế energy. Then chúng ta có all of kind of the different variations. Được rồi. Vậy I think what I would suggest over here is you just kind of draw what's going on Vậy let's draw an điện trường. Được rồi. Let's take the simplest case over here. Đúng. Here's an điện trường and draw a proton Đúng. Here's a proton Vậy there would be a lực tác dụng lên the proton which would be QE. Được rồi. Vậy that's from the lực perspective. But what about the thế. Bây giờ if I have field lines that point from the left to the Đúng it means that this side over here imagine what would tạo ra an điện trường like this. Đúng. We might have a positive plate. And if the điện trường lines finish over here that would mean that this side here would be negative. Đúng. Because that would give me a lực that would be the reason why the proton would move toward the Đúng. Đúng move toward the negative plate. Vậy if this is positive Đúng. We say that this here is at a high hiệu điện thế. This is high. ví dụ let's just set it to 30 Vôn imagine this one here this one here might be negative 30 Vôn that would be the thế. Được rồi. Vậy let's go see what is. It's moving from a low thế to high thế. Không it's moving from high thế toward low thế. It can't be that can't be in Choice C Đúng Choice C says oh sorry to a C could still be Đúng or it can't be choice B B says it's moving from low to high. OK. Vậy chúng ta có thể't do that. Vậy it has to be from high thế toward low thế. The second part deals with the energy. OK. Vậy what happens to the energy as it moves both its thế remain hằng số. It's not going to remain hằng số Vậy let's get rid of choice e because it's moving like this. Được rồi. Vậy what happens to the thế energy if you remember thế energy. We read it as queue times V for Bây giờ let's just assume that the proton điện tích as we know it's positive. But let's just set it to one cooling. Vậy what would that mean for the thế energy over here the thế energy on this side would be well que times V Vậy it'd be one times 30 and this would be positive. Đúng. Positive 30 joules and then what happens while over here it would be you final would be Q would be one. The thế is negative 30. Đúng. Vậy it'd be negative 30 joules Vậy it has to lose electrical thế energy because what's happening it's going faster down over here. Đúng. It's gaining động năng over here. If something gains động năng it has to come from somewhere. OK Vậy it has to be losing electrical thế energy. Vậy really D has to be the Đúng case over here. It can't be gaining electrical thế energy. Được rồi. Vậy that's it for the first problem. Hopefully you understand that one. Được rồi. Vậy there's the next problem. If the electrical thế is zero at some place in space then they talk about the điện trường at that point must be negative zero uniform positive impossible to determine. Được rồi. Vậy first chúng ta có to figure out well what happens when the thế is zero. What I would suggest Trong trường hợp này is we try to figure out the simplest possible case where the thế is zero. I'm going to use point các điện tích. Đúng. And we know that Đúng over here at this Đúng at the midpoint if these các điện tích are the same. Vậy if this is kind of plus q and this guy's negative Q that V at the center should be equal to zero because they would cancel out. Đúng. You would have k q over R and then you would have K and negative q over our member having the sign of the điện tích is important when you tính toán the electrical thế. Vậy we would get zero Vôn Đúng here at the center. What else do we know. What is the electrical field at that point. Well the electrical field we know is points away from positive toward negative Đúng. The điện trường is in this hướng over here. Vậy chúng ta có thể't really say if it's negative Đúng. Negative just tells us the hướng is definitely not zero. It's not necessarily going to be uniform. The điện trường I mean it's just that one point I'm positive again you can't really say I would say he is probably the best answer for this problem Đúng here based on what's given. The only thing I could say is that there is an điện trường at that point even though the hiệu điện thế is zero. OK. Kind of a little bit of a tricky question. Here's problem three chúng ta có four các điện tích here. Two of them are positive to a negative and they're in this kind of three dimensions over here. They have the same độ lớn. They just have different signs. Được rồi. OK. Let me kind of highlight which ones are negative over here make those in red. They pop out a bit more. Được rồi they're all the same khoảng cách from the origin which is over here. What is the electrical thế at point p due to these các điện tích. OK. Vậy if we think about is it going to be zero positive negative or impossible to determine. Well if they're all arranged like this one thing we should know is they're all kind of the same khoảng cách Đúng. They're all the same khoảng cách because the khoảng cách from the origin is the same. They're all a certain khoảng cách. Let's call it D from the origin which means that this khoảng cách R is also all the same for both of them. Vậy if you would be calculating the total electrical thế what you would do is I mean for the first one over here what you would do is you would have k q over R you'd have another term like this for the second điện tích which we k q over R and then you would have two terms with negative các điện tích. I would put negative Q here and then over R and then I'd have another term Đúng. Plus K negative q over R. Vậy at the end when I would add all of those things I'd have two positive ones and two negatives I would have zero Vôn. Vậy we'd have zero electrical thế. Vậy again the best choice for this one here is probably a choice a Được rồi. Let's Bây giờ look at this problem over here what chúng ta có is an electron and a proton they're release from rest and there's only electrostatic các lực acting between them which are the following statements must be true. And they said there could be more than one điện tích. Được rồi. Vậy they talk about the energy thế energy either increasing or decreasing the động năng and the gia tốc keeps decreasing. Được rồi. Vậy let's have a look at it first of all. Vậy let's just draw it out. Imagine chúng ta có a proton and an electron it doesn't matter what we put for the các điện tích. Vậy what we could do is here let's just call this 1 1 cool dome and negative 1. Cool. It doesn't matter whether chúng ta có the Đúng điện tích. We just want to look at what's going to happen. The key is that one is positive. The other one is negative. Được rồi. Vậy what happens to the thế energy. Well as they get closer remember there's a lực tác dụng lên and they are attracted to each other. Vậy they're going to move closer together. Vậy at some point they're going to look like this. Vậy they're going to get closer. Đúng the khoảng cách are here is going to get smaller. Here it was kind of big. Đúng. Được rồi. Vậy they get closer let's call this are 1 and are 2. Vậy the thế energy in the first case over here if you think about it how do we write it down. It's K Q1 Q2 and this one here would be a positive one negative one and divided by our one. Here I would get negative K over R1 I could get a number for that ví dụ but notice that it is negative and that's important Đúng. Vậy I start off with some negative value. That's my initial thế energy. What about my final thế energy final thế energy is again k 1 minus one what happens to our two imagine our one is put a number in there what if this is ten Đúng ten meters apart let's get rid of this one if I write this as ten and Trong trường hợp này here what if I write this as one meter. Đúng. Vậy they're getting close together won't be just one. Vậy at the end here you get minus K over 1. Vậy you notice that this is. Được rồi. This guy here is is more negative. Được rồi. This guy here is more negative Vậy we notice that it is smaller. If something is more negative it is smaller. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the thế energy is actually getting more negative which means it's decreasing. Được rồi. Vậy it's not increasing it's decreasing Đúng here. It's kind of a little tricky. Bây giờ if there's a lực tác dụng lên it all what happens. They start to accelerate. Đúng. That's given by cool ohms Laura for. Vậy it'd be k Q1 Q2 divided by our 1 bình phương. What would it be down over here. It would be k Q1 Q2 divided by R2 bình phương. Notice that the khoảng cách is smaller over here. Vậy the lực would be bigger. Whatever lực you have here this lực is bigger this lực here is smaller. Vậy a smaller lực because the khoảng cách changes bigger lực. Được rồi. Vậy the gia tốc doesn't decrease. Đúng. If the lực is getting bigger it means the gia tốc is increasing. Vậy can't be that one. Được rồi what about the energy concept. What do you think happens to the động năng. Does it increase or decrease. Well again it should increase if things are moving faster. The động năng should increase and it definitely doesn't decrease. OK. Vậy that's kind of how I would argue all of this one for a problem for Đúng here's problem five. chúng ta có a region of space that has a uniform điện trường that is hằng số. It points from the left to the Đúng as shown in the figure. Which statement is correct. Được rồi. The thế out of all these three points is the same or the thế at a and b are the same and c is at high higher thế a B or the same thế that C is lower or a B A is higher than B and Vậy forth. Choice D Đúng here. Vậy one thing they tell us is that the field is uniform. Well let's think about what would tạo ra a uniform điện trường Đúng here. What would what would this side look like versus this side. Again this looks like a parallel plate tụ điện to me. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that this side here would be positive and this side here would be negatively charged that would tạo ra an điện trường that goes like this. Vậy ví dụ this side here might be at 10 Vôn and this side here might be at negative 10 Vôn. The center in that case would be zero Vôn. We know that the điện trường tells us how the hiệu điện thế changes with respect to the position. Bây giờ if this is hằng số điều đó có nghĩa là that the hiệu điện thế varies with the khoảng cách has a hằng số slope. điều đó có nghĩa là I go from plus 10 to negative 10. In kind of a straight line Được rồi. If you were going to actually make a plot of hiệu điện thế versus position Well I would start over here at 10 Vôn and I would end up at negative 10 Vôn once I reach the other plate. Imagine the other plate finishes here Vậy this would be a graph like this. The slope of that line would give us the điện trường Đúng here and you'd also be at 0 Vôn Đúng at the center. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that remember we also talked about the equal thế. If điện trường lines are going like this it means that the equal thế lines have to look like this. This might be 9 Vôn. The center here you might get 5 Vôn Đúng 0 Vôn at the center. Negative 5 Vôn write down some values here as I get closer I am approaching negative 10. Vậy again these are equal thế lines we call those equal potentials Được. Vậy kind of different ways of looking at it. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that a and b would be at the same thế and C would be at a lower electrical thế. Vậy definitely not the same everywhere. Được a and b are equal. That's fine. The thế at point C is higher. Không we just said it has to be lower because the điện trường is pointing that way. thế C is lower this one here makes sense to me. Let's look at choice D the thế thế at Point A is highest low A and B have to be at the same thế. Vậy kind of a little bit of a tricky question also but again using the concept of equal thế lines they have to be perpendicular to the điện trường perpendicular to E field. Được rồi that's it for the quiz guys hopefully you understood some of this.
