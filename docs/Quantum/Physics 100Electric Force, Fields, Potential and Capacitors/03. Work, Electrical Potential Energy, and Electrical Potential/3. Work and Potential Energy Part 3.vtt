00:00.150 --> 00:06.870
We just looked at two examples of the work done and the work done by constant forces I can't emphasize

00:06.870 --> 00:11.040
this enough guy so constant forces were gravity.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.530
This applied force.

00:12.540 --> 00:18.870
Maybe the work done by the electric field or by the electric force between parallel plates.

00:18.900 --> 00:25.510
Now if you think about it now when you do work like in this case my applied force did 150 miles of work.

00:25.590 --> 00:34.140
What we say now is that when there is energy put into the system we say that at the end we have stored

00:35.550 --> 00:40.740
some potential energy in the system so stored some potential

00:43.320 --> 00:46.100
energy.

00:46.260 --> 00:53.630
We now say that this 10 kg of 10 kg mass has gravitational potential energy.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.180
That's what we say right here right.

00:55.200 --> 01:04.710
We say there is rather Asian traditional potential energy and you have potential energy when something

01:04.710 --> 01:05.340
did work.

01:05.340 --> 01:07.930
We did 150 miles of work.

01:08.080 --> 01:15.210
OK so the amount of potential energy that we have our final potential energy that we had usually typically

01:15.210 --> 01:23.510
use the letter you for this guy was equal to again the force was M.G. and the height was H.

01:23.580 --> 01:23.960
OK.

01:23.990 --> 01:28.770
But this was really the work that was done by this force to lift the block.

01:28.770 --> 01:33.390
Now you may have seen this equation before for gravitational potential energy

01:36.280 --> 01:37.630
the energy of mass.

01:37.630 --> 01:41.240
That is a certain height above the ground for example.

01:41.730 --> 01:46.150
And that's how much work was done in order to lift this mass.

01:46.150 --> 01:53.440
So now if I go back to the electric field example well the same concept applies.

01:53.440 --> 02:00.310
I would say that we did how many jewels of work we ended up doing 20 jewels of work in order to move

02:00.310 --> 02:03.460
a to cool ohm charge all the way to the top.

02:05.140 --> 02:11.980
Well in other words once it's at the top right here in this top position I would say we have stored

02:12.400 --> 02:18.820
some potential energy except in this case we're going to call it electrical potential energy

02:24.710 --> 02:25.670
write this down.

02:25.730 --> 02:29.210
It's very very important because work was done

02:34.080 --> 02:36.560
work was done on the charge on the system.

02:36.660 --> 02:42.070
So therefore now I'm storing some electrical potential energy into the system.

02:42.450 --> 02:48.200
In this case the amount of potential energy that I've stored into the system again it was the force

02:48.210 --> 02:54.530
this was the charge multiplied by the field and multiplied by the distance D.

02:54.730 --> 03:01.020
And notice I had a positive number over here for my final potential energy and that was equal to 20

03:01.020 --> 03:05.030
joules that's how much potential energy I have in the system right now.
