# Example Calculating the Potential Energy between Point Charges

## 03. Work, Electrical Potential Energy, and Electrical Potential

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Have a look at two kind of silly examples over here we only have two point chargers in the top figure and we want to use my phương trình to tính toán Bây giờ the total electrical thế energy in the system. Vậy I have two micro columns and a four micro column point charger separated by three meters. Vậy again the công thức is exactly the same. Vậy chúng ta có nine times 10 to the 9 that's the K value same as before. And Bây giờ I'm going to have two times ten to the negative six. I'm going to have four times 10 to the negative six. And at the end here I have to divide by the khoảng cách and it's only three. Vậy you've got gotta be a little bit careful and that's it. Bây giờ we put the number in the calculator and we get zero point zero to four. Bây giờ that is measured in Joules pretty straightforward. How about the second case. Vậy this case a little bit different to micro column a negative 5 micro column and separated by 5 meters Trong trường hợp này. What is the electrical thế energy in the system. Vậy I would go nine times 10 to the nine what else. Two times ten to the negative six. Ha. Bây giờ the key here. Notice I have the negative side. Negative five times 10 to the negative six and divided by five Trong trường hợp này. Được rồi put that number in the calculator and lo and behold I'm gonna get a negative number and zero point zero one eight. Jules this is OK. This can be negative. OK. Vậy don't let that scare you. Đúng what if I did a third case and let's just keep it rather simple instead of having a positive to micro cool on. Let's have a negative Trong trường hợp này and another negative. We'll keep this one the same minus five micro cool on and let's convert this one to negative to micro cool on and we'll keep the same spacing. Let's see what happens Trong trường hợp này. Again the công thức is the same again it's going to look the exact same except 10 to the 9. OK. Bây giờ I've switched the sine here Vậy it's important for me to have that sign here because I'm calculating a scalar quantity. And actually the sign is important. Times 10 to the negative 6. Vậy both of those are negative các điện tích and multiply. Sorry divided by five meters again. Vậy what are we going to get Trong trường hợp này again these two negative signs are going to cancel out and we're going to be left with a positive zero point zero one eight jewels. Vậy notice when I have two positive các điện tích I'm going to have positive thế energy when I have two negatives. I'm also going to have positive thế energy. And when I have các điện tích that are of different sign like in the second case Đúng here I'm going to end up having negative electrical thế energy. And that's OK. Bây giờ the other thing to notice is that when r gets very very big when it tends toward infinity the electrical thế energy tends toward zero. OK. Vậy that's kind of the other important thing. Được rồi. If you understand this we're off to the races.
