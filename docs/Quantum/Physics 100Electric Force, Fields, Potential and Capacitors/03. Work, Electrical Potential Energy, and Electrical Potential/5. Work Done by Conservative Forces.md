# Work Done by Conservative Forces

## 03. Work, Electrical Potential Energy, and Electrical Potential

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi guys I want to say a few things Bây giờ about conservative các lực and then we'll move on to thế energy in more detail but let me give you some examples of conservative các lực that you may have already seen before. A lực of gravity I mean write all these down. OK. Vậy the lực of gravity is an example of a conservative lực ví dụ the weight of an object Đúng. M times little G. That was an example of a conservative lực. Another example would be các lực from springs on blocks Đúng. We call that hooks law. Được. Vậy let me just call it as a spring lực. This was also another example of a conservative lực that forced from a spring typically written as negative K times X and X is a certain độ dời from the equilibrium. Được rồi what's really important Bây giờ for this section is that chúng ta có a new conservative các lực a new conservative lực. Vậy this electrical lực or cool Ohm's Law god just call it an electrical lực is also an example of a conservative lực. Let me give you an example that's not a conservative lực Vậy non-conservative a non conservative lực one example that is kind of standard is the lực of friction. OK. Friction is a non conservative lực. Vậy what do we mean by this. Notice that all of these các lực over here the lực of gravity and the spring lực. If you studied those in any detail we always had a thế energy associated to those các lực. OK. ví dụ for gravity we would talk about a gravitational thế energy and maybe you remember that one that was M.G. maybe times the height that was the thế energy associated to gravity. Đúng. If I lift something high it has more gravitational thế energy. How about a spring lực maybe you don't remember this công thức but if I stretch a spring I do work because it's hard to do that. And when I stretch the spring I store energy and that system I store energy in that spring in the form of spring thế energy. The formulas was often written as something like this one 1/2 K X square that was the spring thế energy. Vậy what we're going to do in the next video is we're going to start Bây giờ talking about what is the thế energy associated to các điện tích. OK. Vậy I'm going to call it again a thế energy use and I'll give you the phương trình after and it's going to be an electrical thế energy. Được rồi. Maybe put a little subscript e in there. Vậy what is the hiệu Bây giờ between conservative versus non-conservative. Let me show you what điều đó có nghĩa là. Vậy let's go back to our parallel plate tụ điện. Được rồi. Again I'm going to make one of the các điện tích sorry one of the plates positive and I'm going to make the other plate negative. Được rồi. Vậy put them điện tích on these plates and the previous example that we did we calculated how much work it was required to bring this positive điện tích from the negative plate all the way to the top. Bây giờ what why I didn't tell you about this problem was I didn't tell you how I was going to bring that điện tích from the initial position down here to the final position at the top. Vậy we did the example what if I just bring it along this direct path and I had a độ dời which was just like this Đúng. This was my độ dời for that problem. And I applied a lực over that độ dời. What if on the other hand if I took a different path. What if instead if I went like this in this hướng first and I took a little break. There is the điện tích. And then I went on say this diagonal. Đúng. And I went to the same final position. If I calculated how much work was done by the electrical lực for this purple path what I would do is I would find the exact same answer as I did for the blue path. Được rồi. Vậy the work done by the điện trường Trong trường hợp này is the exact same as the work done Đúng here when I go directly straight up. OK. The work is going to be the same. And that is really the definition of a conservative lực is that it really doesn't matter the path that you take. It only depends on where you start and where you finish and that's it. That's the only thing you need in order to tính toán the work done by that particular lực. OK. Vậy here's an example I could take this positive điện tích and I could bring it over this very complicated looking path and then finish at the same position. The work done Trong trường hợp này since the electrical lực is conservative the work done would be the same because I started at the same position and I finished at the same position. Vậy once I show you the phương trình to tính toán the work after you'll understand why if you go to this purple section again over this segment Đúng here there's actually Không work being done. And let me show you why again the electrical lực as I'm going from this position all the way to the Đúng here the electrical lực would be straight down. Đúng. Because it be attracted to the negative plate down here. And if you think about just this segment Đúng here the độ dời for this segment is in this hướng. Let's just call this delta x. You notice that both of those vectors are perpendicular to each other. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the angle theta for that first segment Đúng here when I'm going from here to there is actually 90 degrees. And whenever you have a lực and a độ dời that are perpendicular to each other it means that the work over this first segment by the electrical lực is actually zero. Vậy the only component that is going to end up contributing to the work is the component of the lực that is parallel to the độ dời. Vậy even if you would break down this diagonal component you can break it down into kind of small little staircases any segment here that is flat. There is Không work contributions. The only the purpose only the vertical component Đúng here is going to end up doing some work is going end up contributing to the work. Được rồi. Let's Bây giờ look at the definition of the thế energy associated to two các điện tích.
