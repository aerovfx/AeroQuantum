00:00.120 --> 00:03.810
Okay so we're gonna start off with one of the simple cases here we're going to look at the electrical

00:03.810 --> 00:05.170
potential energy.

00:05.220 --> 00:10.350
However I am going to limit my discussion here to point charges.

00:10.850 --> 00:11.340
OK.

00:11.340 --> 00:17.220
So what are we knowable point charges we know that we've already seen that there is a force acting on

00:17.220 --> 00:24.720
between them and the forces given by cool Ohm's Law and I can write it as this K Q1 Q2 and over the

00:24.720 --> 00:28.260
distance squared just right as R squared.

00:28.260 --> 00:35.220
So let me go out somewhere in space and imagine here this is just empty space and I place one positive

00:35.220 --> 00:42.870
charge here and I stick it there I glue it so it can't move so it is actually fixed in space.

00:43.110 --> 00:43.400
All right.

00:43.410 --> 00:44.270
Now what do I do.

00:44.310 --> 00:50.130
I'm gonna go really really far away and I'm gonna go and find a another charge and for this case let's

00:50.130 --> 00:52.750
just consider a another positive charge.

00:52.830 --> 00:56.600
So here I am out in space I'm gonna grab that positive charge.

00:56.670 --> 00:57.000
All right.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.600
Now what happens when I bring it closer.

01:00.600 --> 01:06.450
Well when it's in this position right here guess what there is a little bit of a force acting on this

01:06.450 --> 01:06.960
charge.

01:06.960 --> 01:13.600
There's also a little force acting on this one but I have something that is keeping it fixed.

01:13.710 --> 01:14.670
So what happens now.

01:14.670 --> 01:17.280
Well I'm going to apply a force right here.

01:17.280 --> 01:24.240
This is my applied force FAA and what I want to do now is I want to bring this charge and I want to

01:24.240 --> 01:26.130
place it right over here.

01:26.130 --> 01:29.890
But what happens as I start bringing it closer.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.670
Right as I start bringing it closer it's harder for me to do that right.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.880
Because imagine when I'm kind of getting close to my final position all right.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.360
This here is the final position let me write that down so this is final position

01:46.290 --> 01:50.730
so if you think about it now if you draw what the force is well since it's much closer together the

01:50.730 --> 01:55.440
force is going to be bigger and again the force I can calculate from cool Ohm's Law.

01:55.730 --> 01:59.350
So I'm got make this vector down over here bigger.

01:59.360 --> 01:59.990
All right.

02:00.450 --> 02:06.050
Well I had to apply a force in order to bring that one there it's not going to get there by itself.

02:06.050 --> 02:06.300
Right.

02:06.300 --> 02:12.830
So my applied force for only to hold it here has to be at least as big as cool Ohm's Law.

02:13.020 --> 02:22.660
So I had to do some positive work in order to bring this charge all the way to this final position.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.830
So let me call this final spacing here.

02:24.830 --> 02:26.070
Let's call it a distance.

02:26.130 --> 02:30.100
Ah so we'd be able to use this equation to calculate the force.

02:30.360 --> 02:37.770
First of all during this path remember that F.A. my applied force does positive work

02:40.800 --> 02:46.650
the work done by the electric field in this case would be negative because the force the electric force

02:47.040 --> 02:50.320
is like this and my displacement is like this.

02:50.370 --> 02:56.280
So the angle is 180 degrees in that case which gives me negative work.

02:56.280 --> 03:02.100
Now I can't use my equation unfortunately in order to calculate the work done by the electric force

03:02.100 --> 03:03.520
that I did previously.

03:03.540 --> 03:07.230
You can't just use f DOT and the displacement.

03:07.410 --> 03:15.090
And the reason you can't this the reason you can't use this is because the force is not constant so

03:15.090 --> 03:20.060
it doesn't apply for this particular case but I'll show you how to do it in this case.

03:20.370 --> 03:22.580
But just remember this you've got to be a little bit careful.

03:22.590 --> 03:27.810
I can still kind of use the argument to decide whether or not the work is positive or negative I just

03:28.230 --> 03:31.690
I'm unable to use this equation to calculate the work.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.870
All right regardless this charge eventually made it to this position.

03:36.300 --> 03:41.400
So there is a force acting on it and there was some work done by this applied force.

03:41.400 --> 03:47.490
Whenever you do some work you're going to end up storing some potential energy in the system.

03:47.490 --> 03:47.760
OK.

03:47.790 --> 03:56.070
So the electrical potential energy this is a definition now you write it all down.

03:56.970 --> 04:00.750
Now it's energy which is going to be measured in jewels.

04:00.750 --> 04:01.140
All right.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.570
So that's gonna be my unit at the end of the equation again.

04:05.580 --> 04:11.900
I'm gonna write it as you and I'm going to put a subscript e to remind me that it is electrical.

04:12.090 --> 04:12.360
All right.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.110
The formula looks pretty similar to cool Ohm's Law.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.330
So we have the same constant k.

04:18.510 --> 04:25.860
I still have the charges Q1 and Q2 except now it gets divided only by the distance.

04:25.880 --> 04:35.270
Ah so this is the equation pretty straightforward now there are some differences.

04:35.270 --> 04:38.430
Energy is a scalar quantity.

04:38.450 --> 04:41.660
OK so it's just a number.

04:41.660 --> 04:48.460
This here was a vector quantity so which had a magnitude and a direction associated with it.

04:48.530 --> 04:54.130
Now one kind of comment about this one I was calculating forces using my cool Ohm's law up here.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.930
I really didn't care whether was positive or negative.

04:57.020 --> 04:57.340
OK.

04:57.350 --> 05:03.860
Because positive and negative when I put the charges in here they only tell me something about the direction

05:03.860 --> 05:08.410
of the force for potential energy.

05:08.510 --> 05:14.870
It's going to be very very important to actually put the signs of the charges in here.

05:14.870 --> 05:20.540
So in this case if this is positive and this is positive and they're separated by some distance I am

05:20.540 --> 05:24.950
going to get a positive potential energy in the system.

05:24.950 --> 05:30.350
There are cases however where you could have negative potential energy in the system.

05:30.350 --> 05:40.100
All right so we really it's important to use sine of charges in this equation at the end of the day.

05:40.100 --> 05:45.120
The only thing that's really going to matter is how the potential energy changes.

05:45.140 --> 05:51.110
So one thing to notice just like the force when the distance is very very far we're going to get a small

05:51.110 --> 05:58.680
number for the force and we're going to get a small amount of potential energy however one one charge

05:58.680 --> 06:01.700
is positive and one is negative.

06:01.850 --> 06:06.980
What we're going to have over here when I multiply both of these I will have a negative number for potential

06:06.980 --> 06:07.970
energy and that's OK.

06:07.970 --> 06:10.000
There's nothing wrong with that.

06:10.130 --> 06:13.340
We'll see cases where we'll see what that means in a minute.

06:13.490 --> 06:14.050
OK.
