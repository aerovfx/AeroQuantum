# Electrical Potential Energy Between Point Charges

## 03. Work, Electrical Potential Energy, and Electrical Potential

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được Vậy we're gonna start off with one of the simple cases here we're going to look at the electrical thế energy. However I am going to limit my discussion here to point các điện tích. OK. Vậy what are we knowable point các điện tích we know that we've already seen that there is a lực tác dụng lên between them and the các lực given by cool Ohm's Law and I can write it as this K Q1 Q2 and over the khoảng cách bình phương just Đúng as R bình phương. Vậy let me go out somewhere in space and imagine here this is just empty space and I place one positive điện tích here and I stick it there I glue it Vậy it can't move Vậy it is actually fixed in space. Được rồi. Bây giờ what do I do. I'm gonna go really really far away and I'm gonna go and find a another điện tích and for this case let's just xem xét a another positive điện tích. Vậy here I am out in space I'm gonna grab that positive điện tích. Được rồi. Bây giờ what happens when I bring it closer. Well when it's in this position Đúng here guess what there is a little bit of a lực tác dụng lên this điện tích. There's also a little lực tác dụng lên this one but I have something that is keeping it fixed. Vậy what happens Bây giờ. Well I'm going to apply a lực Đúng here. This is my applied lực FAA and what I want to do Bây giờ is I want to bring this điện tích and I want to place it Đúng over here. But what happens as I start bringing it closer. Đúng as I start bringing it closer it's harder for me to do that Đúng. Because imagine when I'm kind of getting close to my final position Được rồi. This here is the final position let me write that down Vậy this is final position Vậy if you think about it Bây giờ if you draw what the lực is well since it's much closer together the lực is going to be bigger and again the lực I can tính toán from cool Ohm's Law. Vậy I'm got make this véctơ down over here bigger. Được rồi. Well I had to apply a lực in order to bring that one there it's not going to get there by itself. Đúng. Vậy my applied lực for only to hold it here has to be at least as big as cool Ohm's Law. Vậy I had to do some positive work in order to bring this điện tích all the way to this final position. Vậy let me call this final spacing here. Let's call it a khoảng cách. Ah Vậy we'd be able to use this phương trình to tính toán the lực. First of all during this path remember that F.A. my applied lực does positive work the work done by the điện trường Trong trường hợp này would be negative because the lực the lực điện is like this and my độ dời is like this. Vậy the angle is 180 degrees in that case which gives me negative work. Bây giờ I can't use my phương trình unfortunately in order to tính toán the work done by the lực điện that I did previously. You can't just use f DOT and the độ dời. And the reason you can't this the reason you can't use this is because the lực is not hằng số Vậy it doesn't apply for this particular case but I'll show you how to do it Trong trường hợp này. But just remember this you've got to be a little bit careful. I can still kind of use the argument to decide whether or not the work is positive or negative I just I'm unable to use this phương trình to tính toán the work. Được rồi regardless this điện tích eventually made it to this position. Vậy there is a lực tác dụng lên it and there was some work done by this applied lực. Whenever you do some work you're going to end up storing some thế energy in the system. OK. Vậy the electrical thế energy this is a definition Bây giờ you write it all down. Bây giờ it's energy which is going to be measured in jewels. Được rồi. Vậy that's gonna be my unit at the end of the phương trình again. I'm gonna write it as you and I'm going to put a subscript e to remind me that it is electrical. Được rồi. The công thức looks pretty similar to cool Ohm's Law. Vậy chúng ta có the same hằng số k. I still have the các điện tích Q1 and Q2 except Bây giờ it gets divided only by the khoảng cách. Ah Vậy this is the phương trình pretty straightforward Bây giờ there are some differences. Energy is a scalar quantity. OK Vậy it's just a number. This here was a véctơ quantity Vậy which had a độ lớn and a hướng associated with it. Bây giờ one kind of comment about this one I was calculating các lực using my cool Ohm's law up here. I really didn't care whether was positive or negative. OK. Because positive and negative when I put the các điện tích in here they only tell me something about the hướng of the lực for thế energy. It's going to be very very important to actually put the signs of the các điện tích in here. Vậy Trong trường hợp này if this is positive and this is positive and they're separated by some khoảng cách I am going to get a positive thế energy in the system. There are cases however where you could have negative thế energy in the system. Được rồi Vậy we really it's important to use sine of các điện tích in this phương trình at the end of the day. The only thing that's really going to matter is how the thế energy changes. Vậy one thing to notice just like the lực when the khoảng cách is very very far we're going to get a small number for the lực and we're going to get a small amount of thế energy however one one điện tích is positive and one is negative. What we're going to have over here when I multiply both of these I will have a negative number for thế energy and that's OK. There's nothing wrong with that. We'll see cases where we'll see what điều đó có nghĩa là in a minute. OK.
