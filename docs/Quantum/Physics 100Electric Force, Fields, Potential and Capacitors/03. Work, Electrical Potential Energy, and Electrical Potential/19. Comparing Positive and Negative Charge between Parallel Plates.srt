00:00.120 --> 00:06.260
I want to cover this example here so we have is parallel plates.

00:06.270 --> 00:12.420
One side is positively charged the other side is negatively charged and what I'm doing now is I am placing

00:12.420 --> 00:17.670
a positive charge here inside this and I'm going to release it.

00:17.670 --> 00:21.860
I want to compare what's going to happen to the charge on the other side.

00:21.870 --> 00:30.330
I'm going to have a negative charge again I'm going to place it inside this electric field in the electric

00:30.330 --> 00:36.990
field goes from positive to negative in both cases that's represented by the green lines over here and

00:36.990 --> 00:37.440
have a look.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.640
We know that the force for this positive charge is going to be to the right.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.200
It's in the same direction as the electric field.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.720
That's easy.

00:45.720 --> 00:50.940
The force on the electron or the negative charge is going to be it's attracted to all these positive

00:50.940 --> 00:54.210
it's being repelled by all of those negatives.

00:54.460 --> 00:56.130
Force is going to be to the left.

00:56.130 --> 00:56.310
All right.

00:56.310 --> 00:58.640
This should be pretty straightforward right.

00:58.650 --> 01:04.440
Remember our force is always given by QE.

01:04.800 --> 01:10.350
So that means that if it's positive the force in the is in the same direction as the electric field.

01:10.530 --> 01:14.800
If the charge is negative the force is in the opposite direction of the field.

01:14.850 --> 01:15.380
All right.

01:15.420 --> 01:18.300
Now think about it in terms of the energy.

01:18.630 --> 01:21.780
If I release it from resin it starts to speed up.

01:21.930 --> 01:25.810
Over here we would say it has a high potential energy.

01:26.070 --> 01:28.440
That's a P stands for.

01:28.440 --> 01:33.040
On the other hand it's converting some of this potential energy into kinetic energy.

01:33.090 --> 01:35.700
But again the total energy has to be conserved.

01:36.030 --> 01:40.260
So over here the potential energy goes down.

01:40.600 --> 01:41.140
All right.

01:41.140 --> 01:42.480
Same thing with this one.

01:42.490 --> 01:42.870
OK.

01:42.880 --> 01:48.640
This one here starts with high potential energy and let's say that the kinetic energy initially 0 for

01:48.640 --> 01:56.140
that one Katie kinetic energy is high over here so that the total when you add both of those contributions

01:56.140 --> 02:00.020
up has to be a constant.

02:00.020 --> 02:05.990
So again we're starting with high potential energy even though it's negative it's close to another negative.

02:06.230 --> 02:09.020
When you multiply those together you're going to get a positive number.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.390
That's a high potential energy.

02:11.480 --> 02:18.090
So both charges move from high potential energy toward low potential energy because they speed up right.

02:18.110 --> 02:22.370
They get some kinetic energy at the end kinetic energy over here is high.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.890
If I have low potential energy.

02:24.890 --> 02:30.290
Now what makes them different is the last thing I remember we always talk about electrical potential

02:30.890 --> 02:34.810
the electrical potential is higher and it's positive.

02:34.810 --> 02:36.390
Near the positive plate.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.180
That's true for both of them.

02:38.210 --> 02:45.350
Look what happens to charges positive charges move from high potential toward low potential.

02:45.380 --> 02:51.060
Yeah that's the direction of the electric field that's what we said but look what happens to negative

02:51.060 --> 02:54.470
charges negative charges do the opposite.

02:54.510 --> 02:58.950
But that makes sense when you draw it out but they move from low electrical potential.

02:58.960 --> 02:59.190
Right.

02:59.190 --> 03:06.360
It could be like negative 50 volts on the side it might be positive 50 volts a negative charge wants

03:06.360 --> 03:13.570
to move toward a region wave of high electrical potential and when it moves here it actually lowers

03:13.570 --> 03:15.720
its potential energy.

03:15.730 --> 03:16.050
OK.

03:16.060 --> 03:20.140
So being able to distinguish potential energy from potential.

03:20.140 --> 03:20.800
All right.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.530
Hopefully this example kind of shed some light on it.

03:23.560 --> 03:29.080
Again I always like to put some numbers to some of these variables sometimes just to make it clear to

03:29.080 --> 03:29.580
me.

03:29.680 --> 03:30.010
Oh yeah.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.250
If it's a positively charged plate let me just say is plus 50 volts.

03:34.260 --> 03:35.020
That's negative.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.610
Let me set it as negative 50 volts.

03:36.610 --> 03:39.520
Now it's clear what the positive charge wants to do.

03:39.770 --> 03:40.030
All right.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.000
All right.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.180
Hopefully this makes a little bit more sense to you.
