00:00.150 --> 00:04.080
All right so let's imagine we have this for Coolum charge here.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.960
And again if I release it's positive.

00:06.960 --> 00:12.000
So it wants to be repelled by these positives and wants to be attracted by the negatives.

00:12.000 --> 00:12.720
Right.

00:12.720 --> 00:18.250
So it's going to have an electric force acting on it in this direction right here.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.100
Let's calculate.

00:19.110 --> 00:20.280
So it's going to speed up.

00:20.280 --> 00:20.450
Right.

00:20.450 --> 00:23.810
If I release it from ress be right before hit the plate.

00:23.820 --> 00:25.980
It should be moving pretty fast.

00:25.990 --> 00:27.330
The question's pretty straightforward.

00:27.330 --> 00:31.530
Let's calculate the work done by this electric field.

00:31.620 --> 00:32.000
All right.

00:32.030 --> 00:38.760
So the definition is the magnitude of the force and scalar product with the displacement in the vertical

00:38.760 --> 00:39.770
direction.

00:39.780 --> 00:40.020
All right.

00:40.350 --> 00:45.180
So the way I write that down in terms of the quantities it would be the forces the electric force the

00:45.180 --> 00:51.390
displacement the magnitude is delta y and coast of the angle between the force and the displacement.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.650
That's the work done by this electric force.

00:55.710 --> 01:00.780
All right how do we write the electric force I write it as the charge which has four columns multiplied

01:00.780 --> 01:07.440
by the electric field the displacement now I was going to write the displacement as a vector I mean

01:07.440 --> 01:09.240
this is what the displacement looks like.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.510
Right.

01:10.740 --> 01:14.060
And the magnitude is simply the distance between the plates.

01:14.100 --> 01:18.660
So I'm just going to write this is D guy and coasts of the angle.

01:18.660 --> 01:22.740
Now what's the angle between the force and the displacement.

01:22.740 --> 01:25.460
Again both of those vectors point in the same direction.

01:25.470 --> 01:28.640
So I'd have coast of zero degrees right here.

01:28.740 --> 01:28.970
All right.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.950
So the work done by the electric field boils down to something pretty straightforward.

01:33.150 --> 01:35.120
QED.

01:35.390 --> 01:35.690
All right.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.370
So we could just substitute the numbers we get for cool homes our electric field magnitude is two hundred

01:41.380 --> 01:48.800
and fifty and the distance between the plate is six centimetres zero point zero six.

01:48.890 --> 01:51.130
All right that is the work done by the electric field.

01:51.140 --> 01:51.370
All right.

01:51.370 --> 01:54.360
So my final answer now is a numerical number.

01:54.460 --> 02:03.580
What I would get would be four times 250 times zero point zero six gives me 60 Joules.

02:03.650 --> 02:05.660
Notice the number is positive.

02:05.660 --> 02:11.630
Does that make sense to you it's positive because the force and the displacement are parallel to each

02:11.630 --> 02:11.870
other.

02:11.860 --> 02:13.500
They're in the same direction.

02:13.550 --> 02:18.130
So the work does the field does positive work.

02:18.170 --> 02:18.470
All right.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.120
So kind of a nice little example.
