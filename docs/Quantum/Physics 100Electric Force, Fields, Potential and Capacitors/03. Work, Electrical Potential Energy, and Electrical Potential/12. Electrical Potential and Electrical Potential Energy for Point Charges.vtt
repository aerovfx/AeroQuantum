Did this example in a previous video we calculate the electrical potential energy.

00:05.550 --> 00:13.050
If I had a two micro cooling charge and a four micro cool ohm charge separated by three meters.

00:13.050 --> 00:13.390
All right.

00:13.410 --> 00:19.050
Well again now for there to be potential energy we need both of these charges to be there.

00:19.100 --> 00:20.820
And again this is a scalar quantity.

00:20.820 --> 00:24.120
This number could be positive if it was a positive a negative.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.730
We show examples where the potential energy could be negative.

00:28.750 --> 00:33.630
All right now the question is what happens if we only have one charge.

00:33.630 --> 00:38.370
Well if we only have one charge or we're gonna do is we're going to get rid of this one.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.670
Let's get rid of the four micro cooling for now.

00:41.670 --> 00:42.030
All right.

00:43.240 --> 00:48.330
Well if I only have one charge I mean I'm going to have to place some point here I'm going to call it

00:48.390 --> 00:55.650
a point P again if we only have one charge we don't have potential energy because there's only one charge.

00:55.800 --> 01:00.420
But again let's have a look at what the equation would look like if we only had one charge.

01:00.420 --> 01:06.480
Well now I'm going to call this quantity V which is different and I'm going to keep everything else

01:06.480 --> 01:17.880
the same k q 1 and divided by R KS the same Q would be the magnitude of this charge and R are now has

01:17.880 --> 01:19.290
a different meaning right.

01:19.290 --> 01:25.670
R is now the distance from the charge to the point where I want to evaluate this quantity V.

01:25.830 --> 01:28.570
This is what we call the electrical potential.

01:30.420 --> 01:34.280
And it's the electrical potential produced by a point charge.

01:34.330 --> 01:35.820
It's also very important.

01:36.250 --> 01:36.540
OK.

01:36.570 --> 01:44.750
So this is really this discussion I'm having here is four point charges so let's go ahead and calculate

01:44.750 --> 01:49.220
this value so we just substitute the values in there right.

01:49.230 --> 01:56.040
We have nine times 10 to the nine I have q one which is to micro Coolum

01:59.290 --> 01:59.980
and what else.

01:59.980 --> 02:04.340
Now I have to divide by three and that's it.

02:04.390 --> 02:07.800
So V at the end of the day is let me put that in the calculator nine.

02:07.810 --> 02:14.110
Each of the nine times to e to the negative six and divided by three.

02:14.110 --> 02:18.090
This gives me a number of six thousand.

02:18.190 --> 02:20.410
Now what are the units of this value.

02:20.410 --> 02:28.600
Well it's kind of like this equation and the potential energy was joules except I've removed one of

02:28.600 --> 02:30.150
the charges.

02:30.250 --> 02:35.010
Okay this is what we call a jewel per Coolum right.

02:35.050 --> 02:44.230
So this quantity V is how much energy you have per charge so let's just write this down as a V.

02:44.710 --> 02:55.390
The units of it are in jewels per Coolum and this means it's energy that we have per unit charge.

02:55.580 --> 02:56.740
We simplify this.

02:56.770 --> 02:56.980
OK.

02:56.990 --> 02:58.520
We give this a special name.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.450
This is what we call a Volt.

03:01.770 --> 03:05.780
And this is something that we're a little bit more familiar in everyday life.

03:05.780 --> 03:06.920
You hear this term a lot.

03:06.920 --> 03:12.310
Volts go volts is a unit of potential.

03:12.370 --> 03:12.750
Okay.

03:12.770 --> 03:14.370
So this is really really important.

03:14.660 --> 03:21.590
So a lot of times I'm just gonna write sic V equals to six thousand volts in this case.

03:21.650 --> 03:22.370
That's it.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.590
That's the same thing.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.850
So one jewel per cool ohm is equivalent to one volt.

03:27.860 --> 03:33.770
So the question is now all what if I know this electrical potential is six thousand right here.

03:33.770 --> 03:36.470
That's what we just calculated.

03:36.480 --> 03:42.100
Well I'm going to go ahead now and I'm going to place a nother charge right here at this position.

03:42.260 --> 03:49.310
This charge is going to have a value of 4 micro cooling similar to what we did before.

03:49.370 --> 03:55.280
How could I calculate what is the potential energy now in the system using the fact that I know I have

03:55.280 --> 03:58.770
six thousand volts at that point.

03:58.910 --> 04:02.650
So this is a really important equation right here.

04:02.700 --> 04:09.380
I think about it here I can write that the potential energy is if you look at the first part of my potential

04:09.380 --> 04:10.760
energy right here.

04:11.180 --> 04:19.040
This guy here is really what our volt equation was what the potential was do at the end.

04:19.070 --> 04:26.750
I can always write an electrical potential as a charge in this case if the charge for micro cooling

04:27.170 --> 04:32.690
multiplied by the electrical potential at that specific point.

04:32.730 --> 04:37.990
So in this case the formula would look like this I'm going to place a four micro cooling charge here

04:38.750 --> 04:45.970
10 to the negative 6 and I'm placing it at a position where the voltage or the electrical potential

04:45.970 --> 04:52.610
produced by this 2 Micro cooling charge is six thousand volts.

04:52.860 --> 04:57.160
I guess what we get at the end of the day we're going to get the same thing as we would is if we use

04:57.160 --> 05:03.760
the top equation right here and this number was zero point zero to four and that answer has to be in

05:03.760 --> 05:08.220
units of joules that is the potential energy.

05:08.250 --> 05:08.490
All right.

05:08.520 --> 05:15.390
So we've used we've introduced this concept and it's actually a really powerful because if we know the

05:15.390 --> 05:22.530
electrical potential anywhere in space if we know it's six thousand it's very very easy to calculate

05:22.560 --> 05:26.790
what the total energy is simply by multiplying by whatever charge we have here.
