00:00.240 --> 00:00.480
All right.

00:00.510 --> 00:05.220
Have a look at two kind of silly examples over here we only have two point chargers in the top figure

00:05.630 --> 00:11.180
and we want to use my equation to calculate now the total electrical potential energy in the system.

00:11.700 --> 00:17.190
So I have two micro columns and a four micro column point charger separated by three meters.

00:17.190 --> 00:20.170
So again the formula is exactly the same.

00:20.340 --> 00:25.290
So we have nine times 10 to the 9 that's the K value same as before.

00:25.290 --> 00:29.210
And now I'm going to have two times ten to the negative six.

00:29.210 --> 00:33.080
I'm going to have four times 10 to the negative six.

00:33.210 --> 00:37.140
And at the end here I have to divide by the distance and it's only three.

00:37.140 --> 00:39.480
So you've got gotta be a little bit careful and that's it.

00:39.480 --> 00:45.540
Now we put the number in the calculator and we get zero point zero to four.

00:45.540 --> 00:48.660
Now that is measured in Joules pretty straightforward.

00:48.660 --> 00:49.680
How about the second case.

00:49.680 --> 00:58.320
So this case a little bit different to micro column a negative 5 micro column and separated by 5 meters

00:58.320 --> 00:59.790
in this case.

00:59.790 --> 01:03.220
What is the electrical potential energy in the system.

01:03.230 --> 01:07.050
So I would go nine times 10 to the nine what else.

01:07.050 --> 01:10.390
Two times ten to the negative six.

01:10.500 --> 01:10.830
Ha.

01:10.830 --> 01:11.880
Now the key here.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.740
Notice I have the negative side.

01:13.740 --> 01:21.390
Negative five times 10 to the negative six and divided by five in this case.

01:21.390 --> 01:26.850
All right put that number in the calculator and lo and behold I'm gonna get a negative number and zero

01:26.850 --> 01:28.870
point zero one eight.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.680
Jules this is OK.

01:31.830 --> 01:32.880
This can be negative.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.240
OK.

01:33.270 --> 01:35.160
So don't let that scare you.

01:35.310 --> 01:42.210
Right what if I did a third case and let's just keep it rather simple instead of having a positive to

01:42.210 --> 01:43.050
micro cool on.

01:43.050 --> 01:46.840
Let's have a negative in this case and another negative.

01:46.840 --> 01:52.770
We'll keep this one the same minus five micro cool on and let's convert this one to negative to micro

01:52.770 --> 01:55.500
cool on and we'll keep the same spacing.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.760
Let's see what happens in this case.

01:57.810 --> 02:06.000
Again the formula is the same again it's going to look the exact same except 10 to the 9.

02:06.510 --> 02:06.870
OK.

02:06.870 --> 02:11.640
Now I've switched the sine here so it's important for me to have that sign here because I'm calculating

02:11.640 --> 02:13.190
a scalar quantity.

02:13.410 --> 02:16.680
And actually the sign is important.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.090
Times 10 to the negative 6.

02:18.090 --> 02:22.490
So both of those are negative charges and multiply.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.510
Sorry divided by five meters again.

02:24.510 --> 02:29.430
So what are we going to get in this case again these two negative signs are going to cancel out and

02:29.430 --> 02:34.050
we're going to be left with a positive zero point zero one eight jewels.

02:34.830 --> 02:40.950
So notice when I have two positive charges I'm going to have positive potential energy when I have two

02:40.950 --> 02:41.730
negatives.

02:41.730 --> 02:44.980
I'm also going to have positive potential energy.

02:45.180 --> 02:50.730
And when I have charges that are of different sign like in the second case right here I'm going to end

02:50.730 --> 02:54.330
up having negative electrical potential energy.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.870
And that's OK.

02:55.920 --> 03:02.160
Now the other thing to notice is that when r gets very very big when it tends toward infinity the electrical

03:02.160 --> 03:05.070
potential energy tends toward zero.

03:05.340 --> 03:06.420
OK.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.400
So that's kind of the other important thing.

03:08.400 --> 03:08.570
All right.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.710
If you understand this we're off to the races.
