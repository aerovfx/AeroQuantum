00:00.140 --> 00:05.940
And now I want to again illustrate this with another example how he can use conservation of energy in

00:05.940 --> 00:07.410
order to solve problems.

00:07.410 --> 00:11.340
So here's the problem I have I have again my two micro cooling charge.

00:11.340 --> 00:19.680
I'm going to assume that that charge is fixed in space and 30 meters away I'm going to place a negative

00:19.680 --> 00:21.480
three micro cooling charge.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.770
So those are attracted to each other.

00:23.820 --> 00:29.850
I'm going to release the negative three micro cooling charge so it's going to have a force acting toward

00:29.850 --> 00:30.780
the positive one.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.240
And it's going to start to speed up.

00:33.270 --> 00:38.940
So the question is when it's five meters away now how fast is the charge moving.

00:38.940 --> 00:40.620
All right so I've got it illustrated above.

00:40.620 --> 00:43.320
So this is the speed that I'm looking for.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.510
So let's go see how we can use conservation of energy.

00:46.530 --> 00:52.320
Look at the total energy at one position the initial and set that equal to the total energy of the final

00:52.320 --> 00:55.130
position and then solve for the unknown.

00:55.140 --> 01:01.320
The nice thing about using conservation of energy is you typically only have one equation to solve for.

01:01.350 --> 01:01.580
OK.

01:01.590 --> 01:06.240
That's the conservation of energy so if you're able to write down that statement you look at what the

01:06.240 --> 01:12.400
unknown is and that's typically what you have to solve for let me show you how you use conservation

01:12.400 --> 01:14.380
of energy now to solve this problem.

01:14.380 --> 01:19.870
So again the total energy at the initial position is the kinetic plus the initial potential and that

01:19.870 --> 01:24.360
has to be equal to the final kinetic plus the final potential.

01:24.380 --> 01:30.190
Now we can substitute here again if I'm releasing the particle here the charge from arrest.

01:30.190 --> 01:33.180
They don't have to worry about the initial kinetic energy.

01:33.350 --> 01:38.800
I will have some initial electrical potential energy and I will have some final right because I'm not

01:38.800 --> 01:41.850
at an infinite distance away anywhere.

01:41.860 --> 01:47.110
So I do have to keep all these other terms I'm looking for the speed and the speed is going to be tucked

01:47.110 --> 01:49.390
inside this final kinetic energy.

01:49.430 --> 01:51.850
Let's start writing down our expressions.

01:52.000 --> 01:52.870
So that's what we have.

01:52.870 --> 01:58.890
K. Q1 Q2 divided by our 1 are our initial rather.

01:59.110 --> 02:05.680
That's my initial potential energy at equals 2 1 1/2 m v final squared.

02:05.680 --> 02:15.010
That's our final kinetic energy and plus K. Q1 Q2 divided by our final by our final in this case is

02:15.010 --> 02:16.510
five meters.

02:16.510 --> 02:23.110
So now we have to do a little bit of algebra in order to get an expression for the speed you could substitute

02:23.110 --> 02:26.660
the numbers here and get numbers for all this and that's fine there's nothing wrong with that.

02:26.770 --> 02:30.920
I'm going to just do it algebraic Lee for now and at the end I'll get one number.

02:31.110 --> 02:31.390
OK.

02:31.420 --> 02:36.700
So I'm going to bring this final potential energy on the other side.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.190
OK.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.700
And I'll bring the kinetic energy.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.770
Let me just write it like this.

02:41.770 --> 02:41.970
All right.

02:41.980 --> 02:47.290
So my kinetic energy my final kinetic energy then becomes somebody whose terms are the same so I can

02:47.290 --> 02:48.490
actually factor them out.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.000
That's pretty easy.

02:50.020 --> 02:56.500
And here I'm going to get one divided by our initial minus one divided by our final.

02:56.500 --> 02:56.700
OK.

02:56.730 --> 02:58.510
So that's not too bad.

02:58.510 --> 02:59.470
And now some of the math.

02:59.470 --> 03:05.320
Now if I want to just get one final expression I'm going to get V final there's going to be a square

03:05.320 --> 03:08.890
root and it's gonna be kind of a lengthy term.

03:08.950 --> 03:19.720
All right it's going to be two K Q1 Q2 divided by the mass and again I have this term here of 1 divided

03:19.720 --> 03:24.270
by our initial minus 1 divided by our final.

03:24.270 --> 03:24.530
OK.

03:24.610 --> 03:27.400
So we could start substituting the numbers in here now

03:30.500 --> 03:32.000
and everything is going to work out.

03:32.010 --> 03:34.180
Again we have to put in all the signs.

03:34.230 --> 03:34.500
OK.

03:34.530 --> 03:39.090
So we have to we have nine times tend to the nine.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.770
That's the K value.

03:40.770 --> 03:46.890
The first charge is to micro cool on positive to tend to the negative six.

03:46.890 --> 03:49.130
The second one was negative.

03:49.230 --> 03:54.360
Don't worry the negative side is not going to appear under the square root at the end you'll see that

03:54.360 --> 03:58.000
the term in the bracket here is also going to be negative.

03:58.170 --> 04:01.810
So this charges negative three micro columns.

04:02.020 --> 04:10.060
I'm going to divide by the mass of the mass I said was 2.5 times 10 to the negative three for this problem.

04:10.390 --> 04:11.120
OK.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.710
And now I still have this remaining term.

04:14.040 --> 04:17.660
So 1 divided by the initial which is 30.

04:17.670 --> 04:24.040
That's gonna be a small number minus one over five okay.

04:24.070 --> 04:29.470
So after evaluating then the calculator you should get a number that looks like did things correctly

04:29.470 --> 04:34.820
I think I got a number that was approximately two point seven meters per second.

04:35.560 --> 04:35.910
Okay.

04:35.920 --> 04:41.290
So that's kind of how you would do a problem like this using conservation of energy.

04:41.410 --> 04:45.970
All right really really powerful technique especially when they're asking you for quantities that are

04:45.970 --> 04:48.220
scalar is like calculating the speed.
