The follow up question to this would be how can we now calculate how much work was done in order to

00:05.910 --> 00:07.460
build the system.

00:07.620 --> 00:11.090
Right so we brought the first charge here and then we went all the way really far.

00:11.090 --> 00:16.580
Then we brought this second four micro cool on charge and kept the first one fixed right.

00:16.610 --> 00:24.340
We put potential energy into the system so the way you calculate work by any conservative force.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.480
Let me just read it like this.

00:26.760 --> 00:32.040
And conservative force so this could apply to anything.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.990
Now remember the force is not constant.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.600
So we can't really use just the force multiplied by the displacement guy.

00:40.050 --> 00:46.860
However whenever there is a conservative force we always have a potential energy associated with it.

00:46.890 --> 00:50.970
And for the electric force this is the potential energy.

00:50.970 --> 00:54.460
So the way you calculate the work done by the conservative force.

00:54.510 --> 00:56.980
Let me not forget this right here.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.210
Right force down here.

01:00.210 --> 01:02.100
In this case it's the electrical force.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.890
It's always minus the change in the potential energy.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.250
So let me show you how you would apply to this system.

01:11.250 --> 01:20.610
So again if I do negative a change it's always a final value of potential energy minus an initial value.

01:20.610 --> 01:26.070
If you bring this negative side through you multiply through in this case it ends up being the initial

01:26.070 --> 01:30.500
potential energy minus the final potential energy.

01:30.510 --> 01:30.710
All right.

01:30.720 --> 01:36.180
This is what we calculated for our problem here this here is really the final potential energy of the

01:36.180 --> 01:37.820
system.

01:37.980 --> 01:40.140
What is the initial potential energy.

01:40.140 --> 01:46.800
Well initial is when this charger was really really far away when it was far away the initial is actually

01:47.100 --> 01:52.740
this guy right here because we had to go get it from somewhere and then place it here.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.700
So the initial potential energy for us is zero.

01:55.710 --> 02:04.320
And my final is this so I can calculate that the work done in this case by the electric force is going

02:04.320 --> 02:09.180
to be negative zero point zero to four joules.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.870
So why is it negative.

02:10.930 --> 02:19.260
OK it's important understand why it's negative again as you're bringing this charge closer.

02:19.260 --> 02:25.560
This guy here was fixed kind of glued it there as you're bringing the second one closer remember there

02:25.560 --> 02:33.390
is an electric force acting on it but as I brought it closer the displacement is actually in this direction

02:35.380 --> 02:39.600
now although I can't use the equation force times displacement to calculate it.

02:39.750 --> 02:44.270
I can still use it just to look at is the work going to be positive or negative.

02:44.390 --> 02:50.970
And in this case the force is this way the displacement is this way when those when those two vectors

02:51.000 --> 02:57.030
are opposite of each other you always get a 180 degrees between them that would always give you a negative

02:57.030 --> 02:58.050
work.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.650
So the electric field does negative work in this problem.

03:02.650 --> 03:09.450
That means that my applied force would do the opposite of that.

03:10.230 --> 03:15.090
And in this case this would be zero point zero to four joules OK.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.330
So I would end up doing positive work and this is how much work I did.

03:19.380 --> 03:22.280
This is how much energy I've stored in this system.
