00:00.090 --> 00:02.660
Here's some of the key information for this problem here.

00:02.670 --> 00:07.800
So we have a charged particle in this case it's going to be a proton if it's a proton.

00:07.800 --> 00:13.980
We know the charge here is given by one point six times tend to the negative 19 columns and it's a proton.

00:13.980 --> 00:19.260
Just look up this number we also know the mass of that charge which is one point six seven times tend

00:19.260 --> 00:21.930
to the negative 27 kilograms.

00:21.930 --> 00:27.810
Now I've got parallel plates that I've previously charged by connecting it to a battery and the separation

00:27.810 --> 00:33.090
between the plates is one centimeter and I have a certain amount of charge here positive charge on one

00:33.090 --> 00:38.820
plate negative charge on the other plate such that the electric field produced by these charges over

00:38.820 --> 00:41.620
here is ten thousand Nunes per Coolum.

00:41.700 --> 00:41.910
All right.

00:41.910 --> 00:47.400
The first thing to consider is what happens when this charge particles moving upward over here and it's

00:47.400 --> 00:52.650
going to enter the field region over here at some point the charge particle will enter this region over

00:52.650 --> 00:53.310
here.

00:53.310 --> 00:57.070
Now what happens when this charged particle is in the field region.

00:57.150 --> 01:00.400
The first thing you have to do is let's do a free body diagram.

01:00.400 --> 01:07.050
OK just see what are all the forces acting on this charge when it's in this electric field.

01:07.070 --> 01:10.850
OK so the free body diagram for this proton here is pretty straightforward.

01:10.860 --> 01:13.050
Let's just draw the proton over here.

01:13.110 --> 01:16.100
If you look at it first of all this is a positive charge right.

01:16.110 --> 01:22.080
It's a small positive charge little Q and when it's in that field first thing you have to realize is

01:22.080 --> 01:26.290
there's going to be an electric force acting on this charge.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.680
Electric force is a vector and that vector is going to point downward because it is being repelled by

01:31.680 --> 01:36.740
the positive charge over here and it's being attracted by the negatively charged plate.

01:36.780 --> 01:41.210
So the magnitude of this electric force is given by QE.

01:41.310 --> 01:41.550
All right.

01:41.550 --> 01:42.470
And that's really important.

01:42.470 --> 01:47.940
And the force is in the same direction as the electric field in this case because this guy here is a

01:47.940 --> 01:49.080
positive charge.

01:49.080 --> 01:49.280
Right.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.440
So we have two vectors that are in the same direction.

01:52.530 --> 01:57.690
The next thing you do now is you apply new second lot of this problem a new second law says you add

01:57.690 --> 02:00.120
up all the forces acting on that charge.

02:00.180 --> 02:04.810
In this case all the forces are in that vertical direction here and there's only one force.

02:04.830 --> 02:11.230
So when that atom all up it's simply the electric force and you add them all up that has to be equal

02:11.230 --> 02:13.960
to the mass times the acceleration.

02:13.960 --> 02:19.420
And that means that while hey the acceleration is going to be in the same direction as the electric

02:19.420 --> 02:20.610
force.

02:20.710 --> 02:26.130
So the electric saw the acceleration in this case we can get the magnitude of it.

02:26.140 --> 02:31.480
You simply have to divide through by the mass and let's substitute our value for the electric force.

02:32.290 --> 02:36.100
So at the end of the day what we end up getting is this fairly important equation over here is that

02:36.100 --> 02:42.760
the acceleration which is Q times the magnitude of the electric field and I end up dividing through

02:42.760 --> 02:45.630
by the mass over here to isolate the acceleration.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.080
And this is what I'm left with.

02:48.930 --> 02:54.700
Now we can actually get a number for acceleration here in the key point about this guy here is going

02:54.700 --> 03:00.400
to be in the same direction as the electric field because the charge is positive and mass is always

03:00.400 --> 03:01.320
positive.

03:01.330 --> 03:06.070
So really the direction of the acceleration here this is in the down direction.

03:06.160 --> 03:06.680
All right.

03:06.700 --> 03:11.150
The other important thing to consider about this problem is this guy over here right.

03:11.170 --> 03:14.370
The electric field for this problem is constant.

03:14.390 --> 03:14.560
Right.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.950
This is a constant which means it's uniform.

03:17.950 --> 03:18.160
Right.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.060
And if we're between these parallel plates the electric field is pretty much uniform.

03:22.270 --> 03:26.110
So that means that this acceleration here is also constant.

03:26.110 --> 03:28.630
It is also constant.

03:28.740 --> 03:33.630
And the reason that this is a really really important for this problem is that if the acceleration is

03:33.630 --> 03:36.470
constant we can now do simple Kitimat.

03:36.500 --> 03:41.790
So let's go ahead and set up some kid thematics for this problem to analyze the motion of the charged

03:41.790 --> 03:44.870
particle between the two parallel plates.

03:44.910 --> 03:49.220
We're gonna have two important kinetic equations here again our acceleration is constant.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.430
Here's the magnitude the direction we know is down.

03:52.620 --> 03:56.590
So the kinetic equations are going to be a number one and number two here.

03:56.610 --> 04:00.980
Number one let's just look at the vertical displacement of this charge particle.

04:01.020 --> 04:05.550
That's the Y position y position is going to be equal to y 0.

04:05.850 --> 04:08.880
Plus the initial velocity multiplied by time.

04:09.120 --> 04:14.040
And I'm just gonna stick a negative front in this in the front of the acceleration turn because it's

04:14.040 --> 04:17.480
slowing down and the acceleration is down.

04:17.530 --> 04:22.700
It's in the down direction and I'm defining that down direction to be the negative direction.

04:22.740 --> 04:22.950
All right.

04:22.950 --> 04:26.600
This is my coordinate system here for this particular problem.

04:26.610 --> 04:30.300
Everything pointing up is positive everything pointing down is negative.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.850
So I've just taken that out of the equation.

04:32.880 --> 04:37.340
The other thing we need to know for this problem is what is the velocity of the charge particle.

04:37.350 --> 04:43.470
Right when it enters this field region its velocity was initially going up but since the acceleration

04:43.470 --> 04:47.350
is down that means that the charge will slow down.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.040
OK.

04:48.150 --> 04:53.690
It's going to slow down and the expression for the velocity is simply going to be like this.

04:53.700 --> 04:59.790
The initial velocity and again I'll just take the negative sign out multiplied by acceleration times

04:59.790 --> 05:04.980
time and now you could see that having this negative sign here is really going to make the velocity

05:05.010 --> 05:08.910
kind of slow down as time increases.

05:08.910 --> 05:09.170
All right.

05:09.210 --> 05:15.900
So we have our two equations and now what we want here is we want our maximum displacement in the y

05:15.900 --> 05:22.260
velocity we actually want the charge particle to actually come and just touch the plate and then come

05:22.260 --> 05:23.970
back down like this.

05:24.360 --> 05:31.960
So what we want here really is that our y displacement for this problem is what we want.

05:32.080 --> 05:41.320
We want delta y which is my final minus the initial we want this to be the spacing between the plates.

05:42.010 --> 05:42.880
That's really important.

05:42.880 --> 05:47.950
And the other important thing to do is if we want the charge particle to reach this point there is also

05:47.950 --> 05:49.570
something else that's going to happen here.

05:49.570 --> 05:53.760
So what happens is is going really fast it starts the slow down slow down slow down.

05:53.950 --> 06:02.050
Up until it reaches this point at this maximum y displacement we want the vertical velocity here to

06:02.050 --> 06:03.690
be equal to zero.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.770
Right right at the turnaround point.

06:05.770 --> 06:10.660
And then after it's going to start speeding up it's speeding up in the down direction.

06:10.660 --> 06:15.970
So right at this point here this is really important expression here is that our vertical velocity has

06:15.970 --> 06:17.960
to be equal to zero.

06:17.980 --> 06:24.090
So now if we go back here and consider our equation to Well if you substitute now v y is equal to zero

06:24.100 --> 06:29.080
what you can do is you can find how much time it takes for this charge particle to slow down and to

06:29.080 --> 06:32.170
reach this point over here.

06:32.170 --> 06:34.610
So let's go ahead and do that we can calculate that.

06:34.630 --> 06:35.740
And what you're going to find here.

06:35.740 --> 06:43.180
So go and substitute it into equation 2 We want zero equal to my initial velocity and minus the acceleration

06:43.180 --> 06:49.900
times time and now what I do is simply substitute the expression for the acceleration that expression

06:49.900 --> 06:55.810
for acceleration was the magnitude of the charge magnitude of the field divided by the mass and multiplied

06:55.810 --> 06:57.040
by the time.

06:57.130 --> 07:00.300
So at the end the time for the velocity to reach zero.

07:00.300 --> 07:01.920
You simply have to do a little bit of algebra.

07:01.930 --> 07:08.310
Now bring this on the other side and divide through by this term here in the bracket.

07:08.410 --> 07:15.150
I'm going to rearrange things a little bit and my expression is going to look like this so this is how

07:15.150 --> 07:19.590
much time it takes for the velocity to be equal to zero.

07:20.600 --> 07:20.810
All right.

07:20.810 --> 07:25.610
The next thing we want to do now is well we know what our vertical displacement is.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.750
All we have to do now is go back to equation 1.

07:28.810 --> 07:32.000
Now we have the time now that we could substitute in here.

07:32.150 --> 07:37.190
And my goal now will be simply to solve what is that initial velocity so that it makes it all the way

07:37.190 --> 07:38.240
to the other plate.

07:38.270 --> 07:42.030
So let's go ahead on the other page and do this math all right.

07:42.030 --> 07:47.460
The next thing we want and now is we wanted our vertical displacement rewrite equation one over here.

07:47.470 --> 07:53.190
This tells me my y position equals the initial position plus initial velocity times.

07:53.190 --> 07:57.480
Time and again minus one half 80 squared.

07:57.480 --> 08:06.590
And really what we want in this case we want our delta y to be equal to the spacing between the plates.

08:06.590 --> 08:07.810
So let's go ahead and do that.

08:07.880 --> 08:11.710
If we do that is bring this guy on the other side and that becomes delta y.

08:11.710 --> 08:15.450
All right delta y is always a Y minus some initial value.

08:15.860 --> 08:20.870
So let's simplify equation 1 so we get that the distance between the plates and this is really what

08:20.870 --> 08:28.510
we want time minus one half a T squared now the next thing we have remember is how much time it takes

08:28.510 --> 08:30.400
for when the velocity equals to zero.

08:30.400 --> 08:30.580
Right.

08:30.580 --> 08:33.920
And we just want that charge particle to reach the other plate.

08:33.940 --> 08:38.330
So all you have to do now is simply substitute the time for our expression up above.

08:38.330 --> 08:38.900
Okay.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.230
And you could also substitute acceleration for now.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.450
Let me just kind of do it this way.

08:43.570 --> 08:48.820
Let's go over here so we have the distance between the plates.

08:48.880 --> 08:55.210
I'll just keep the v y over here and for my expression for time now rather than doing the second expression

08:55.210 --> 09:00.700
let's just start off with just this one v zero divided by the acceleration that'll make the math a little

09:00.700 --> 09:01.560
bit easier.

09:01.630 --> 09:04.860
We won't have so many variables to tackle over here.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.070
Let's keep acceleration like this.

09:07.240 --> 09:13.270
And now we have this T squared and T again is initial velocity divided by acceleration and we square

09:13.270 --> 09:14.640
that term.

09:14.680 --> 09:21.970
Now you do a little bit of algebra what you end up getting is you get v 0 squared divided by a and then

09:21.970 --> 09:23.250
minus one half.

09:23.260 --> 09:28.540
And if you look at this other term here this becomes a and this becomes v zero squared and this becomes

09:28.660 --> 09:30.100
a squared.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.880
I have a look at this term you have an a here and you have two of them over here so you can get rid

09:33.880 --> 09:39.800
of one and these two terms are exactly the same except the second one has a coefficient of 1 1/2 in

09:39.790 --> 09:40.960
the front of it.

09:41.050 --> 09:51.340
So at the end this is our expression for our displacement is 1 1/2 v 0 squared divided by acceleration.

09:51.340 --> 09:51.550
All right.

09:51.550 --> 09:56.620
And remember our problem right the acceleration for this problem we know what it was the acceleration

09:56.620 --> 10:03.220
was pretty straightforward It was the charge multiplied by the electric field and divided by the mass

10:03.220 --> 10:05.790
and rather than putting the mass kind of down below.

10:05.950 --> 10:10.480
If I'm dividing I could just bring it to the top over here and this is my final expression over here

10:10.480 --> 10:15.250
for the distance between the plates which I know.

10:15.460 --> 10:19.380
So the only unknown now in this problem is what is v zero.

10:19.390 --> 10:23.530
So we have to do a little bit of math over here just isolate the V zero you bring a couple terms over

10:23.530 --> 10:25.090
to the other side.

10:25.090 --> 10:30.980
Divide by the mass and then take the square root of everything and this is what we end up getting.

10:31.010 --> 10:35.770
So v zero end up the square root of a whole bunch of different terms here.

10:35.840 --> 10:43.550
So we get to Q The distance between the plates multiplied by the electric field and all of this gets

10:43.550 --> 10:47.210
divided by by the mass all right here.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.430
Here we have it folks.

10:48.460 --> 10:55.090
So this would be the velocity such that if you give that charged particle that proton this velocity

10:55.090 --> 11:01.380
over here you're gonna end up that the charge particle is just going to make it to the other side.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.650
Okay so all you have to do now is simply substitute in the numbers.

11:04.780 --> 11:05.790
Let's go ahead and do that.

11:06.810 --> 11:10.030
You substitute the numbers over here we get kind of a big expression.

11:10.270 --> 11:19.460
We'll get to one point six times ten to the negative 19 the distance between the plates was 1 centimeter.

11:19.550 --> 11:22.520
So this is zero point zero one meter.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.420
What else.

11:23.420 --> 11:28.070
The electric field was 10000 10000 Newtons per cool.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.660
That's already an S.I. units we don't have to convert anything in the last part.

11:31.660 --> 11:38.490
Here was the mass the mass is one point six seven times ten to the negative twenty seven kilograms.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.110
Put that all put all of that in the calculator.

11:41.230 --> 11:45.690
You should get something like this one point three eight times tend to the five.

11:45.910 --> 11:48.880
And again that will be in meters per second.

11:48.880 --> 11:49.300
All right.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.470
I have everything here in S.I. units.

11:51.550 --> 11:55.690
So if that charge particle has this particular velocity here which is just a number here at the end

11:55.690 --> 12:00.490
of the day it's actually going to just make it to the other plate and then turn around and then come

12:00.490 --> 12:01.570
back.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.080
Let's go ahead and see how we can set this problem up.

12:04.090 --> 12:11.240
Now using conservation of energy right to solve this problem using conservation of energy let's consider

12:11.240 --> 12:16.970
that this bottom plate position is going to be my initial position and this top plate here is my final

12:16.970 --> 12:18.080
position.

12:18.080 --> 12:22.980
And what we have here is that the total energy at this point has to be equal to the total energy at

12:22.980 --> 12:24.680
my final position.

12:24.680 --> 12:29.990
So initially what we have is a lot of kinetic energy and we're going to be moving in a region where

12:29.990 --> 12:31.560
there's an electric field.

12:31.610 --> 12:34.980
Guess what we're also going to have some electrical potential energy.

12:35.030 --> 12:43.060
When I first enter this field region and as I move now toward the other plate and once my I reached

12:43.070 --> 12:49.850
the other side and if I just kind of turn around over here that means that my velocity or my speed is

12:49.850 --> 12:52.040
zero once I'm at the other plate.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.610
So my final kinetic energy over here at the top.

12:54.610 --> 12:59.470
K. final Allen's easy that has to be equal to zero.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.940
And that energy had to go somewhere.

13:01.940 --> 13:08.170
So actually it's going to be converted into electrical potential energy which I'm going to call you

13:08.170 --> 13:09.760
final.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.150
So the initial kinetic energy is really straightforward.

13:13.150 --> 13:19.450
I simply have a charge particle a proton it's moving so that guy always the same thing one half mass

13:19.450 --> 13:23.040
of that charge multiplied by that initial velocity.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.830
And let's just rewrite all of these other terms and you final.

13:26.860 --> 13:29.330
So there's no final kinetic energy for this problem.

13:29.350 --> 13:34.530
So all we really have to do is evaluate what is this potential energy over here.

13:34.600 --> 13:34.810
All right.

13:34.810 --> 13:40.990
Potential energy if you remember now from your class you probably saw that the potential energy of a

13:40.990 --> 13:47.290
charged particle in this case the charges Q or remember this little guy over here had a charge q and

13:47.290 --> 13:52.660
I'm placing it now in a region where there's an electric field the amount of energy that a charge has

13:52.660 --> 14:00.250
when it's in a region of electric field can be written as this it's the charge multiplied by the value

14:00.250 --> 14:01.940
of the electrical potential.

14:01.990 --> 14:02.350
Right.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.660
So this guy here is electrical potential

14:09.860 --> 14:15.770
This is the value of the charge and this is how much energy you have at least potential energy.

14:15.900 --> 14:19.220
So our goal now is what we need to calculate.

14:19.230 --> 14:21.020
What is this value.

14:21.090 --> 14:23.340
What is the value of V.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.940
When I am close to this plate.

14:24.960 --> 14:29.590
So what is the value of V initial over here and what is the value of V final.

14:29.610 --> 14:35.280
If I know that I can calculate both of these potential energy terms and then simply solve for that initial

14:35.280 --> 14:35.900
velocity.

14:36.630 --> 14:42.900
So carefully I am using an uppercase V to note the electrical potential versus the initial velocity

14:42.900 --> 14:45.380
here which is lowercase v zero.

14:45.480 --> 14:45.770
All right.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.690
So how do we relate that.

14:47.700 --> 14:50.380
And this is pretty simple for parallel plates.

14:50.400 --> 14:50.600
OK.

14:50.610 --> 14:57.210
So you're to write this down the expression that I'm writing down here is only valid for parallel plates.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.120
So don't try to use it for point charges.

14:59.130 --> 15:04.670
Don't try to use it for cylinders and for this case it's pretty simple it simply says that.

15:04.870 --> 15:09.040
Again remember how would we actually obtain the system we would plug it into a battery.

15:09.090 --> 15:09.660
Right.

15:09.870 --> 15:15.570
You'd plug it into a battery and the voltage difference between the battery I can write as V file minus

15:15.570 --> 15:16.860
V initial.

15:16.920 --> 15:24.140
This is the potential difference of that of the terminals of this battery that there simply equals two

15:24.150 --> 15:29.760
and I'm just writing it as the magnitude here as I call this Ed's formula because it's simply e the

15:29.760 --> 15:34.810
magnitude of the electric field multiplied by the distance between the plates.

15:34.830 --> 15:40.800
So in this case here if I have ten thousand a nuance per column and the distance between the plates

15:41.140 --> 15:45.080
I had previously said that the distance between the plates we call it D.

15:45.540 --> 15:52.310
And that was one centimeter so if I go ahead here and multiply this by convert it to meters which you

15:52.310 --> 15:57.140
end up getting here is one hundred volts.

15:57.370 --> 15:59.110
That's the difference of potential.

15:59.500 --> 16:04.300
So that might mean here that the difference has to be one hundred so he might have this one here at

16:04.300 --> 16:10.030
plus fifty volts and you might have this one here at negative fifty volts right so that would mean that

16:10.030 --> 16:16.810
the difference v final minus V initial over here 50 minus minus fifty would give me one hundred volts.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.980
So now let's go ahead and do that just substitute our values over here.

16:20.080 --> 16:25.900
Let's go back to the expression for conservation of energy and all we really want to do now is substitute

16:25.900 --> 16:28.820
our expressions for the electrical potential energy.

16:28.990 --> 16:33.700
So we have our kinetic energy one half and the initial squared.

16:33.700 --> 16:39.790
Now the initial potential energy as I enter the field region is the charge q multiplied by the value

16:39.790 --> 16:41.290
of that potential.

16:42.340 --> 16:48.520
And that there has to be equal to the final potential energy so it's the charge q minus V.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.510
Final.

16:50.530 --> 16:53.640
Now you have to do a little bit of algebra too because our goal was the final.

16:53.650 --> 16:57.390
How fast do I have to put this charge in the field region.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.380
So let's go ahead and do that.

16:59.830 --> 17:07.180
So I'm going to bring this term on the other side so this becomes Q This is v final minus V initial

17:07.680 --> 17:07.880
right.

17:07.900 --> 17:13.990
This is the difference of potential between both of those plates which we just said was 100 volts and

17:13.990 --> 17:18.690
all of this here has to be equal to my initial kinetic energy.

17:18.910 --> 17:23.040
And now again you do a little bit of algebra because my goal was to find v zero.

17:23.470 --> 17:26.280
So there's gonna be a square root term over here.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.210
S we're gonna have the square root.

17:29.210 --> 17:36.490
I bring the two over next door I get to Q The difference of potential which is call that delta v and

17:36.510 --> 17:39.330
again divided by the mass m.

17:39.390 --> 17:44.010
Now this expression might look a little bit different from the previous one because the previous one

17:44.010 --> 17:47.810
remember I had it in terms of the electric field and the distance D.

17:47.820 --> 17:51.130
However that's what this guy is right here.

17:51.210 --> 17:55.860
So if you go back and you substitute that you're gonna get the exact same expression as we previously

17:55.860 --> 18:00.390
had in that when I know the value you substitute all these values here you're going to get one point

18:00.390 --> 18:02.730
three eight times 10 to the five.

18:02.730 --> 18:08.370
And again that is going to be in meters per second I'm working in s units over here and that's it.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.610
That's how you would do this problem now using conservation of energy.

18:11.700 --> 18:17.160
I think the key is really just finding what this difference of voltages between the plates and you can

18:17.160 --> 18:17.610
do that.

18:17.610 --> 18:23.550
Using this Ed's formula what I call and again the key to remember here is that this formula here is

18:23.550 --> 18:31.650
only valid for parallel plates if you have different systems of charge for example charged cylinders

18:31.860 --> 18:35.520
the expression is going to look a little bit different than the simple expression.

18:35.520 --> 18:41.410
The reason it looks so simple for parallel plates is because the electric field is uniform here.

18:41.460 --> 18:46.200
So that means that the voltage varies linearly with distance between the plates.
