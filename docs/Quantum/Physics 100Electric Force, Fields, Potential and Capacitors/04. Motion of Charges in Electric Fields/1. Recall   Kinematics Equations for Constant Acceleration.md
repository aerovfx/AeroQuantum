# Recall   Kinematics Equations for Constant Acceleration

## 04. Motion of Charges in Electric Fields

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi what I want to do Bây giờ in this video is just to look at the emotion of charged particles between these các bản song song in order to do a lot of these problems you have to go back to kinetics. OK. In order to analyze the motion again I choose this example here. các bản song song versus the field produced by a point điện tích. Because Trong trường hợp này the the điện trường is uniform which means it's hằng số. OK. Let you write that down again. It's the same any position that you're looking at between these plates. And we just said earlier on that the gia tốc has to be the điện tích that I'm going to place between those plates the điện trường divided by the mass I super important phương trình over here. Được rồi. Vậy if the gia tốc is hằng số this means I can use some simple Keenum addicts to look at the to describe the motion of a charged particle between these plates. Let me show you an example. điều gì xảy ra nếu I place a small positive điện tích over here and it starts to accelerate. OK I may have a certain khoảng cách here between these plates. I don't know maybe we're going to call this khoảng cách d the spacing between the plates. What if I release it from rest. OK. I would have an initial tốc độ what if I wanted to know how long does it take before it gets to the other side. What if I wanted to know what is the tốc độ of this little điện tích when it gets to the other side. And imagine this here has a điện tích Q Được rồi. Another situation I could have is what if I take a negative điện tích and I give it some initial vận tốc v zero and I throw it up between the plates what happens to that điện tích. Đúng can I describe the motion of this charged particle this negative điện tích. Q Well as it enters the field it wants to go toward the positive plate. It wants to go away from the negative plate. Trong trường hợp này here if you do a free body diagram on this negative điện tích again I'll draw the các lực here in purple. Let me draw the lực the lực tác dụng lên this guy here has to be in this hướng and the lực is hằng số. It also means that the gia tốc is hằng số it's also given behind by phương trình up here. Vậy chúng ta có thể do some kinetics Bây giờ but you have to remember some of the equations for kinetics the kinetic equations are used only in the case where the gia tốc is hằng số. If you remember back in kind of the first physics class you took. If this was Earth we had another case where the gia tốc was hằng số. Được rồi. If I drop an apple over here we know that the gia tốc of the apple we wrote that as little g and this was nine point eight meters per second bình phương. That was the gia tốc and the earth is kind of like a big plate. Được if you're close to the plate the gia tốc is hằng số kind of the same thing is this parallel plate. Vậy if the gia tốc was hằng số there were a whole set of equations that you can use to analyze the motion. Let me write them down. I call them the big five equations. Again they're just kind of good to remember if you don't remember we'll write them down. Vậy chúng ta có four and five for the green điện tích over here. Trong trường hợp này it's in two dimensions Vậy you'll really have to look at them in the x and the y hướng separately. I'm just gonna write down the general equations see if you remember this one here said that the độ dời in a hướng is equal to one half the initial vận tốc plus the vận tốc times time. This one over here is the final vận tốc V.F. is equal to the initial vận tốc plus the gia tốc times time. This one over here is also used quite a bit. The độ dời equals to the initial vận tốc times time plus one half. 80 bình phương is another one here which is kind of similar except it uses the final vận tốc. This one's probably not as popular but it had just has a different sign but it also has the different vận tốc Đúng here and another one that's used quite a bit is this one the final vận tốc bình phương equals to the initial vận tốc bình phương plus two times the gia tốc multiplied by the độ dời for this green one over here. Again if there's only gia tốc in one hướng again you'd have to xem xét that Đúng. We'll have to write them in the x and the y hướng separately in order to analyze the motion. This guy over here looks very very similar to projectile motion Đúng for projectile motion if you remember what you have is you have something like this and what I do is either kick a ball at a certain angle and that ball ends up doing a projectile motion and I can tính toán how far it goes I can tính toán the maximum height and Vậy forth. Trong trường hợp này here what the projectile is going to do or the điện tích is Trong trường hợp này it's just going to get deflected. There's a lực tác dụng lên it. Vậy the motion is going to get deflected. Vậy it would usually kind of pop out on the other side of the plates with some độ dời over here in this hướng. Again depending on the size of the điện trường or the size of this điện tích it might not even make it across the plates Đúng. It might just kind of boom hit the plate Đúng here. It might just hit the plate Đúng here. If there is a large lực tác dụng lên it. Được but going forward you might have to use some of these Cannon Matic equations in order to analyze the motion of các điện tích and we're able to use these here only because chúng ta có a hằng số gia tốc. Vậy instead of using nine point eight over here for the gia tốc instead of doing that well we're going to do is we're going to use our value that we're going to tính toán inside these equations. This is going to be the gia tốc. Vậy we're gonna get a number if you know the điện tích the field and the mass of the particle that's entering this field and then you plug that number in. It's a hằng số number just put it in there.
