00:00.390 --> 00:00.680
All right.

00:00.690 --> 00:06.990
So here we have a question once have a look at it says a pair of charge conducted plates produce a uniform

00:06.990 --> 00:10.480
field of 12000 newtons per cool.

00:10.770 --> 00:12.090
It's directed to the right.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.180
OK so this is what we have over here.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.100
The separation between the plates is 40 millimeters.

00:17.100 --> 00:23.700
And we have an electron here is projected from plate a toward plate B.

00:23.780 --> 00:28.290
And in this case we're also given some initial velocity of this value.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.490
Kind of a big value right.

00:29.940 --> 00:32.460
What is the speed as it strikes the other plate.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.270
Okay.

00:33.310 --> 00:36.150
And we've given you some data here for the electron.

00:36.270 --> 00:36.520
OK.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.490
So let's have a look at what's going on over here.

00:38.550 --> 00:41.990
If we just draw that electron we just draw it over here.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.670
So it has a charge of negative e and it has a mass given over here.

00:47.670 --> 00:53.670
Now if the electric field points in this direction over here what's going to happen well imagine we

00:53.670 --> 00:59.360
are going to draw the charges on the plates first of all if the electric field is pointing like this.

00:59.370 --> 01:02.750
That means that this here is positive.

01:03.000 --> 01:03.500
And what else.

01:03.510 --> 01:07.840
This played here would be negatively charged.

01:07.890 --> 01:08.090
All right.

01:08.090 --> 01:09.480
And what happens to this electron.

01:09.480 --> 01:12.150
Well initially it has a big velocity right.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.620
It's given a velocity v zero.

01:15.630 --> 01:19.310
The question is how fast is it moving when it strikes over here.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.910
So what is the force acting on the electron.

01:22.410 --> 01:26.520
As the electron moves I'm actually going to get rid of this for now because I really just want to do

01:26.520 --> 01:28.990
a free body diagram over here.

01:29.010 --> 01:35.490
So the force on this electron well again is being attracted by the positive it's being repelled by these.

01:36.510 --> 01:41.580
So that means that the force on the electron has to be in this direction and that's it.

01:41.580 --> 01:43.020
That's the only force acting on it.

01:43.650 --> 01:47.510
So noon second law says you add up all the forces.

01:47.510 --> 01:52.650
There's only one and that should be equal to the charge of the electron the magnitude multiplied by

01:52.650 --> 01:55.220
the magnitude of the electric field.

01:55.220 --> 01:58.950
And this here has to be equal to mass times the acceleration.

01:58.950 --> 01:59.180
OK.

01:59.190 --> 02:03.240
So our acceleration for our electron is E.

02:03.430 --> 02:04.160
The charge.

02:04.200 --> 02:08.130
The magnitude of the field and divided by the mass of this electron.

02:08.130 --> 02:14.210
I know all the numbers here so in principle I could get a value for the acceleration of the electron.

02:14.220 --> 02:17.670
Now I'm just going to make a note here saying that it is slowing down

02:20.510 --> 02:24.980
so if the acceleration was big enough it might actually not even reach this plate.

02:24.990 --> 02:27.680
So here I guess they're assuming that it does strike the other plate.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.470
So let's go ahead and use one of our key nomadic equations.

02:31.580 --> 02:38.690
If we're looking for the final speed and we know the distance one of them is this equation here that

02:38.690 --> 02:45.860
the velocity squared equals to the initial velocity squared plus two times the acceleration and the

02:45.890 --> 02:46.950
displacement.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.490
Delta X.

02:48.610 --> 02:53.230
Now in this case again the acceleration and the displacement are in different directions.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.210
So one of these is going to have to be negative.

02:55.220 --> 02:55.570
Right.

02:55.580 --> 03:01.370
We're gonna take our coordinate system so that everything that's pointing this way is a positive value.

03:02.300 --> 03:02.520
Okay.

03:02.540 --> 03:07.070
So let's go ahead and substitute in our thing and at the end what we want is just the final velocity

03:07.070 --> 03:09.770
so all we have to do is take the square root of everything here.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.240
So let's substitute our values.

03:11.270 --> 03:17.590
So we have our initial velocity which is right here two point zero times 10 to the seven.

03:17.590 --> 03:21.320
You have to square that value plus two times.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.730
Now again it's going to slow down.

03:22.730 --> 03:27.200
So really at the end this term is going to end up being negative and that's because the acceleration

03:27.200 --> 03:29.260
is pointing in a different direction.

03:29.280 --> 03:29.450
Right.

03:29.450 --> 03:34.070
The acceleration is pointing to the left but our displacement is to the right.

03:34.610 --> 03:39.080
So the acceleration here should be minus E E.

03:39.170 --> 03:39.950
Actually that's good.

03:39.950 --> 03:41.830
Go ahead and substitute the numbers.

03:41.870 --> 03:50.160
So you should get minus one point six times ten to the negative 19 the electric field is twelve thousand

03:51.470 --> 03:58.820
and all of this divided by the mass of the electron which is nine point one one times 10 to the negative

03:58.820 --> 03:59.480
31.

04:00.070 --> 04:00.370
OK.

04:00.380 --> 04:07.280
That is my acceleration and then multiplied by the displacement in this case it's 40 millimeters.

04:07.370 --> 04:11.100
This is 40 times ten to the negative three.

04:11.190 --> 04:12.280
OK.

04:12.470 --> 04:13.700
Extend that square root.

04:13.700 --> 04:18.500
There is a whole bunch of terms in here but at the end all we have to do is substitute in all our numbers

04:18.920 --> 04:21.770
and just be a little bit careful when you evaluate this.

04:21.810 --> 04:22.610
OK.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.180
At the end I think we should get that the answer again.

04:25.270 --> 04:26.930
It's got to be slower right.

04:26.930 --> 04:31.490
So actually I could have right away it really eliminated those ones because it will slow down and then

04:31.490 --> 04:33.140
we're left with three choices.

04:33.140 --> 04:38.780
Put that in your calculator I think you should get choice B which is one point five times 10 to the

04:38.780 --> 04:41.780
seven meters per second.

04:41.810 --> 04:42.320
OK.

04:43.950 --> 04:49.340
Here's problem two says electron is projected in this case it's going up over here with an initial velocity

04:49.340 --> 04:56.730
of eight point seven times 10 to the 7 along the vertical y axis.

04:56.840 --> 04:57.140
OK.

04:57.140 --> 05:03.200
And that's kind of in between this plate here that has a separation of 10 centimeters or point one metres.

05:03.200 --> 05:03.560
All right.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.920
Now we have a uniform electric field in the x direction.

05:06.980 --> 05:07.220
Okay.

05:07.220 --> 05:09.910
So that's kind of shown over here.

05:10.460 --> 05:13.610
If the magnitude of the acceleration is measured.

05:13.710 --> 05:14.050
Okay.

05:14.050 --> 05:17.750
This is measured what is the magnitude of the electric field between the plates.

05:18.300 --> 05:18.630
Okay.

05:18.660 --> 05:23.600
Well again this one is pretty straightforward I think.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.820
Right.

05:24.920 --> 05:30.230
Again if we go back to our free body diagram again this electron here again the plates here are going

05:30.230 --> 05:33.740
to be charge if you think about it should be charged like this again.

05:35.020 --> 05:35.530
OK.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.700
And negative on this side.

05:37.730 --> 05:40.130
Now this problem gives you a lot of additional information.

05:40.130 --> 05:46.070
However there is only one force acting on that electron and that force is given by the charge multiplied

05:46.070 --> 05:47.360
by the field.

05:47.900 --> 05:52.010
And that has to be equal to the mass times the acceleration.

05:52.010 --> 05:52.190
All right.

05:52.190 --> 05:53.780
Do we know the mass of the electron.

05:53.780 --> 05:54.570
Yes we do.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.120
OK.

05:55.130 --> 05:55.590
What else.

05:55.610 --> 05:59.480
We know the acceleration that's given in the problem and we know the charge.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.590
So all we're asking for is the magnitude of the electric field.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.060
That's this guy right here.

06:04.070 --> 06:06.140
So let's just get an expression for it.

06:06.200 --> 06:10.430
So it's a mass acceleration and divided by the charge.

06:10.550 --> 06:15.050
Again we don't have to worry about the negative side that only tells us the direction but we know automatically

06:15.050 --> 06:18.350
that the electron wants to go toward the positive plate.

06:19.040 --> 06:26.480
So here we just substitute in all our numbers the masses nine point 1 1 times 10 to the negative 31

06:27.230 --> 06:31.000
multiplied by the acceleration that was given in the problem right here.

06:31.310 --> 06:35.990
Eight point nine multiplied by 10 to 15.

06:35.990 --> 06:36.510
OK.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.640
And the last one is divided by the charge.

06:39.650 --> 06:44.690
That's our one point six times ten to the negative 19.

06:44.720 --> 06:44.960
All right.

06:44.960 --> 06:48.050
We have to substitute in all the values over here.

06:48.050 --> 06:51.750
And I think you should get 50 1000 roughly.

06:52.740 --> 06:53.780
Newton's preschool on.

06:54.320 --> 07:00.290
So in that case the correct answer should be choice a Here's problem three.

07:00.290 --> 07:07.290
It asks for the magnitude of the electric field that will balance a plastic weight that has a massive

07:07.310 --> 07:09.040
two point one grams.

07:09.070 --> 07:09.280
All right.

07:09.290 --> 07:10.570
So here's our plastic weight.

07:10.580 --> 07:14.000
And we're going to have a weight which is acting down.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.370
That's equal to M.G. and that better be balanced by an electric force.

07:19.370 --> 07:25.580
The electric force should be acting opposite and that there has a magnitude equal to 0 the charge saw

07:25.580 --> 07:27.980
the charges Q In this case.

07:27.980 --> 07:33.640
This case is a negative three nano coolant multiplied by the field.

07:33.890 --> 07:34.300
Okay.

07:34.310 --> 07:34.820
And that's it.

07:34.820 --> 07:40.350
So the electric field if you were really to think about it the electric field should be in this direction.

07:40.370 --> 07:45.070
We're only asking for the magnitude however and the electric feels in this direction because the force

07:45.070 --> 07:48.720
is opposite because we have a negative charge.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.120
Okay.

07:49.150 --> 07:57.920
So we want to balance everything out here so we have QE equals 2 M G E bring the Q on the bottom over

07:57.920 --> 08:01.550
here M.G. divided by Q All right.

08:01.550 --> 08:08.420
Now all we have to do is just substitute in all the values the mass is two point one grams that's two

08:08.420 --> 08:17.090
point one multiplied by ten to the negative three multiplied by a little G that's nine point eight and

08:17.090 --> 08:23.850
divided by the charge charge in this case just the magnitude three times tend to the negative nine cool

08:23.850 --> 08:30.500
ohms All right at the end of the day I think you should get a choice a which is six point nine times

08:30.500 --> 08:37.630
10 to the 6:00 news per call on all right that's it for that one.

08:37.670 --> 08:45.280
Let's go to next one last problem over here says that a proton is placed in an electric field with a

08:45.280 --> 08:51.280
magnitude of eight hundred newtons per column what are the magnitude and direction of the acceleration.

08:51.310 --> 08:51.580
Okay.

08:51.610 --> 08:55.540
So here is a proton we know it has a charge of positive

08:58.130 --> 09:02.900
so imagine now it's placed in a field which is just like this.

09:02.930 --> 09:08.100
This is the electric field and the magnitude is eight hundred.

09:08.710 --> 09:09.020
All right.

09:09.020 --> 09:13.820
How would you draw a force on that positive Proton.

09:14.120 --> 09:18.550
Again the force is given by QE and since the charge is positive.

09:18.740 --> 09:25.760
Our electric force F has to be simply e multiplied by E and they're in the same direction because our

09:25.760 --> 09:26.900
charge is positive.

09:27.370 --> 09:28.190
OK.

09:28.280 --> 09:32.860
So all we want to do now is just to determine the acceleration.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.540
So if this is the only force acting on it.

09:35.690 --> 09:43.080
Newton's second law says you add up all the forces and that has to be equal to mass times acceleration.

09:43.130 --> 09:50.560
And again this guy here is simply the charge multiplied by the field has the equal mass times acceleration.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.010
All right.

09:51.020 --> 10:00.920
So this leads to one final expression for acceleration is the charge the field and divided by the mass.

10:00.920 --> 10:03.140
All right let me give myself a little bit more space over here.

10:03.140 --> 10:09.700
So the acceleration is the charge one point six times 10 to the negative 19.

10:10.130 --> 10:13.150
Our field here has a magnitude of eight hundred.

10:14.390 --> 10:15.820
And again the mass.

10:15.830 --> 10:23.550
Now the mass of the proton is given its one point six seven multiplied by ten to the negative twenty

10:23.550 --> 10:25.150
seven.

10:25.730 --> 10:28.280
So you've got to put all that in your calculator.

10:28.460 --> 10:33.980
And at the end I think you should get something that's going to be looking like this six point sorry

10:33.980 --> 10:43.780
seven point six six multiplied by ten to the ten that's in meters per second squared.

10:43.970 --> 10:46.660
Now so let's look at all these choices.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.430
First of all this one here is the wrong magnitude.

10:49.430 --> 10:55.060
Now what about the direction the direction we said has to be in the same direction of the electric field.

10:55.070 --> 10:56.140
So can't be opposite.

10:56.150 --> 10:56.290
Right.

10:56.300 --> 11:02.000
Any choice with opposite here that can't be true opposite D also has opposite.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.830
And this one here has a different magnitude actually so C is really the correct answer.

11:06.860 --> 11:12.590
It has the direction that's in the direction of the electric field and the magnitude is also correct.

11:12.590 --> 11:12.830
All right.

11:12.830 --> 11:13.670
Good job.

11:13.670 --> 11:14.750
Hopefully you got all those.
