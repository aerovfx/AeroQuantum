00:00.990 --> 00:06.450
Today I want to look at the motion of a charged particle traveling between parallel plates.

00:06.450 --> 00:10.200
So I've illustrated the problem over here on the board.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.280
So we've got two plates.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.870
One is positively charged with a charge density plus sigma.

00:14.940 --> 00:19.410
The other one is negatively charged with a the opposite charge on it.

00:19.410 --> 00:29.130
We have a small particle with a charge q moving into the region where the there's a constant field and

00:29.130 --> 00:31.450
the initial velocity is v zero.

00:31.540 --> 00:36.570
And what I want to do now is I want to look at the motion of this charge particle when it's traveling

00:36.570 --> 00:39.510
between the parallel plates.

00:39.630 --> 00:42.300
So let's look at a couple simple cases.

00:42.300 --> 00:45.180
The first is what if there is no charge on the plates.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.250
There's no charge on the plates.

00:47.250 --> 00:53.460
The particle is simply going to continue along the dotted line and will not be deflected.

00:53.670 --> 00:58.950
It continues along the dotted line because there's simply no force acting on the charge.

00:59.100 --> 01:02.880
Then the other case we can do is what if there's a lot of charge.

01:03.150 --> 01:09.930
If there's a lot of charge on the plates one thing you should know is that the field between the plates

01:10.560 --> 01:13.970
goes from the positive to the negative.

01:14.370 --> 01:21.520
And if we neglect things going on at the edges the field between the plates is uniform.

01:21.720 --> 01:29.850
The magnitude of the field is simply equal to Sigma divided by epsilon 0.

01:30.230 --> 01:31.270
Okay let's have a look.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.430
Now when the field is very very strong what's gonna happen.

01:34.430 --> 01:40.250
While this charge is going to enter the field region and as soon as it enters the field region there's

01:40.250 --> 01:47.330
gonna be a force acting on the charge of the force acting on the charge against since it's a positive

01:47.330 --> 01:52.820
charge a positive charge in a field that points from the top plate to the bottom plate.

01:53.060 --> 01:56.900
As soon as it enters the field region there's a force acting on it.

01:57.430 --> 02:04.670
There's an electric force F acting on it and the value of the force is simply the magnitude of the charge.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.620
Times the electric field in that region.

02:08.390 --> 02:10.990
So this is kind of a special case right.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.050
If the field is very very big in the field will be very big.

02:14.060 --> 02:16.090
If you have a lot of charge on it.

02:16.340 --> 02:21.440
If I have a very large charge density the field produced between the plates is going to be very very

02:21.440 --> 02:22.370
big.

02:22.370 --> 02:26.180
Well what's gonna happen now is the charge is going to enter this region and there is going to be a

02:26.180 --> 02:27.400
large force on it.

02:27.690 --> 02:32.930
Right there is a repulsive force from the positive plate acting on the positive charge and there is

02:32.930 --> 02:39.950
an attractive force on the positive charge going through this region.

02:39.950 --> 02:42.760
So if the field is very very big this is what it's going to do.

02:42.800 --> 02:47.300
It's simply going to curve downward and eventually hit that negative plate.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.070
What we don't want that to happen.

02:49.130 --> 02:50.010
OK.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.720
The question is what is the maximum charge.

02:53.720 --> 03:01.280
BIG Q that I can put on the plates so that I have the maximum deflection of that positive charge.

03:01.280 --> 03:06.290
So if you think about it if I put just the right amount of charge on these plates I'm going to generate

03:06.350 --> 03:11.450
just the right electric field such that the charged particle as soon as it enters the region starts

03:11.450 --> 03:12.850
getting deflected.

03:13.280 --> 03:19.550
And if it's just right I'm gonna get this maximum deflection and the little charge q is going to exit

03:19.850 --> 03:23.180
the field region at some particular angle.

03:23.180 --> 03:27.920
It's not going to hit the plate and it's not gonna go straight it's just going to be the maximum deflection

03:27.920 --> 03:33.680
that you can have for that particular charge so let's go to the whiteboard and see how we can calculate

03:34.460 --> 03:42.470
what value of uppercase Q I need to put on the plates in order to have this maximum deflection for this

03:42.740 --> 03:45.620
small charge moving through that region.

03:46.240 --> 03:46.620
All right.

03:46.640 --> 03:51.410
So here's our problem we have our charge moving into the region where the field is the first thing you

03:51.410 --> 03:53.890
should do is consider free body diagram.

03:53.980 --> 03:57.290
We want to analyze the motion so let's look at the forces again.

03:57.410 --> 03:59.300
There's only a single force acting on it.

03:59.330 --> 04:05.030
That's the electric force and the magnitude of the force is simply Q times the magnitude of the electric

04:05.030 --> 04:06.180
field.

04:06.890 --> 04:10.090
Since there's only one force noone second losses you add up all the forces.

04:10.090 --> 04:11.580
Those should be equal to many.

04:12.260 --> 04:20.060
So the nice thing is now we have an expression for our acceleration and we simply have QE divided by

04:20.060 --> 04:24.630
the mass of the particle All right.

04:24.630 --> 04:25.740
The nice thing about this.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.630
This is a constant acceleration

04:31.450 --> 04:35.570
and that means the rotation.

04:35.860 --> 04:36.700
That means now.

04:36.700 --> 04:42.700
Now we can use all our key nomadic equations in order to analyze the motion of this charged particle

04:43.330 --> 04:45.010
between the plates.

04:45.010 --> 04:47.740
So let's go to the next page and see how he would do that.

04:48.730 --> 04:52.710
OK so now let's look at the Kitimat X in the x direction.

04:52.880 --> 04:57.230
Well in the end the record in the x direction we want to look at the displacement in the x direction.

04:57.300 --> 05:03.040
Call that delta x and that's simply going to be equal to the initial velocity in the x direction which

05:03.040 --> 05:10.780
is v not times the time the other quantity we want to know during the trajectory is the velocity in

05:10.780 --> 05:12.880
the x direction at any time.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.630
And that's simply going to be equal to the initial velocity.

05:15.730 --> 05:21.160
There's no acceleration the x direction this problem because the electric field is constant the electric

05:21.160 --> 05:22.260
force is constant.

05:22.300 --> 05:24.280
So that's it.

05:24.280 --> 05:32.590
Let's look at now in the y direction our displacement Y is going to be equal to where we have our initial

05:32.590 --> 05:34.660
velocity in the y direction.

05:34.660 --> 05:37.350
There is no initial velocity in the y direction.

05:37.620 --> 05:43.810
OK so that term vanishes so typically you'd have a term like this.

05:44.350 --> 05:48.490
And if we define a coordinate system where positive X is this way.

05:48.840 --> 05:51.370
And let's make positive y in this direction.

05:51.370 --> 05:53.750
So our acceleration will be positive.

05:53.830 --> 05:58.390
We have another contribution here which is 1 1/2 80 squared.

05:59.770 --> 06:06.280
However this term as I mentioned equals the zero because there is no initial velocity initially I'm

06:06.280 --> 06:09.080
just going along the x axis.

06:09.130 --> 06:16.300
The other thing I want to know is what is the velocity at any motion at any point in time in the y direction.

06:16.300 --> 06:23.590
Again it's the initial velocity in the y direction which is zero and we can't forget our acceleration

06:23.590 --> 06:27.550
term plus acceleration times time.

06:28.810 --> 06:29.130
Okay.

06:29.140 --> 06:29.890
There you have it folks.

06:29.890 --> 06:39.490
So we have kinetic equations that tell us the X displacement the Y displacement and the velocity components

06:39.490 --> 06:41.620
at any instant in time.

06:41.650 --> 06:46.520
So now we can go back and analyze the problem and find what we're looking for.

06:46.540 --> 06:54.400
So this problem is exactly identical to throwing an object horizontally from a cliff and you want to

06:54.400 --> 06:56.150
see how far it goes.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.360
We want the range in this particular problem.

06:58.360 --> 07:04.840
So the distance it travels to be the distance of the plates or the length of the plates which is L and

07:04.840 --> 07:12.520
we're gonna want to set our y displacement to be the maximum value when the Y displacement is equal

07:12.520 --> 07:15.240
to D over 2.

07:15.700 --> 07:20.940
We're gonna get the maximum deflection of this charged particle when it goes through the plates.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.980
So let's go to the next page and set that problem up.

07:26.960 --> 07:33.170
OK so we want our maximum deflection where we want to calculate what the maximum deflection is going

07:33.170 --> 07:34.550
to be.

07:34.550 --> 07:42.200
Well all we really need to do is we really need to set the wide displacement equal to half the distance

07:42.200 --> 07:45.360
between the plates because I'm starting already at the midpoint.

07:45.530 --> 07:52.070
So I really want my wide displacement to be d over 2 and positive D over 2 because the displacement

07:52.070 --> 07:55.820
is down that there is going to be equal to one half.

07:55.820 --> 08:05.990
What is my acceleration the acceleration I can write it in terms of the field QE over him over the multiply

08:06.020 --> 08:08.660
times T squared.

08:08.660 --> 08:15.350
Therefore I still have the the time in this equation so I need to find a way to eliminate the time in

08:15.350 --> 08:21.680
order to do that I can use my X displacement because really when I want to do is I want this maximum

08:21.680 --> 08:28.340
displacement to be when the particle is just exiting the plates and that's gonna be when my displacement

08:28.340 --> 08:31.140
in the x direction is equal to l.

08:31.400 --> 08:36.910
When do I have that I'm gonna have the displacement is gonna be equal to the length of the plates.

08:37.160 --> 08:42.800
When the time is simply l divided by my initial velocity.

08:43.640 --> 08:50.780
So if you go ahead and substitute that into our equation over here for the Y displacement we get D over

08:50.780 --> 09:01.780
to equals to one half QE and we're gonna have l over V not squared.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.520
So this here is the maximum displacement

09:08.960 --> 09:15.930
and this here is really gonna be the maximum electric field that's going to give me that displacement.

09:17.050 --> 09:23.440
I can actually just isolate for that and what do I get while the 1 1/2 terms cancel out.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.360
Just do a little bit of algebra and simplify.

09:27.380 --> 09:33.740
So the maximum electric field that I'm gonna get that will produce the maximum displacement is going

09:33.740 --> 09:36.960
to be M D.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.380
Sure I do things correctly here divide through by the charge and then I have to eliminate this term

09:42.380 --> 09:50.050
the L over V not term I bring that over to the other side it becomes V not over l it's still squared.

09:50.270 --> 09:54.570
So here's the maximum value of the electric field.

09:54.620 --> 10:00.140
Now the question was posed a little bit differently I asked what's the maximum charge on the plate.

10:00.360 --> 10:06.320
That's very easy because we're looking at parallel plates and the field produced by parallel plates

10:06.320 --> 10:15.380
at least in the region between the plates is Sigma divided by epsilon 0 and the sigma is simply the

10:15.380 --> 10:22.850
surface charge density it's the amount of charge you have per unit area of plate and we still have the

10:22.850 --> 10:31.400
Epsilon 0 constant so the maximum electric field is going to be for any given geometry.

10:31.400 --> 10:36.640
Whenever I maximize the charge density or maximize the charge on the plates.

10:36.860 --> 10:43.490
So our last step putting everything together now make a bit more room here.

10:47.890 --> 10:50.400
Okay so we're gonna have q Max

10:55.600 --> 11:00.340
is going to be equal to the area.

11:01.540 --> 11:03.190
Epsilon 0.

11:03.670 --> 11:15.020
Mass times distance of the plates divided by Q and V not over L squared all right.

11:15.150 --> 11:20.940
So there's the final answer expressed in terms of the geometry of the plate the area and the distance

11:21.360 --> 11:26.660
and in terms and the length and also in terms of some of the properties of the charge.

11:26.670 --> 11:34.580
So the small charge q the mass of the charge M and also the initial velocity v 0.

11:34.630 --> 11:40.110
Okay so this makes a lot of sense actually if the particles going very very fast in order to get it

11:40.110 --> 11:47.670
to have a maximum displacement here when I'm between the charges or between the plates rather it's going

11:47.670 --> 11:49.120
very very fast.

11:49.230 --> 11:55.050
You'd expect that you would need more charge on the plates in order to achieve this deflection in a

11:55.050 --> 11:57.430
fixed length.

11:58.620 --> 11:59.700
There you have it folks.
