# Finding the Maximum Deflection of a Charge

## 04. Motion of Charges in Electric Fields

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Today I want to look at the motion of a charged particle traveling between các bản song song. Vậy I've illustrated the problem over here on the board. Vậy we've got two plates. One is positively charged with a điện tích density plus sigma. The other one is negatively charged with a the opposite điện tích on it. chúng ta có a small particle with a điện tích q moving into the region where the there's a hằng số field and the initial vận tốc is v zero. And what I want to do Bây giờ is I want to look at the motion of this điện tích particle when it's traveling between the các bản song song. Vậy let's look at a couple simple cases. The first is what if there is Không điện tích on the plates. There's Không điện tích on the plates. The particle is simply going to continue along the dotted line and will not be deflected. It continues along the dotted line because there's simply Không lực tác dụng lên the điện tích. Then the other case chúng ta có thể do is what if there's a lot of điện tích. If there's a lot of điện tích on the plates one thing you should know is that the field between the plates goes from the positive to the negative. And if we neglect things going on at the edges the field between the plates is uniform. The độ lớn of the field is simply equal to Sigma divided by epsilon 0. Được let's have a look. Bây giờ when the field is very very strong what's gonna happen. While this điện tích is going to enter the field region and as soon as it enters the field region there's gonna be a lực tác dụng lên the điện tích of the lực tác dụng lên the điện tích against since it's a positive điện tích a positive điện tích in a field that points from the top plate to the bottom plate. As soon as it enters the field region there's a lực tác dụng lên it. There's an lực điện F tác dụng lên it and the value of the lực is simply the độ lớn of the điện tích. Times the điện trường in that region. Vậy this is kind of a special case Đúng. If the field is very very big in the field will be very big. If you have a lot of điện tích on it. If I have a very large điện tích density the field produced between the plates is going to be very very big. Well what's gonna happen Bây giờ is the điện tích is going to enter this region and there is going to be a large lực on it. Đúng there is a repulsive lực from the positive plate tác dụng lên the positive điện tích and there is an attractive lực on the positive điện tích going through this region. Vậy if the field is very very big this is what it's going to do. It's simply going to curve downward and eventually hit that negative plate. What we don't want that to happen. OK. The question is what is the maximum điện tích. BIG Q that I can put on the plates Vậy that I have the maximum deflection of that positive điện tích. Vậy if you think about it if I put just the Đúng amount of điện tích on these plates I'm going to generate just the Đúng điện trường such that the charged particle as soon as it enters the region starts getting deflected. And if it's just Đúng I'm gonna get this maximum deflection and the little điện tích q is going to exit the field region at some particular angle. It's not going to hit the plate and it's not gonna go straight it's just going to be the maximum deflection that you can have for that particular điện tích Vậy let's go to the whiteboard and see how chúng ta có thể tính toán what value of uppercase Q I need to put on the plates in order to have this maximum deflection for this small điện tích moving through that region. Được rồi. Vậy here's our problem chúng ta có our điện tích moving into the region where the field is the first thing you should do is xem xét free body diagram. We want to analyze the motion Vậy let's look at the các lực again. There's only a single lực tác dụng lên it. That's the lực điện and the độ lớn of the lực is simply Q times the độ lớn of the điện trường. Since there's only one lực noone second losses you add up all the các lực. Those should be equal to many. Vậy the nice thing is Bây giờ chúng ta có an expression for our gia tốc and we simply have QE divided by the mass of the particle Được rồi. The nice thing about this. This is a hằng số gia tốc and điều đó có nghĩa là the rotation. điều đó có nghĩa là Bây giờ. Bây giờ chúng ta có thể use all our key nomadic equations in order to analyze the motion of this charged particle between the plates. Vậy let's go to the next page and see how he would do that. OK Vậy Bây giờ let's look at the Kitimat X in the x hướng. Well in the end the record in the x hướng we want to look at the độ dời in the x hướng. Call that delta x and that's simply going to be equal to the initial vận tốc in the x hướng which is v not times the time the other quantity we want to know during the trajectory is the vận tốc in the x hướng at any time. And that's simply going to be equal to the initial vận tốc. There's Không gia tốc the x hướng this problem because the điện trường is hằng số the lực điện is hằng số. Vậy that's it. Let's look at Bây giờ in the y hướng our độ dời Y is going to be equal to where chúng ta có our initial vận tốc in the y hướng. There is Không initial vận tốc in the y hướng. OK Vậy that term vanishes Vậy typically you'd have a term like this. And if we định nghĩa a coordinate system where positive X is this way. And let's make positive y in this hướng. Vậy our gia tốc will be positive. chúng ta có another contribution here which is 1 1/2 80 bình phương. However this term as I mentioned equals the zero because there is Không initial vận tốc initially I'm just going along the x axis. The other thing I want to know is what is the vận tốc at any motion at any point in time in the y hướng. Again it's the initial vận tốc in the y hướng which is zero and chúng ta có thể't forget our gia tốc term plus gia tốc times time. Được. There you have it folks. Vậy chúng ta có kinetic equations that tell us the X độ dời the Y độ dời and the vận tốc components at any instant in time. Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có thể go back and analyze the problem and find what we're looking for. Vậy this problem is exactly identical to throwing an object horizontally from a cliff and you want to see how far it goes. We want the range in this particular problem. Vậy the khoảng cách it travels to be the khoảng cách of the plates or the length of the plates which is L and we're gonna want to set our y độ dời to be the maximum value when the Y độ dời is equal to D ove$r^2$. We're gonna get the maximum deflection of this charged particle when it goes through the plates. Vậy let's go to the next page and set that problem up. OK Vậy we want our maximum deflection where we want to tính toán what the maximum deflection is going to be. Well all we really need to do is we really need to set the wide độ dời equal to half the khoảng cách between the plates because I'm starting already at the midpoint. Vậy I really want my wide độ dời to be d ove$r^2$ and positive D ove$r^2$ because the độ dời is down that there is going to be equal to one half. What is my gia tốc the gia tốc I can write it in terms of the field QE over him over the multiply times T bình phương. Therefore I still have the the time in this phương trình Vậy I need to find a way to eliminate the time in order to do that I can use my X độ dời because really when I want to do is I want this maximum độ dời to be when the particle is just exiting the plates and that's gonna be when my độ dời in the x hướng is equal to l. When do I have that I'm gonna have the độ dời is gonna be equal to the length of the plates. When the time is simply l divided by my initial vận tốc. Vậy if you go ahead and substitute that into our phương trình over here for the Y độ dời we get D over to equals to one half QE and we're gonna have l over V not bình phương. Vậy this here is the maximum độ dời and this here is really gonna be the maximum điện trường that's going to give me that độ dời. I can actually just isolate for that and what do I get while the 1 1/2 terms cancel out. Just do a little bit of algebra and simplify. Vậy the maximum điện trường that I'm gonna get that will tạo ra the maximum độ dời is going to be M D. Sure I do things correctly here divide through by the điện tích and then I have to eliminate this term the L over V not term I bring that over to the other side it becomes V not over l it's still bình phương. Vậy here's the maximum value of the điện trường. Bây giờ the question was posed a little bit differently I asked what's the maximum điện tích on the plate. That's very easy because we're looking at các bản song song and the field produced by các bản song song at least in the region between the plates is Sigma divided by epsilon 0 and the sigma is simply the mặt điện tích density it's the amount of điện tích you have per unit area of plate and we still have the Epsilon 0 hằng số Vậy the maximum điện trường is going to be for any given geometry. Whenever I maximize the điện tích density or maximize the điện tích on the plates. Vậy our last step putting everything together Bây giờ make a bit more room here. Được Vậy we're gonna have q Max is going to be equal to the area. Epsilon 0. Mass times khoảng cách of the plates divided by Q and V not over L bình phương Được rồi. Vậy there's the final answer expressed in terms of the geometry of the plate the area and the khoảng cách and in terms and the length and also in terms of some of the properties of the điện tích. Vậy the small điện tích q the mass of the điện tích M and also the initial vận tốc v 0. Được Vậy this makes a lot of sense actually if the particles going very very fast in order to get it to have a maximum độ dời here when I'm between the các điện tích or between the plates rather it's going very very fast. You'd expect that you would need more điện tích on the plates in order to achieve this deflection in a fixed length. There you have it folks.
