### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy here chúng ta có a question once have a look at it says a pair of điện tích conducted plates tạo ra a uniform field of 12000 newtons per cool. It's directed to the Đúng. OK Vậy this is what chúng ta có over here. The separation between the plates is 40 millimeters. And chúng ta có an electron here is projected from plate a toward plate B. And Trong trường hợp này we're also given some initial vận tốc of this value. Kind of a big value Đúng. What is the tốc độ as it strikes the other plate. Được. And we've given you some data here for the electron. OK. Vậy let's have a look at what's going on over here. If we just draw that electron we just draw it over here. Vậy it has a điện tích of negative e and it has a mass given over here. Bây giờ if the điện trường points in this hướng over here what's going to happen well imagine we are going to draw the các điện tích on the plates first of all if the điện trường is pointing like this. điều đó có nghĩa là that this here is positive. And what else. This played here would be negatively charged. Được rồi. And what happens to this electron. Well initially it has a big vận tốc Đúng. It's given a vận tốc v zero. The question is how fast is it moving when it strikes over here. Vậy what is the lực tác dụng lên the electron. As the electron moves I'm actually going to get rid of this for Bây giờ because I really just want to do a free body diagram over here. Vậy the lực on this electron well again is being attracted by the positive it's being repelled by these. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the lực on the electron has to be in this hướng and that's it. That's the only lực tác dụng lên it. Vậy noon second law says you add up all the các lực. There's only one and that should be equal to the điện tích of the electron the độ lớn multiplied by the độ lớn of the điện trường. And this here has to be equal to mass times the gia tốc. OK. Vậy our gia tốc for our electron is E. The điện tích. The độ lớn of the field and divided by the mass of this electron. I know all the numbers here Vậy in principle I could get a value for the gia tốc of the electron. Bây giờ I'm just going to make a note here saying that it is slowing down Vậy if the gia tốc was big enough it might actually not even reach this plate. Vậy here I guess they're assuming that it does strike the other plate. Vậy let's go ahead and use one of our key nomadic equations. If we're looking for the final tốc độ and we know the khoảng cách one of them is this phương trình here that the vận tốc bình phương equals to the initial vận tốc bình phương plus two times the gia tốc and the độ dời. Delta X. Bây giờ Trong trường hợp này again the gia tốc and the độ dời are in different directions. Vậy one of these is going to have to be negative. Đúng. We're gonna take our coordinate system Vậy that everything that's pointing this way is a positive value. Được. Vậy let's go ahead and substitute in our thing and at the end what we want is just the final vận tốc Vậy all chúng ta có to do is take the square root of everything here. Vậy let's substitute our values. Vậy chúng ta có our initial vận tốc which is Đúng here two point zero times 10 to the seven. You have to square that value plus two times. Bây giờ again it's going to slow down. Vậy really at the end this term is going to end up being negative and that's because the gia tốc is pointing in a different hướng. Đúng. The gia tốc is pointing to the left but our độ dời is to the Đúng. Vậy the gia tốc here should be minus E E. Actually that's good. Go ahead and substitute the numbers. Vậy you should get minus one point six times ten to the negative 19 the điện trường is twelve thousand and all of this divided by the mass of the electron which is nine point one one times 10 to the negative 31. OK. That is my gia tốc and then multiplied by the độ dời Trong trường hợp này it's 40 millimeters. This is 40 times ten to the negative three. OK. Extend that square root. There is a whole bunch of terms in here but at the end all chúng ta có to do is substitute in all our numbers and just be a little bit careful when you evaluate this. OK. At the end I think we should get that the answer again. It's got to be slower Đúng. Vậy actually I could have Đúng away it really eliminated those ones because it will slow down and then we're left with three choices. Put that in your calculator I think you should get choice B which is one point five times 10 to the seven meters per second. OK. Here's problem two says electron is projected Trong trường hợp này it's going up over here with an initial vận tốc of eight point seven times 10 to the 7 along the vertical y axis. OK. And that's kind of in between this plate here that has a separation of 10 centimeters or point one metres. Được rồi. Bây giờ chúng ta có a uniform điện trường in the x hướng. Được. Vậy that's kind of shown over here. If the độ lớn of the gia tốc is measured. Được. This is measured what is the độ lớn of the điện trường between the plates. Được. Well again this one is pretty straightforward I think. Đúng. Again if we go back to our free body diagram again this electron here again the plates here are going to be điện tích if you think about it should be charged like this again. OK. And negative on this side. Bây giờ this problem gives you a lot of additional information. However there is only one lực tác dụng lên that electron and that lực is given by the điện tích multiplied by the field. And that has to be equal to the mass times the gia tốc. Được rồi. Do we know the mass of the electron. Vâng we do. OK. What else. We know the gia tốc that's given in the problem and we know the điện tích. Vậy all we're asking for is the độ lớn of the điện trường. That's this guy Đúng here. Vậy let's just get an expression for it. Vậy it's a mass gia tốc and divided by the điện tích. Again we don't have to worry about the negative side that only tells us the hướng but we know automatically that the electron wants to go toward the positive plate. Vậy here we just substitute in all our numbers the masses nine point 1 1 times 10 to the negative 31 multiplied by the gia tốc that was given in the problem Đúng here. Eight point nine multiplied by 10 to 15. OK. And the last one is divided by the điện tích. That's our one point six times ten to the negative 19. Được rồi. chúng ta có to substitute in all the values over here. And I think you should get 50 1000 roughly. Newton's preschool on. Vậy in that case the correct answer should be choice a Here's problem three. It asks for the độ lớn of the điện trường that will balance a plastic weight that has a massive two point one grams. Được rồi. Vậy here's our plastic weight. And we're going to have a weight which is acting down. That's equal to M.G. and that better be balanced by an lực điện. The lực điện should be acting opposite and that there has a độ lớn equal to 0 the điện tích saw the các điện tích Q Trong trường hợp này. This case is a negative three nano coolant multiplied by the field. Được. And that's it. Vậy the điện trường if you were really to think about it the điện trường should be in this hướng. We're only asking for the độ lớn however and the electric feels in this hướng because the lực is opposite because chúng ta có a negative điện tích. Được. Vậy we want to balance everything out here Vậy chúng ta có QE equals 2 M G E bring the Q on the bottom over here M.G. divided by Q Được rồi. Bây giờ all chúng ta có to do is just substitute in all the values the mass is two point one grams that's two point one multiplied by ten to the negative three multiplied by a little G that's nine point eight and divided by the điện tích điện tích Trong trường hợp này just the độ lớn three times tend to the negative nine cool ohms Được rồi at the end of the day I think you should get a choice a which is six point nine times 10 to the 6:00 news per call on Được rồi that's it for that one. Let's go to next one last problem over here says that a proton is placed in an điện trường with a độ lớn of eight hundred newtons per column what are the độ lớn and hướng of the gia tốc. Được. Vậy here is a proton we know it has a điện tích of positive Vậy imagine Bây giờ it's placed in a field which is just like this. This is the điện trường and the độ lớn is eight hundred. Được rồi. How would you draw a lực on that positive Proton. Again the lực is given by QE and since the điện tích is positive. Our lực điện F has to be simply e multiplied by E and they're in the same hướng because our điện tích is positive. OK. Vậy all we want to do Bây giờ is just to determine the gia tốc. Vậy if this is the only lực tác dụng lên it. Newton's second law says you add up all the các lực and that has to be equal to mass times gia tốc. And again this guy here is simply the điện tích multiplied by the field has the equal mass times gia tốc. Được rồi. Vậy this leads to one final expression for gia tốc is the điện tích the field and divided by the mass. Được rồi let me give myself a little bit more space over here. Vậy the gia tốc is the điện tích one point six times 10 to the negative 19. Our field here has a độ lớn of eight hundred. And again the mass. Bây giờ the mass of the proton is given its one point six seven multiplied by ten to the negative twenty seven. Vậy you've got to put all that in your calculator. And at the end I think you should get something that's going to be looking like this six point sorry seven point six six multiplied by ten to the ten that's in meters per second bình phương. Bây giờ Vậy let's look at all these choices. First of all this one here is the wrong độ lớn. Bây giờ what about the hướng the hướng we said has to be in the same hướng of the điện trường. Vậy can't be opposite. Đúng. Any choice with opposite here that can't be true opposite D also has opposite. And this one here has a different độ lớn actually Vậy C is really the correct answer. It has the hướng that's in the hướng of the điện trường and the độ lớn is also correct. Được rồi. Good job. Hopefully you got all those.
