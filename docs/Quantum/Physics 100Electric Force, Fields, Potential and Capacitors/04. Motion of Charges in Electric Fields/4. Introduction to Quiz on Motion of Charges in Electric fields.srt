Hi everybody.

00:01.060 --> 00:06.450
It's now time to have a look at the motion of charges in electric fields and apply some of our knowledge

00:06.450 --> 00:07.990
to try to solve some problems.

00:08.130 --> 00:14.400
So attached to this video is a PDA just a short quiz so you can practice some of the concepts that you've

00:14.460 --> 00:16.210
learned in the previous sections.

00:16.310 --> 00:17.920
So have a look at the PDA f.

00:17.970 --> 00:23.100
Try some of the problems on your own for kind of short multiple choice problems and then come watch

00:23.100 --> 00:26.170
the next video to see the solutions and see if you understand.

00:26.330 --> 00:26.730
Okay.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.670
Good luck everybody.
