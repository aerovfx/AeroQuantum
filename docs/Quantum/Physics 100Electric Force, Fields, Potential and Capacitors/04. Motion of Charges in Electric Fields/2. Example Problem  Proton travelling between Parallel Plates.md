# Example Problem  Proton travelling between Parallel Plates

## 04. Motion of Charges in Electric Fields

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Here's some of the key information for this problem here. Vậy chúng ta có a charged particle Trong trường hợp này it's going to be a proton if it's a proton. We know the điện tích here is given by one point six times tend to the negative 19 columns and it's a proton. Just look up this number we also know the mass of that điện tích which is one point six seven times tend to the negative 27 kilograms. Bây giờ I've got các bản song song that I've previously charged by connecting it to a battery and the separation between the plates is one centimeter and I have a certain amount of điện tích here positive điện tích on one plate negative điện tích on the other plate such that the điện trường produced by these các điện tích over here is ten thousand Nunes per Coolum. Được rồi. The first thing to xem xét is what happens when this điện tích particles moving upward over here and it's going to enter the field region over here at some point the điện tích particle will enter this region over here. Bây giờ what happens when this charged particle is in the field region. The first thing you have to do is let's do a free body diagram. OK just see what are all the các lực tác dụng lên this điện tích when it's in this điện trường. OK Vậy the free body diagram for this proton here is pretty straightforward. Let's just draw the proton over here. If you look at it first of all this is a positive điện tích Đúng. It's a small positive điện tích little Q and when it's in that field first thing you have to realize is there's going to be an lực điện tác dụng lên this điện tích. lực điện is a véctơ and that véctơ is going to point downward because it is being repelled by the positive điện tích over here and it's being attracted by the negatively charged plate. Vậy the độ lớn of this lực điện is given by QE. Được rồi. And that's really important. And the lực is in the same hướng as the điện trường Trong trường hợp này because this guy here is a positive điện tích. Đúng. Vậy chúng ta có two vectors that are in the same hướng. The next thing you do Bây giờ is you apply new second lot of this problem a new second law says you add up all the các lực tác dụng lên that điện tích. Trong trường hợp này all the các lực are in that vertical hướng here and there's only one lực. Vậy when that atom all up it's simply the lực điện and you add them all up that has to be equal to the mass times the gia tốc. And điều đó có nghĩa là that while hey the gia tốc is going to be in the same hướng as the lực điện. Vậy the electric saw the gia tốc Trong trường hợp này chúng ta có thể get the độ lớn of it. You simply have to divide through by the mass and let's substitute our value for the lực điện. Vậy at the end of the day what we end up getting is this fairly important phương trình over here is that the gia tốc which is Q times the độ lớn of the điện trường and I end up dividing through by the mass over here to isolate the gia tốc. And this is what I'm left with. Bây giờ chúng ta có thể actually get a number for gia tốc here in the key point about this guy here is going to be in the same hướng as the điện trường because the điện tích is positive and mass is always positive. Vậy really the hướng of the gia tốc here this is in the down hướng. Được rồi. The other important thing to xem xét about this problem is this guy over here Đúng. The điện trường for this problem is hằng số. Đúng. This is a hằng số which means it's uniform. Đúng. And if we're between these các bản song song the điện trường is pretty much uniform. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that this gia tốc here is also hằng số. It is also hằng số. And the reason that this is a really really important for this problem is that if the gia tốc is hằng số chúng ta có thể Bây giờ do simple Kitimat. Vậy let's go ahead and set up some kid thematics for this problem to analyze the motion of the charged particle between the two các bản song song. We're gonna have two important kinetic equations here again our gia tốc is hằng số. Here's the độ lớn the hướng we know is down. Vậy the kinetic equations are going to be a number one and number two here. Number one let's just look at the vertical độ dời of this điện tích particle. That's the Y position y position is going to be equal to y 0. Plus the initial vận tốc multiplied by time. And I'm just gonna stick a negative front in this in the front of the gia tốc turn because it's slowing down and the gia tốc is down. It's in the down hướng and I'm defining that down hướng to be the negative hướng. Được rồi. This is my coordinate system here for this particular problem. Everything pointing up is positive everything pointing down is negative. Vậy I've just taken that out of the phương trình. The other thing chúng ta cần to know for this problem is what is the vận tốc of the điện tích particle. Đúng when it enters this field region its vận tốc was initially going up but since the gia tốc is down điều đó có nghĩa là that the điện tích will slow down. OK. It's going to slow down and the expression for the vận tốc is simply going to be like this. The initial vận tốc and again I'll just take the negative sign out multiplied by gia tốc times time and Bây giờ you could see that having this negative sign here is really going to make the vận tốc kind of slow down as time increases. Được rồi. Vậy chúng ta có our two equations and Bây giờ what we want here is we want our maximum độ dời in the y vận tốc we actually want the điện tích particle to actually come and just touch the plate and then come back down like this. Vậy what we want here really is that our y độ dời for this problem is what we want. We want delta y which is my final minus the initial we want this to be the spacing between the plates. That's really important. And the other important thing to do is if we want the điện tích particle to reach this point there is also something else that's going to happen here. Vậy what happens is is going really fast it starts the slow down slow down slow down. Up until it reaches this point at this maximum y độ dời we want the vertical vận tốc here to be equal to zero. Đúng Đúng at the turnaround point. And then after it's going to start speeding up it's speeding up in the down hướng. Vậy Đúng at this point here this is really important expression here is that our vertical vận tốc has to be equal to zero. Vậy Bây giờ if we go back here and xem xét our phương trình to Well if you substitute Bây giờ v y is equal to zero what you can do is you can find how much time it takes for this điện tích particle to slow down and to reach this point over here. Vậy let's go ahead and do that chúng ta có thể tính toán that. And what you're going to find here. Vậy go and substitute it into phương trình 2 We want zero equal to my initial vận tốc and minus the gia tốc times time and Bây giờ what I do is simply substitute the expression for the gia tốc that expression for gia tốc was the độ lớn of the điện tích độ lớn of the field divided by the mass and multiplied by the time. Vậy at the end the time for the vận tốc to reach zero. You simply have to do a little bit of algebra. Bây giờ bring this on the other side and divide through by this term here in the bracket. I'm going to rearrange things a little bit and my expression is going to look like this Vậy this is how much time it takes for the vận tốc to be equal to zero. Được rồi. The next thing we want to do Bây giờ is well we know what our vertical độ dời is. All chúng ta có to do Bây giờ is go back to phương trình 1. Bây giờ chúng ta có the time Bây giờ that we could substitute in here. And my goal Bây giờ will be simply to solve what is that initial vận tốc Vậy that it makes it all the way to the other plate. Vậy let's go ahead on the other page and do this math Được rồi. The next thing we want and Bây giờ is we wanted our vertical độ dời rewrite phương trình one over here. This tells me my y position equals the initial position plus initial vận tốc times. Time and again minus one half 80 bình phương. And really what we want Trong trường hợp này we want our delta y to be equal to the spacing between the plates. Vậy let's go ahead and do that. If we do that is bring this guy on the other side and that becomes delta y. Được rồi delta y is always a Y minus some initial value. Vậy let's simplify phương trình 1 Vậy we get that the khoảng cách between the plates and this is really what we want time minus one half a T bình phương Bây giờ the next thing chúng ta có remember is how much time it takes for when the vận tốc equals to zero. Đúng. And we just want that điện tích particle to reach the other plate. Vậy all you have to do Bây giờ is simply substitute the time for our expression up above. Được. And you could also substitute gia tốc for Bây giờ. Let me just kind of do it this way. Let's go over here Vậy chúng ta có the khoảng cách between the plates. I'll just keep the v y over here and for my expression for time Bây giờ rather than doing the second expression let's just start off with just this one v zero divided by the gia tốc that'll make the math a little bit easier. We won't have Vậy many variables to tackle over here. Let's keep gia tốc like this. And Bây giờ chúng ta có this T bình phương and T again is initial vận tốc divided by gia tốc and we square that term. Bây giờ you do a little bit of algebra what you end up getting is you get v 0 bình phương divided by a and then minus one half. And if you look at this other term here this becomes a and this becomes v zero bình phương and this becomes a bình phương. I have a look at this term you have an a here and you have two of them over here Vậy you can get rid of one and these two terms are exactly the same except the second one has a coefficient of 1 1/2 in the front of it. Vậy at the end this is our expression for our độ dời is 1 1/2 v 0 bình phương divided by gia tốc. Được rồi. And remember our problem Đúng the gia tốc for this problem we know what it was the gia tốc was pretty straightforward It was the điện tích multiplied by the điện trường and divided by the mass and rather than putting the mass kind of down below. If I'm dividing I could just bring it to the top over here and this is my final expression over here for the khoảng cách between the plates which I know. Vậy the only unknown Bây giờ in this problem is what is v zero. Vậy chúng ta có to do a little bit of math over here just isolate the V zero you bring a couple terms over to the other side. Divide by the mass and then take the square root of everything and this is what we end up getting. Vậy v zero end up the square root of a whole bunch of different terms here. Vậy we get to Q The khoảng cách between the plates multiplied by the điện trường and all of this gets divided by by the mass Được rồi here. Here chúng ta có it folks. Vậy this would be the vận tốc such that if you give that charged particle that proton this vận tốc over here you're gonna end up that the điện tích particle is just going to make it to the other side. Được Vậy all you have to do Bây giờ is simply substitute in the numbers. Let's go ahead and do that. You substitute the numbers over here we get kind of a big expression. We'll get to one point six times ten to the negative 19 the khoảng cách between the plates was 1 centimeter. Vậy this is zero point zero one meter. What else. The điện trường was 10000 10000 Newtons per cool. That's already an S.I. units we don't have to convert anything in the last part. Here was the mass the mass is one point six seven times ten to the negative twenty seven kilograms. Put that all put all of that in the calculator. You should get something like this one point three eight times tend to the five. And again that will be in meters per second. Được rồi. I have everything here in S.I. units. Vậy if that điện tích particle has this particular vận tốc here which is just a number here at the end of the day it's actually going to just make it to the other plate and then turn around and then come back. Let's go ahead and see how chúng ta có thể set this problem up. Bây giờ using bảo toàn năng lượng Đúng to solve this problem using bảo toàn năng lượng let's xem xét that this bottom plate position is going to be my initial position and this top plate here is my final position. And what chúng ta có here is that the total energy at this point has to be equal to the total energy at my final position. Vậy initially what chúng ta có is a lot of động năng and we're going to be moving in a region where there's an điện trường. Guess what we're also going to have some electrical thế energy. When I first enter this field region and as I move Bây giờ toward the other plate and once my I reached the other side and if I just kind of turn around over here điều đó có nghĩa là that my vận tốc or my tốc độ is zero once I'm at the other plate. Vậy my final động năng over here at the top. K. final Allen's easy that has to be equal to zero. And that energy had to go somewhere. Vậy actually it's going to be converted into electrical thế energy which I'm going to call you final. Vậy the initial động năng is really straightforward. I simply have a điện tích particle a proton it's moving Vậy that guy always the same thing one half mass of that điện tích multiplied by that initial vận tốc. And let's just rewrite all of these other terms and you final. Vậy there's Không final động năng for this problem. Vậy all we really have to do is evaluate what is this thế energy over here. Được rồi. thế energy if you remember Bây giờ from your class you probably saw that the thế energy of a charged particle Trong trường hợp này the các điện tích Q or remember this little guy over here had a điện tích q and I'm placing it Bây giờ in a region where there's an điện trường the amount of energy that a điện tích has when it's in a region of điện trường can be written as this it's the điện tích multiplied by the value of the electrical thế. Đúng. Vậy this guy here is electrical thế This is the value of the điện tích and this is how much energy you have at least thế energy. Vậy our goal Bây giờ is what chúng ta cần to tính toán. What is this value. What is the value of V. When I am close to this plate. Vậy what is the value of V initial over here and what is the value of V final. If I know that I can tính toán both of these thế energy terms and then simply solve for that initial vận tốc. Vậy carefully I am using an uppercase V to note the electrical thế versus the initial vận tốc here which is lowercase v zero. Được rồi. Vậy how do we relate that. And this is pretty simple for các bản song song. OK. Vậy you're to write this down the expression that I'm writing down here is only valid for các bản song song. Vậy don't try to use it for point các điện tích. Don't try to use it for cylinders and for this case it's pretty simple it simply says that. Again remember how would we actually obtain the system we would plug it into a battery. Đúng. You'd plug it into a battery and the hiệu điện thế hiệu between the battery I can write as V file minus V initial. This is the thế hiệu of that of the terminals of this battery that there simply equals two and I'm just writing it as the độ lớn here as I call this Ed's công thức because it's simply e the độ lớn of the điện trường multiplied by the khoảng cách between the plates. Vậy Trong trường hợp này here if I have ten thousand a nuance per column and the khoảng cách between the plates I had previously said that the khoảng cách between the plates we call it D. And that was one centimeter Vậy if I go ahead here and multiply this by convert it to meters which you end up getting here is one hundred Vôn. That's the hiệu of thế. Vậy that might mean here that the hiệu has to be one hundred Vậy he might have this one here at plus fifty Vôn and you might have this one here at negative fifty Vôn Đúng Vậy that would mean that the hiệu v final minus V initial over here 50 minus minus fifty would give me one hundred Vôn. Vậy Bây giờ let's go ahead and do that just substitute our values over here. Let's go back to the expression for bảo toàn năng lượng and all we really want to do Bây giờ is substitute our expressions for the electrical thế energy. Vậy chúng ta có our động năng one half and the initial bình phương. Bây giờ the initial thế energy as I enter the field region is the điện tích q multiplied by the value of that thế. And that there has to be equal to the final thế energy Vậy it's the điện tích q minus V. Final. Bây giờ you have to do a little bit of algebra too because our goal was the final. How fast do I have to put this điện tích in the field region. Vậy let's go ahead and do that. Vậy I'm going to bring this term on the other side Vậy this becomes Q This is v final minus V initial Đúng. This is the hiệu of thế between both of those plates which we just said was 100 Vôn and all of this here has to be equal to my initial động năng. And Bây giờ again you do a little bit of algebra because my goal was to find v zero. Vậy there's gonna be a square root term over here. S we're gonna have the square root. I bring the two over next door I get to Q The hiệu of thế which is call that delta v and again divided by the mass m. Bây giờ this expression might look a little bit different from the previous one because the previous one remember I had it in terms of the điện trường and the khoảng cách D. However that's what this guy is Đúng here. Vậy if you go back and you substitute that you're gonna get the exact same expression as we previously had in that when I know the value you substitute all these values here you're going to get one point three eight times 10 to the five. And again that is going to be in meters per second I'm working in s units over here and that's it. That's how you would do this problem Bây giờ using bảo toàn năng lượng. I think the key is really just finding what this hiệu of voltages between the plates and you can do that. Using this Ed's công thức what I call and again the key to remember here is that this công thức here is only valid for các bản song song if you have different systems of điện tích ví dụ charged cylinders the expression is going to look a little bit different than the simple expression. The reason it looks Vậy simple for các bản song song is because the điện trường is uniform here. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the hiệu điện thế varies linearly with khoảng cách between the plates.
