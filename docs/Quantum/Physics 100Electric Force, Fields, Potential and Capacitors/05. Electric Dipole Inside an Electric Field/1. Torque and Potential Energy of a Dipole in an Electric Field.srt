00:00.760 --> 00:01.710
Hi everyone.

00:01.710 --> 00:04.710
Today I want to look at another problem in electoral statics.

00:04.830 --> 00:08.280
I want to look at a dipole placed in an electric field this time.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.400
So we're going to get a couple different cases.

00:11.400 --> 00:15.930
I'm going to start with the simplest which is just a couple of dye Poles placed in a constant electric

00:15.930 --> 00:16.960
field.

00:17.010 --> 00:18.600
We're gonna look at the talk on the dipole.

00:18.600 --> 00:24.120
We're going to look at the energy associated with rotating a dye pole in that field and in the second

00:24.120 --> 00:28.770
case I want to actually make the field very in space.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.530
So we place the dipole in an in homogeneous electric field.

00:32.590 --> 00:33.780
We're going to see what happens to it.

00:34.590 --> 00:37.950
So here are a couple of cases there's dipole no one cares dipole number two.

00:38.300 --> 00:43.580
And now I'm going to place it in an electric field one.

00:44.430 --> 00:47.010
That's just make the field lines uniform.

00:47.760 --> 00:53.770
So I'm not telling you what produces the electric field I'm just telling you there is one in space and

00:53.770 --> 00:59.620
I'm placing dipole number one at an angle with respect to the electric field and dipole number to them

00:59.620 --> 01:00.960
and to place it at a different angle.

01:00.970 --> 01:06.730
With respect to the electric field so let's go see what's going to happen to these dye poles.

01:06.790 --> 01:10.520
First thing we can look at are the forces acting on the individual charges.

01:10.640 --> 01:14.170
No we have a dipole so that has a positive charge and negative charge.

01:14.170 --> 01:15.580
Separated by a distance

01:18.520 --> 01:24.130
there will be an electric force acting on the positive charge and electric forces in the same direction

01:24.130 --> 01:26.260
as the electric field.

01:26.500 --> 01:31.650
The electric force acting on the negative charge is going to be in this direction.

01:31.990 --> 01:34.100
The electric force is in the opposite direction.

01:34.100 --> 01:37.130
The electric field for negative charges.

01:37.150 --> 01:38.080
Well what about this guy.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.780
Let's look at dipole number two.

01:39.780 --> 01:41.680
Let's look at all the forces acting on dipole.

01:41.680 --> 01:48.400
Number two we have electric force acting on the positive side and we have a force acting on the negative

01:48.400 --> 01:49.480
side.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.060
So there is a difference between both of these pictures right.

01:55.480 --> 02:03.250
In case number one you notice that both of these forces are acting in opposite directions and they're

02:03.250 --> 02:09.900
going to tend to make the object rotate like this dipole will rotate in an electric field Hello.

02:09.900 --> 02:16.990
Case number two case number two simply have forces that are tending to stretch the dipole they don't

02:16.990 --> 02:19.570
tend to make the object rotate.

02:19.700 --> 02:19.990
OK.

02:20.020 --> 02:25.300
So when we're going to look at this a little bit more detail in a minute you're going to see that these

02:25.300 --> 02:32.690
forces on a dipole and this orientation will produce a talk on the dipole.

02:33.010 --> 02:38.640
Whereas if the dipole is oriented in the direction of the field or opposite of the field we're going

02:38.630 --> 02:44.830
to show that there is no torque because these forces don't tend to make the object rotate.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.090
Where in this case they do.

02:46.930 --> 02:52.870
So let's go to the interactive whiteboard and look at a couple specific examples.

02:52.900 --> 02:53.140
OK.

02:53.170 --> 02:59.890
So here we have our dipole again placed in our field the positive and negative charges are separated

02:59.890 --> 03:01.950
by distance let's call it D.

03:03.110 --> 03:08.660
And what I want to do now is I want to look at the torque produced by each one of these forces.

03:08.710 --> 03:16.270
So in order to calculate the the talk I remember that the force first has a magnitude of the charge

03:17.170 --> 03:19.430
times the electric field.

03:19.930 --> 03:25.690
And if we want to look at the torque produced by a constant force remember what that was.

03:25.690 --> 03:27.190
It was the distance to the pivot.

03:27.220 --> 03:28.880
Let's put the pivot right at the midpoint.

03:29.020 --> 03:30.470
So the distance to the pivot.

03:30.640 --> 03:35.840
So that's where the force is being applied is deep over to.

03:36.220 --> 03:45.740
It's the magnitude of the force which is f multiplied now times sign of the angle theta.

03:46.020 --> 03:53.480
And remember with the angle theta is in this particular case the angle theta is defined as this and

03:53.500 --> 03:59.050
that is the torque produced on or by the force acting on the positive charge.

03:59.050 --> 04:04.690
We also have to consider the torque produced by the force down over here on the negative charge.

04:04.690 --> 04:06.870
That one's going to have the exact same magnitude.

04:06.910 --> 04:12.130
The distance to the pivot is d over to the magnitude of the force is the same because we're looking

04:12.130 --> 04:17.130
at a dipole and the charge is the same and sign of the angle theta.

04:18.220 --> 04:23.250
Okay so we're just about done here and we want to look at the network.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.030
Remember this year only gives you the magnitude.

04:25.030 --> 04:29.860
However the direction is going to be the same for both of them.

04:29.860 --> 04:32.320
Let me add the directional were here.

04:32.620 --> 04:37.870
If this force over here on the positive charge is the only force acting on the system it's going to

04:37.870 --> 04:41.540
tend to make it rotate clockwise.

04:41.540 --> 04:42.860
How about the negative one.

04:42.880 --> 04:48.010
Again if the force down here is the only force acting on the dipole it's going to also tend to make

04:48.010 --> 04:49.670
it rotate clockwise.

04:49.810 --> 04:51.380
That's in the same direction.

04:51.430 --> 04:54.510
Therefore both of those vectors are in the same direction.

04:54.940 --> 05:02.290
So the net torque is simply going to be just the sum of both of those at the end of the day you get

05:02.530 --> 05:06.700
to and since they have the exact same magnitude.

05:06.790 --> 05:12.550
I'll go ahead now and substitute in the magnitude of the force F which is simply the charge times the

05:12.550 --> 05:15.890
magnitude of the field time sign of theta.

05:16.090 --> 05:21.650
And that's our net torque acting on the dipole.

05:21.690 --> 05:23.620
I could simplify this a little bit.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.400
This too will cancel without one.

05:26.090 --> 05:33.980
Let's go ahead and just write our final equation for the talk on a dipole can be written as Q D.

05:35.530 --> 05:41.120
E sign of theta so that's kind of a useful formula here.

05:41.130 --> 05:49.020
Remember you can also take this a step further and that's typically what people do is we're going to

05:49.020 --> 05:57.030
define a quantity and define a quantity you call the dipole moment.

05:57.030 --> 06:03.610
And in this case it's the electric dipole moment the electric dipole moment.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.700
We give it the letter P.

06:05.700 --> 06:11.820
It's actually going to be a vector and the magnitude of the vector is simply going to be the charge

06:11.820 --> 06:12.770
of the dipole.

06:13.290 --> 06:20.670
So the charge of either the positive or the negative multiplied times the distance between the two charges

06:21.390 --> 06:31.800
and the direction the convention is it points toward the positive charge points toward

06:34.750 --> 06:38.280
positive charge.

06:38.780 --> 06:47.780
OK so in this figure here if I'm going to plot with his vector P looks like the vector P basically points

06:47.780 --> 06:51.170
in this direction here.

06:51.390 --> 06:54.820
That is our dipole moment associated with that dipole.

06:54.930 --> 07:01.590
And the reason we're gonna want to define a dipole moment is because the talk now you can actually write

07:01.590 --> 07:04.510
it as a vector equation.

07:04.580 --> 07:16.290
The talk is a vector can be written very simply as our dipole moment vector cross product with the electric

07:16.290 --> 07:19.040
field.

07:19.910 --> 07:20.630
So there you have it.

07:20.630 --> 07:24.110
That is the same equation as the one I wrote up here.

07:24.110 --> 07:31.520
Remember how you expand a cross product is you take the magnitude of one vector multiplied by the magnitude

07:31.520 --> 07:37.130
of the other vector and then you multiply by sign of the angle between the two vectors.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.600
So in this specific case let me draw the vectors on the side here.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.650
So we have our dipole moment vector which is like this.

07:45.650 --> 07:50.690
It has a vector P which has a magnitude of the charge.

07:50.690 --> 07:59.380
Times the distance between the two our vector E is in this direction.

08:00.290 --> 08:06.050
That's the direction the electric field and the angle theta that goes into our talk equation is the

08:06.050 --> 08:12.400
angle between the dipole moment vector and the electric field vector.

08:13.390 --> 08:23.280
So in this direction here ends up being perpendicular to the dipole moment vector and the electric field

08:23.280 --> 08:24.650
vector.

08:25.470 --> 08:31.560
If things are in the plane like this usually you can pick a direction for the talk is being either clockwise

08:31.560 --> 08:35.730
or counterclockwise and that's kind of what I've done up here.

08:38.080 --> 08:47.490
OK so there you have it folks there is the talk of produced by an electric field on a dipole so it depends

08:47.490 --> 08:48.350
on the angle.

08:48.450 --> 08:52.680
We have our general equation here which is P E sign of theta.

08:52.950 --> 08:57.090
So we have a couple specific cases to look at.

08:57.090 --> 09:01.640
For example when is the torque a maximum value

09:04.960 --> 09:12.970
well for any given Dipole which has a dipole moment P the maximum angle or the maximum torque will be

09:12.970 --> 09:16.390
produced when sign of theta equals the one.

09:16.630 --> 09:23.680
When we have sign of theta equals the one that's going to produce the maximum torque for any given electric

09:23.680 --> 09:32.530
field and dipole and we get that when the dipole moment P is perpendicular to the electric field.

09:32.740 --> 09:42.340
Because in that case our angle theta is actually 90 degrees and the torque simply going to be the dipole

09:42.340 --> 09:47.680
moment times the electric field time sign of 90 which is 1.

09:47.740 --> 09:48.310
So that's it.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.300
The magnitude of the talk is simply this.

09:53.800 --> 09:59.530
If you want to write it now in terms of the charge remember you can simply do that with the charge.

09:59.530 --> 10:03.810
Times the distance between the positive and negative charge.

10:03.970 --> 10:08.630
Times the electric field and that's the magnitude of the talk.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.860
Okay so let's compare the two cases I had on a board now.

10:13.860 --> 10:18.810
So we have dipole one which is located in a constant electric field.

10:18.850 --> 10:25.720
However it makes an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the electric field whereas in case number two

10:26.140 --> 10:31.120
you have the dipole that's in the same direction as the electric field and in both cases we want to

10:31.120 --> 10:33.710
look at the torque acting on the dipole.

10:33.760 --> 10:39.160
Again we can look at each individual charge look at the forces however I want to use the formulae we

10:39.160 --> 10:46.500
had in the previous case which said that the talk is p cross E for both cases.

10:46.510 --> 10:50.760
Remember how that vector P was defined that was our dipole moment.

10:51.190 --> 11:02.200
The vector P was the charge q TIMES the distance between the two charges and the direction was from

11:02.350 --> 11:04.680
the negative to the positive.

11:05.950 --> 11:08.560
Negative to positive.

11:09.970 --> 11:17.710
So let's draw the vectors P and E for both of these cases for dipole 1 and dipole number 2.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.980
So here's what we have for dipole number 1.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.740
Here's the vector P.

11:23.740 --> 11:24.910
Here's our electric field

11:28.650 --> 11:32.820
and I've said that the angle here was 30 degrees

11:37.030 --> 11:37.610
all right.

11:37.610 --> 11:40.730
Compare that to case number two case number two.

11:40.730 --> 11:45.150
Again our dipole moment vector goes from negative to positive.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.240
So in that case it's the same magnitude.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.450
However the orientation is different.

11:49.610 --> 11:57.380
That's the direction of P and the direction of e is also in this direction.

11:57.410 --> 12:03.400
So in this case the angle between them is equal to zero degrees.

12:03.560 --> 12:08.120
So if we apply our torque equation and we want to find how big the talk is so let's just look at the

12:08.120 --> 12:12.080
magnitude of the torque the magnitude of the talk or simply BP.

12:13.420 --> 12:23.690
E time sign of 30 degrees so that's q TIMES THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHARGE.

12:23.690 --> 12:29.360
Times the magnitude of the field and sign of 30 degrees.

12:30.470 --> 12:31.520
So one last step.

12:31.520 --> 12:35.980
Q d e divided by two.

12:36.320 --> 12:42.770
All right compare that to this case the net torque acting on dipole number two is simply going to be

12:42.770 --> 12:45.150
PS The same is the same.

12:45.290 --> 12:50.660
However we have sign of zero degrees and sign of zero degrees is zero.

12:50.660 --> 12:58.790
Therefore the net torque acting on dipole number two is zero whereas the net torque for dipole number

12:58.800 --> 13:03.270
one definitely non-zero.

13:03.350 --> 13:10.740
So what we're gonna have here is in this case we're going to get some rotation of the dipole.

13:10.940 --> 13:12.880
In this case no rotation

13:18.080 --> 13:18.670
I'm.

13:18.730 --> 13:23.680
You look at the potential energy of a dive hole in a field again I'm going to use this definition of

13:23.680 --> 13:28.540
our electric dipole moment which is a vector that pointed from the negative charge to the positive charge

13:31.400 --> 13:38.720
and we can write the potential energy of a dipole in a constant electric field in terms of the electric

13:38.720 --> 13:44.870
field as dipole moment as p dot e.

13:44.870 --> 13:51.110
This is a scalar product so if you want to write that in terms of the angle between both of those vectors

13:51.600 --> 14:01.940
and just in terms of the magnitudes simply minus p e times cos of theta so that's kind of an important

14:01.940 --> 14:02.480
equation.

14:04.160 --> 14:12.200
So again the energy can range over a whole whole series of values because the angle fade I can place

14:12.200 --> 14:18.740
this dipole at any orientation with respect to the electric field you can look at when the potential

14:18.740 --> 14:21.200
energy is a maximum.

14:21.210 --> 14:27.980
So when when we have a maximum value for this potential energy we'd have a maximum value whenever the

14:28.760 --> 14:37.250
angle theta is equal to 180 degrees when the angle theta is equal to 180 degrees cos of 1 A.D. minus

14:37.250 --> 14:38.290
1.

14:38.330 --> 14:47.450
So the energy of the dipole in the field is P is you get minus p e times coast of 180 which is minus

14:47.450 --> 14:55.400
1 which cancels with the original one we get a minimum value of the potential energy when the angle

14:55.520 --> 14:57.230
theta equal to zero.

14:57.230 --> 15:01.590
In that case that's when the dipole moment is aligned with the electric field.

15:01.610 --> 15:07.370
In that case you have a minimum potential energy and the energy of the dipole in this case is minus

15:07.370 --> 15:14.930
p and there is a case where the potential energy is equal to zero right the potential energy equals

15:14.930 --> 15:25.940
to zero when the angle is 90 degrees in that case zero is when our angle theta equals 90 degrees the

15:25.940 --> 15:30.970
potential energy of the dipole is equal to zero.

15:30.990 --> 15:31.980
Okay.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.680
The actual values of potential energy aren't really that interesting.

15:35.750 --> 15:41.420
What's more interesting is when you change all right when we change the energy or when we try to rotate

15:41.420 --> 15:47.530
the dipole we might be asked how much work is needed to rotate a dipole in an electric field.

15:47.540 --> 15:50.540
We know there's forces that the field produces on the charge.

15:50.540 --> 15:53.860
So if I wanted to rotate I have to do work on the system.

15:54.140 --> 15:57.350
So let's look at this specific case here down at the bottom that I've sketched out.

15:57.950 --> 16:03.350
So I have an initial dipole where the dipole moment is aligned in the same direction as my electric

16:03.350 --> 16:11.120
field shown in red and in the final position I simply want to rotate this dipole by 180 degrees by some

16:11.120 --> 16:16.580
mechanism I'm not really showing you but I'm just giving you the initial and the final steps.

16:16.580 --> 16:21.710
What the orientation of dipole looks like in the field and we want to calculate how much energy is stored

16:21.710 --> 16:26.360
in the system or how much work did you have to do to accomplish this.

16:26.390 --> 16:31.240
So calculate how much work you needed to do.

16:31.340 --> 16:38.040
You simply have to look at the work needed.

16:38.260 --> 16:41.550
Basically just the change in potential energy.

16:42.070 --> 16:43.180
If you're not sure about this.

16:43.180 --> 16:44.820
Think about just the mass right.

16:44.860 --> 16:52.840
If I just have a mass on the ground and I want to lift it up all the way up to here and lift it up through

16:52.840 --> 16:59.380
some height if I want to know how much energy is required to do this all you have to do is simply compare

16:59.380 --> 17:03.280
the potential energy at the top versus the bottom.

17:03.460 --> 17:08.770
In this case you usually set the potential energy equal to zero at the bottom and the potential energy

17:08.770 --> 17:11.390
in the final step is simply M.G. H.

17:12.760 --> 17:19.330
So the amount of energy required to raise this mass a certain distance H is simply equal to M.G. H.

17:19.330 --> 17:23.430
You look at the change of potential energy in the system.

17:23.590 --> 17:29.800
That's exactly what we're going to do here for the dipole except the potential energy is not simply

17:29.800 --> 17:34.870
given by the mass times the gravity times the height above the ground.

17:35.050 --> 17:41.050
The potential energy for a dipole in a field is given by our other expression here which is negative

17:41.250 --> 17:46.470
dipole moment times the electric field times cos of the angle between both of those vectors.

17:46.690 --> 17:50.260
So the work needed is the change in potential energy.

17:50.260 --> 17:55.770
That's a final potential energy minus an initial potential energy.

17:55.790 --> 17:59.160
Now those are going to be different from each other because the angle is different in each case.

17:59.170 --> 18:00.280
You got to be a little bit careful.

18:00.280 --> 18:05.310
So our final value is simply well how did we start we started.

18:06.210 --> 18:12.010
So our final value is shown down here and that's the case where the angle is 180 between the dipole

18:12.010 --> 18:14.140
moment and the electric field.

18:14.140 --> 18:16.080
I've actually calculated that one right here.

18:16.150 --> 18:24.400
That was the value of the potential energy of the dipole in the field and so it's simply P minus What's

18:24.400 --> 18:28.770
the initial value in the initial configuration the dipole moment is a line in the same direction of

18:28.770 --> 18:29.870
the field.

18:29.950 --> 18:35.410
That is when the angle is zero degrees have shown that one here and the potential energy is negative

18:35.410 --> 18:38.140
P.

18:38.590 --> 18:41.410
So when you include everything together the work needed

18:46.690 --> 18:53.900
it's simply going to be two times the magnitude of the dipole moment.

18:54.040 --> 19:00.100
Times the magnitude of the electric field and that is going to be a quantity that's going to have units

19:00.100 --> 19:07.670
of joules corresponds to the amount of energy that's required in order to accomplish this.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.720
Notice we're gonna get a positive number.

19:09.850 --> 19:14.710
We're gonna get a positive number because we have to do work against the electric field in order to

19:14.710 --> 19:16.320
rotate this object.

19:16.330 --> 19:18.080
It's not going to rotate by itself.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.150
You have to put energy into the system.

19:20.350 --> 19:25.940
And this is how much energy you need to put in in order to rotate this dipole.

19:26.780 --> 19:26.990
OK.

19:27.010 --> 19:31.600
Now when to look at what happens when the electric field is not constant compared to the constant case

19:31.600 --> 19:32.640
over here.

19:32.640 --> 19:37.780
Now let's just look at the talk the talk for case number one where the dipole moment is a line in the

19:37.780 --> 19:42.730
same direction the field we just saw that the net torque was equal to zero.

19:42.730 --> 19:51.540
We had forces acting to the right on the positive charge force acting to the left on the negative charge.

19:52.090 --> 19:59.320
And those forces didn't produce any rotation for the case down or illustrated in the bottom figure if

19:59.320 --> 20:00.880
the fuel is constant.

20:01.000 --> 20:09.770
Again we had forces acting at a certain distance from the pivot and those forces produced a torque right

20:09.790 --> 20:12.280
they would tend to make the object rotate clockwise

20:14.710 --> 20:16.340
clockwise rotation.

20:16.570 --> 20:24.630
The magnitude of the talk was given by our dipole moment the magnitude of the electric field times a

20:24.850 --> 20:28.120
sign of the angle between them.

20:28.120 --> 20:33.940
If you substituted in our value for the dipole moment or the magnitude of the dipole moment which is

20:33.940 --> 20:40.510
simply Q times D sine and theta so that's the talk.

20:40.630 --> 20:47.590
One thing I didn't mentioned before however it's very very important when you write this down is the

20:47.590 --> 20:54.400
forces for case number two even for case number one the forces balance out actually is although they

20:54.400 --> 20:57.320
do produce a talk for case number two.

20:57.610 --> 21:06.160
The net force acting on the dipole is equal to zero because the charge is the same.

21:06.160 --> 21:07.990
The electric field is the same.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.740
These forces are equal in opposite directions.

21:11.740 --> 21:18.960
They produce a torque however they don't produce an acceleration of the dipole.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.730
You'll simply rotate it.

21:20.800 --> 21:27.830
You're not going to move the dipole you're not going to lead to any translational motion of the dipole.

21:27.830 --> 21:34.510
And that's kind of the big important point and the biggest difference here between the case where the

21:34.870 --> 21:40.320
electric fuel is constant versus when the electric field varies in space.

21:40.870 --> 21:41.940
So let's have a look at it.

21:42.300 --> 21:48.080
Okay so now let's compare the case where the key where the electric field is not uniform in space.

21:48.220 --> 21:53.140
For that I'm going to look at the fuel produced by negative charge and I'm going to place the dipole

21:54.400 --> 22:02.830
with its dipole moment aligned pointing toward the negative charge and making some angle that is shown

22:02.830 --> 22:04.870
in the bottom figure over here.

22:05.020 --> 22:08.140
So let's look at the forces acting on the dipole.

22:08.230 --> 22:13.480
Well you're gonna have an attractive force between the positive part of the dipole and the negative

22:13.480 --> 22:15.890
charge.

22:15.890 --> 22:23.510
So that's going to be a force pointing to the right and you're also going to have a repulsive force

22:23.640 --> 22:30.060
draw it in a different shade here because these two negatives will repel each other.

22:30.290 --> 22:35.850
So you're going to have another force pointing to the left this time.

22:36.260 --> 22:39.920
Let's call that f 2 and call our first one EF 1.

22:39.950 --> 22:46.820
Now one thing that is different from the case of the constant electric field is that both of the vectors

22:46.820 --> 22:51.510
for the constant field both of the force vectors had the same magnitude.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.600
In this case f 1

22:57.260 --> 23:03.520
in magnitude is going to be bigger than 2.

23:03.710 --> 23:07.330
Therefore there's going to be a net force acting on it.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.100
The net force is not equal to zero.

23:10.250 --> 23:18.560
Like in this case this net force acting on the dipole was equal to zero.

23:18.560 --> 23:27.490
So that means when the dipole is gonna be attracted to the negative charge if there's a net force there's

23:27.500 --> 23:28.670
gonna be an acceleration.

23:33.560 --> 23:40.250
How about the torque well even in this case here there is no torque although there's a net force acting

23:40.250 --> 23:40.920
on it.

23:40.970 --> 23:50.510
The torque acting on the dipole is going to be zero and you can see that just by looking at the figure.

23:50.920 --> 23:56.300
All of these forces do as the forces tend to make the object stretch right.

23:56.320 --> 24:02.680
They're acting in opposite directions but there's no rotation no rotation

24:06.680 --> 24:07.790
all right.

24:08.120 --> 24:13.610
Now take the case now where our dipole moment is again at some angle.

24:13.670 --> 24:21.620
With respect to the axis joining the negative charge producing another electric field in this particular

24:21.620 --> 24:26.320
case again we can look at the forces acting on the dipole and the forces.

24:26.380 --> 24:29.080
You're gonna have an attractive force acting this way.

24:31.460 --> 24:37.170
And you're going to have again a repulsive force acting away from it.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.920
Now these vectors have a

24:42.640 --> 24:44.120
different directions number one.

24:44.140 --> 24:46.560
So you're still going to have a net force acting on them.

24:46.750 --> 24:51.430
Both of these -- vectors will never cancel out to give you zero net force because they're in different

24:51.430 --> 24:52.600
directions.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.400
So we're gonna have a net force

24:57.560 --> 24:59.560
not equal to zero.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.770
In addition you're gonna have a net torque.

25:03.250 --> 25:08.320
You can calculate the torque by looking at each individual component and repeating the steps we did

25:08.320 --> 25:12.040
for the regular dial and a constant field.

25:12.040 --> 25:17.260
You can place a pivot here at the center of the dipole and look at the total torque produced by each

25:17.260 --> 25:19.860
force and then add them up as vectors.

25:19.960 --> 25:27.400
So we'd have to do the torque produced by the force F one as a vector plus the torque produced by the

25:27.400 --> 25:30.400
force F 2 is a vector.

25:30.400 --> 25:35.920
Each one of these cases I can use my equation I can use it's the distance to the pivot.

25:36.070 --> 25:42.270
It's the magnitude of the force and time sign the angle between them.

25:42.270 --> 25:42.480
OK.

25:42.520 --> 25:48.190
You'd have to do a little bit more algebra but the key point is that you can have a net force in this

25:48.190 --> 25:50.980
case and you can also have a net torque.

25:51.010 --> 25:55.350
This is to actually calculate the magnitude is a little bit more complicated

26:00.060 --> 26:06.520
however the concepts should be clear just by looking at the force diagrams okay.

26:06.530 --> 26:12.810
So just to summarize the key points we define a new vector today called the DI Paul moment.

26:15.100 --> 26:22.090
Dipole moment we gave it the letter P and the magnitude anyway it was the charge q of the dipole multiplied

26:22.240 --> 26:29.770
times the distance between the two charges and the direction was from the negative toward the positive

26:29.770 --> 26:32.620
charge of the dipole.

26:32.620 --> 26:37.870
This was particularly useful because you can then use the definition of dipole moment to look at the

26:37.880 --> 26:40.030
torque acting on a dipole.

26:40.360 --> 26:46.480
And the talk is simply written as P cross e and if you write that in terms of the magnitude of the torque

26:47.260 --> 26:53.830
you simply have the magnitude of the vector P the magnitude of our electric field and there's also that

26:53.860 --> 26:59.110
angular dependence that was really important because there's some orientations in the diaper hole in

26:59.110 --> 27:06.310
a field where there is no torque acting on it for example if it's parallel or a. parallel.

27:06.910 --> 27:16.120
The other important point that was that the net force of a dipole in a constant electric field is zero

27:16.820 --> 27:17.640
is constant

27:21.260 --> 27:27.860
because you have equal and opposite forces they don't produce a net force acting on the dipole.

27:27.980 --> 27:30.250
We also discuss potential energy.

27:30.530 --> 27:37.170
And we looked at a case where the dipole was placed in a constant electric field.

27:37.190 --> 27:41.910
In that case the potential energy of the dipole is simply minus Pitot e.

27:42.360 --> 27:49.990
If you expand that scalar product you simply have pea coat of theta.

27:50.140 --> 27:56.850
Now the actual individual values of the potential energy are really not that interesting.

27:56.860 --> 28:04.240
What's more interesting is when you change the potential energy of a dipole so you either have to do

28:04.240 --> 28:07.360
work or electric field does work

28:12.080 --> 28:13.610
work on the dipole.

28:13.640 --> 28:19.670
So we looked at one specific case where we rotated the dipole and looked at how much energy is required

28:19.670 --> 28:22.410
in order to accomplish that rotation.

28:22.430 --> 28:30.590
The last thing I looked at we looked at placing a dipole in a field that was in homogeneous.

28:30.590 --> 28:31.640
So it wasn't constant

28:36.920 --> 28:40.330
and what we found in that case you could still have a talk

28:43.030 --> 28:48.990
depending on the orientation of the dipole moment with the electric field

28:51.990 --> 28:58.300
and the major difference between that and the constant electric field was now the net force

29:00.930 --> 29:02.570
is non-zero.

29:02.940 --> 29:08.010
So the dipole will not only tend to rotate but it will also tend to accelerate.
