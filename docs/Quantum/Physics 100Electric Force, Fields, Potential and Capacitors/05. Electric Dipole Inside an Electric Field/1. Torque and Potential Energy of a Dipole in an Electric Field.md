### Tóm tắt nội dung

Hi everyone. Today I want to look at another problem in electoral statics. I want to look at a lưỡng cực placed in an điện trường this time. Vậy we're going to get a couple different cases. I'm going to start with the simplest which is just a couple of dye Poles placed in a hằng số điện trường. We're gonna look at the talk on the lưỡng cực. We're going to look at the energy associated with rotating a dye pole in that field and in the second case I want to actually make the field very in space. Vậy we place the lưỡng cực in an in homogeneous điện trường. We're going to see what happens to it. Vậy here are a couple of cases there's lưỡng cực Không one cares lưỡng cực number two. And Bây giờ I'm going to place it in an điện trường one. That's just make the field lines uniform. Vậy I'm not telling you what produces the điện trường I'm just telling you there is one in space and I'm placing lưỡng cực number one at an angle with respect to the điện trường and lưỡng cực number to them and to place it at a different angle. With respect to the điện trường Vậy let's go see what's going to happen to these dye poles. First thing chúng ta có thể look at are the các lực tác dụng lên the individual các điện tích. Không chúng ta có a lưỡng cực Vậy that has a positive điện tích and negative điện tích. Separated by a khoảng cách there will be an lực điện tác dụng lên the positive điện tích and electric các lực in the same hướng as the điện trường. The lực điện tác dụng lên the negative điện tích is going to be in this hướng. The lực điện is in the opposite hướng. The điện trường for negative các điện tích. Well what about this guy. Let's look at lưỡng cực number two. Let's look at all the các lực tác dụng lên lưỡng cực. Number two chúng ta có lực điện tác dụng lên the positive side and chúng ta có a lực tác dụng lên the negative side. Vậy there is a hiệu between both of these pictures Đúng. In case number one you notice that both of these các lực are acting in opposite directions and they're going to tend to make the object rotate like this lưỡng cực will rotate in an điện trường Hello. Case number two case number two simply have các lực that are tending to stretch the lưỡng cực they don't tend to make the object rotate. OK. Vậy when we're going to look at this a little bit more detail in a minute you're going to see that these các lực on a lưỡng cực and this orientation will tạo ra a talk on the lưỡng cực. Whereas if the lưỡng cực is oriented in the hướng of the field or opposite of the field we're going to show that there is Không torque because these các lực don't tend to make the object rotate. Where Trong trường hợp này they do. Vậy let's go to the interactive whiteboard and look at a couple specific examples. OK. Vậy here chúng ta có our lưỡng cực again placed in our field the positive and negative các điện tích are separated by khoảng cách let's call it D. And what I want to do Bây giờ is I want to look at the torque produced by each one of these các lực. Vậy in order to tính toán the the talk I remember that the lực first has a độ lớn of the điện tích times the điện trường. And if we want to look at the torque produced by a hằng số lực remember what that was. It was the khoảng cách to the pivot. Let's put the pivot Đúng at the midpoint. Vậy the khoảng cách to the pivot. Vậy that's where the lực is being applied is deep over to. It's the độ lớn of the lực which is f multiplied Bây giờ times sign of the angle theta. And remember with the angle theta is in this particular case the angle theta is defined as this and that is the torque produced on or by the lực tác dụng lên the positive điện tích. We also have to xem xét the torque produced by the lực down over here on the negative điện tích. That one's going to have the exact same độ lớn. The khoảng cách to the pivot is d over to the độ lớn of the lực is the same because we're looking at a lưỡng cực and the điện tích is the same and sign of the angle theta. Được Vậy we're just about done here and we want to look at the network. Remember this year only gives you the độ lớn. However the hướng is going to be the same for both of them. Let me add the directional were here. If this lực over here on the positive điện tích is the only lực tác dụng lên the system it's going to tend to make it rotate clockwise. How about the negative one. Again if the lực down here is the only lực tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực it's going to also tend to make it rotate clockwise. That's in the same hướng. Therefore both of those vectors are in the same hướng. Vậy the net torque is simply going to be just the tổng of both of those at the end of the day you get to and since they have the exact same độ lớn. I'll go ahead Bây giờ and substitute in the độ lớn of the lực F which is simply the điện tích times the độ lớn of the field time sign of theta. And that's our net torque tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực. I could simplify this a little bit. This too will cancel without one. Let's go ahead and just write our final phương trình for the talk on a lưỡng cực can be written as Q D. E sign of theta Vậy that's kind of a useful công thức here. Remember you can also take this a step further and that's typically what people do is we're going to định nghĩa a quantity and định nghĩa a quantity you call the lưỡng cực moment. And Trong trường hợp này it's the electric lưỡng cực moment the electric lưỡng cực moment. We give it the letter P. It's actually going to be a véctơ and the độ lớn of the véctơ is simply going to be the điện tích of the lưỡng cực. Vậy the điện tích of either the positive or the negative multiplied times the khoảng cách between the two các điện tích and the hướng the convention is it points toward the positive điện tích points toward positive điện tích. OK Vậy in this figure here if I'm going to plot with his véctơ P looks like the véctơ P basically points in this hướng here. That is our lưỡng cực moment associated with that lưỡng cực. And the reason we're gonna want to định nghĩa a lưỡng cực moment is because the talk Bây giờ you can actually write it as a véctơ phương trình. The talk is a véctơ can be written very simply as our lưỡng cực moment véctơ cross tích with the điện trường. Vậy there you have it. That is the same phương trình as the one I wrote up here. Remember how you expand a cross tích is you take the độ lớn of one véctơ multiplied by the độ lớn of the other véctơ and then you multiply by sign of the angle between the two vectors. Vậy in this specific case let me draw the vectors on the side here. Vậy chúng ta có our lưỡng cực moment véctơ which is like this. It has a véctơ P which has a độ lớn of the điện tích. Times the khoảng cách between the two our véctơ E is in this hướng. That's the hướng the điện trường and the angle theta that goes into our talk phương trình is the angle between the lưỡng cực moment véctơ and the điện trường véctơ. Vậy in this hướng here ends up being perpendicular to the lưỡng cực moment véctơ and the điện trường véctơ. If things are in the mặt phẳng like this usually you can pick a hướng for the talk is being either clockwise or counterclockwise and that's kind of what I've done up here. OK Vậy there you have it folks there is the talk of produced by an điện trường on a lưỡng cực Vậy it depends on the angle. chúng ta có our general phương trình here which is P E sign of theta. Vậy chúng ta có a couple specific cases to look at. ví dụ when is the torque a maximum value well for any given lưỡng cực which has a lưỡng cực moment P the maximum angle or the maximum torque will be produced when sign of theta equals the one. When chúng ta có sign of theta equals the one that's going to tạo ra the maximum torque for any given điện trường and lưỡng cực and we get that when the lưỡng cực moment P is perpendicular to the điện trường. Because in that case our angle theta is actually 90 degrees and the torque simply going to be the lưỡng cực moment times the điện trường time sign of 90 which is 1. Vậy that's it. The độ lớn of the talk is simply this. If you want to write it Bây giờ in terms of the điện tích remember you can simply do that with the điện tích. Times the khoảng cách between the positive and negative điện tích. Times the điện trường and that's the độ lớn of the talk. Được Vậy let's compare the two cases I had on a board Bây giờ. Vậy chúng ta có lưỡng cực one which is located in a hằng số điện trường. However it makes an angle of 30 degrees with respect to the điện trường whereas in case number two you have the lưỡng cực that's in the same hướng as the điện trường and in both cases we want to look at the torque tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực. Again chúng ta có thể look at each individual điện tích look at the các lực however I want to use the formulae we had in the previous case which said that the talk is p cross E for both cases. Remember how that véctơ P was defined that was our lưỡng cực moment. The véctơ P was the điện tích q TIMES the khoảng cách between the two các điện tích and the hướng was from the negative to the positive. Negative to positive. Vậy let's draw the vectors P and E for both of these cases for lưỡng cực 1 and lưỡng cực numbe$r^2$. Vậy here's what chúng ta có for lưỡng cực number 1. Here's the véctơ P. Here's our điện trường and I've said that the angle here was 30 degrees Được rồi. Compare that to case number two case number two. Again our lưỡng cực moment véctơ goes from negative to positive. Vậy in that case it's the same độ lớn. However the orientation is different. That's the hướng of P and the hướng of e is also in this hướng. Vậy Trong trường hợp này the angle between them is equal to zero degrees. Vậy if we apply our torque phương trình and we want to find how big the talk is Vậy let's just look at the độ lớn of the torque the độ lớn of the talk or simply BP. E time sign of 30 degrees Vậy that's q TIMES THE khoảng cách BETWEEN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE điện tích. Times the độ lớn of the field and sign of 30 degrees. Vậy one last step. Q d e divided by two. Được rồi compare that to this case the net torque tác dụng lên lưỡng cực number two is simply going to be PS The same is the same. However chúng ta có sign of zero degrees and sign of zero degrees is zero. Therefore the net torque tác dụng lên lưỡng cực number two is zero whereas the net torque for lưỡng cực number one definitely non-zero. Vậy what we're gonna have here is Trong trường hợp này we're going to get some rotation of the lưỡng cực. Trong trường hợp này Không rotation I'm. You look at the thế energy of a dive hole in a field again I'm going to use this definition of our electric lưỡng cực moment which is a véctơ that pointed from the negative điện tích to the positive điện tích and chúng ta có thể write the thế energy of a lưỡng cực in a hằng số điện trường in terms of the điện trường as lưỡng cực moment as p dot e. This is a scalar tích Vậy if you want to write that in terms of the angle between both of those vectors and just in terms of the magnitudes simply minus p e times cos of theta Vậy that's kind of an important phương trình. Vậy again the energy can range over a whole whole series of values because the angle fade I can place this lưỡng cực at any orientation with respect to the điện trường you can look at when the thế energy is a maximum. Vậy when when chúng ta có a maximum value for this thế energy we'd have a maximum value whenever the angle theta is equal to 180 degrees when the angle theta is equal to 180 degrees cos of 1 A.D. minus 1. Vậy the energy of the lưỡng cực in the field is P is you get minus p e times coast of 180 which is minus 1 which cancels with the original one we get a minimum value of the thế energy when the angle theta equal to zero. In that case that's when the lưỡng cực moment is aligned with the điện trường. In that case you have a minimum thế energy and the energy of the lưỡng cực Trong trường hợp này is minus p and there is a case where the thế energy is equal to zero Đúng the thế energy equals to zero when the angle is 90 degrees in that case zero is when our angle theta equals 90 degrees the thế energy of the lưỡng cực is equal to zero. Được. The actual values of thế energy aren't really that interesting. What's more interesting is when you change Được rồi when we change the energy or when we try to rotate the lưỡng cực we might be asked how much work is needed to rotate a lưỡng cực in an điện trường. We know there's các lực that the field produces on the điện tích. Vậy if I wanted to rotate I have to do work on the system. Vậy let's look at this specific case here down at the bottom that I've sketched out. Vậy I have an initial lưỡng cực where the lưỡng cực moment is aligned in the same hướng as my điện trường shown in red and in the final position I simply want to rotate this lưỡng cực by 180 degrees by some mechanism I'm not really showing you but I'm just giving you the initial and the final steps. What the orientation of lưỡng cực looks like in the field and we want to tính toán how much energy is stored in the system or how much work did you have to do to accomplish this. Vậy tính toán how much work you needed to do. You simply have to look at the work needed. Basically just the change in thế energy. If you're not sure about this. Think about just the mass Đúng. If I just have a mass on the ground and I want to lift it up all the way up to here and lift it up through some height if I want to know how much energy is required to do this all you have to do is simply compare the thế energy at the top versus the bottom. Trong trường hợp này you usually set the thế energy equal to zero at the bottom and the thế energy in the final step is simply M.G. H. Vậy the amount of energy required to raise this mass a certain khoảng cách H is simply equal to M.G. H. You look at the change of thế energy in the system. That's exactly what we're going to do here for the lưỡng cực except the thế energy is not simply given by the mass times the gravity times the height above the ground. The thế energy for a lưỡng cực in a field is given by our other expression here which is negative lưỡng cực moment times the điện trường times cos of the angle between both of those vectors. Vậy the work needed is the change in thế energy. That's a final thế energy minus an initial thế energy. Bây giờ those are going to be different from each other because the angle is different in each case. You got to be a little bit careful. Vậy our final value is simply well how did we start we started. Vậy our final value is shown down here and that's the case where the angle is 180 between the lưỡng cực moment and the điện trường. I've actually calculated that one Đúng here. That was the value of the thế energy of the lưỡng cực in the field and Vậy it's simply P minus What's the initial value in the initial configuration the lưỡng cực moment is a line in the same hướng of the field. That is when the angle is zero degrees have shown that one here and the thế energy is negative P. Vậy when you include everything together the work needed it's simply going to be two times the độ lớn of the lưỡng cực moment. Times the độ lớn of the điện trường and that is going to be a quantity that's going to have units of joules corresponds to the amount of energy that's required in order to accomplish this. Notice we're gonna get a positive number. We're gonna get a positive number because chúng ta có to do work against the điện trường in order to rotate this object. It's not going to rotate by itself. You have to put energy into the system. And this is how much energy you need to put in in order to rotate this lưỡng cực. OK. Bây giờ when to look at what happens when the điện trường is not hằng số compared to the hằng số case over here. Bây giờ let's just look at the talk the talk for case number one where the lưỡng cực moment is a line in the same hướng the field we just saw that the net torque was equal to zero. We had các lực acting to the Đúng on the positive điện tích lực acting to the left on the negative điện tích. And those các lực didn't tạo ra any rotation for the case down or illustrated in the bottom figure if the fuel is hằng số. Again we had các lực acting at a certain khoảng cách from the pivot and those các lực produced a torque Đúng they would tend to make the object rotate clockwise clockwise rotation. The độ lớn of the talk was given by our lưỡng cực moment the độ lớn of the điện trường times a sign of the angle between them. If you substituted in our value for the lưỡng cực moment or the độ lớn of the lưỡng cực moment which is simply Q times D sine and theta Vậy that's the talk. One thing I didn't mentioned before however it's very very important when you write this down is the các lực for case number two even for case number one the các lực balance out actually is although they do tạo ra a talk for case number two. The net lực tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực is equal to zero because the điện tích is the same. The điện trường is the same. These các lực are equal in opposite directions. They tạo ra a torque however they don't tạo ra an gia tốc of the lưỡng cực. You'll simply rotate it. You're not going to move the lưỡng cực you're not going to lead to any translational motion of the lưỡng cực. And that's kind of the big important point and the biggest hiệu here between the case where the electric fuel is hằng số versus when the điện trường varies in space. Vậy let's have a look at it. Được Vậy Bây giờ let's compare the case where the key where the điện trường is not uniform in space. For that I'm going to look at the fuel produced by negative điện tích and I'm going to place the lưỡng cực with its lưỡng cực moment aligned pointing toward the negative điện tích and making some angle that is shown in the bottom figure over here. Vậy let's look at the các lực tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực. Well you're gonna have an attractive lực between the positive part of the lưỡng cực and the negative điện tích. Vậy that's going to be a lực pointing to the Đúng and you're also going to have a repulsive lực draw it in a different shade here because these two negatives will đẩy each other. Vậy you're going to have another lực pointing to the left this time. Let's call that f 2 and call our first one EF 1. Bây giờ one thing that is different from the case of the hằng số điện trường is that both of the vectors for the hằng số field both of the lực vectors had the same độ lớn. Trong trường hợp này f 1 in độ lớn is going to be bigger than 2. Therefore there's going to be a net lực tác dụng lên it. The net lực is not equal to zero. Like Trong trường hợp này this net lực tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực was equal to zero. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là when the lưỡng cực is gonna be attracted to the negative điện tích if there's a net lực there's gonna be an gia tốc. How about the torque well even Trong trường hợp này here there is Không torque although there's a net lực tác dụng lên it. The torque tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực is going to be zero and you can see that just by looking at the figure. All of these các lực do as the các lực tend to make the object stretch Đúng. They're acting in opposite directions but there's Không rotation Không rotation Được rồi. Bây giờ take the case Bây giờ where our lưỡng cực moment is again at some angle. With respect to the axis joining the negative điện tích producing another điện trường in this particular case again chúng ta có thể look at the các lực tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực and the các lực. You're gonna have an attractive lực acting this way. And you're going to have again a repulsive lực acting away from it. Bây giờ these vectors have a different directions number one. Vậy you're still going to have a net lực tác dụng lên them. Both of these -- vectors will never cancel out to give you zero net lực because they're in different directions. Vậy we're gonna have a net lực not equal to zero. In addition you're gonna have a net torque. You can tính toán the torque by looking at each individual component and repeating the steps we did for the regular dial and a hằng số field. You can place a pivot here at the center of the lưỡng cực and look at the total torque produced by each lực and then add them up as vectors. Vậy we'd have to do the torque produced by the lực F one as a véctơ plus the torque produced by the lực F 2 is a véctơ. Each one of these cases I can use my phương trình I can use it's the khoảng cách to the pivot. It's the độ lớn of the lực and time sign the angle between them. OK. You'd have to do a little bit more algebra but the key point is that you can have a net lực Trong trường hợp này and you can also have a net torque. This is to actually tính toán the độ lớn is a little bit more complicated however the concepts should be clear just by looking at the lực diagrams Được. Vậy just to summarize the key points we định nghĩa a new véctơ today called the DI Paul moment. lưỡng cực moment we gave it the letter P and the độ lớn anyway it was the điện tích q of the lưỡng cực multiplied times the khoảng cách between the two các điện tích and the hướng was from the negative toward the positive điện tích of the lưỡng cực. This was particularly useful because you can then use the definition of lưỡng cực moment to look at the torque tác dụng lên a lưỡng cực. And the talk is simply written as P cross e and if you write that in terms of the độ lớn of the torque you simply have the độ lớn of the véctơ P the độ lớn of our điện trường and there's also that angular dependence that was really important because there's some orientations in the diaper hole in a field where there is Không torque tác dụng lên it ví dụ if it's parallel or a. parallel. The other important point that was that the net lực of a lưỡng cực in a hằng số điện trường is zero is hằng số because you have bằng nhau và ngược chiều các lực they don't tạo ra a net lực tác dụng lên the lưỡng cực. We also discuss thế energy. And we looked at a case where the lưỡng cực was placed in a hằng số điện trường. In that case the thế energy of the lưỡng cực is simply minus Pitot e. If you expand that scalar tích you simply have pea coat of theta. Bây giờ the actual individual values of the thế energy are really not that interesting. What's more interesting is when you change the thế energy of a lưỡng cực Vậy you either have to do work or điện trường does work work on the lưỡng cực. Vậy we looked at one specific case where we rotated the lưỡng cực and looked at how much energy is required in order to accomplish that rotation. The last thing I looked at we looked at placing a lưỡng cực in a field that was in homogeneous. Vậy it wasn't hằng số and what we found in that case you could still have a talk depending on the orientation of the lưỡng cực moment with the điện trường and the major hiệu between that and the hằng số điện trường was Bây giờ the net lực is non-zero. Vậy the lưỡng cực will not only tend to rotate but it will also tend to accelerate.
