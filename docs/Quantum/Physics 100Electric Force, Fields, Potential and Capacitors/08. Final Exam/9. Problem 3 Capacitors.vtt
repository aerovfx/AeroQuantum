00:00.150 --> 00:06.210
Problem 3 now we have a potential difference of one hundred volts here is applied across two of them

00:06.210 --> 00:08.360
that are in series with each other.

00:08.460 --> 00:08.720
All right.

00:08.730 --> 00:14.220
They give us the capacitance of only see one and they also say we have a voltage across it.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.320
That's seventy five volts.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.700
So first question what's the voltage across the second one.

00:19.730 --> 00:23.180
Okay so imagine I measure the voltage right here.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.780
What value would I get.

00:24.900 --> 00:28.600
Again whatever voltage I have over here one hundred I have to have.

00:28.620 --> 00:35.580
They have to sum to the voltage across both capacitors like this because they're going to be in series.

00:35.580 --> 00:35.850
All right.

00:35.850 --> 00:43.250
So v total that we would kind of write that as an equation has to be the voltage across capacitor C

00:43.250 --> 00:46.560
one plus the voltage across capacitor C two.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.910
So this is one hundred.

00:48.120 --> 00:54.360
And I've given you that V.C. one is is seventy five.

00:54.850 --> 00:58.640
So right here this here has to be seventy five.

00:58.650 --> 01:05.100
So you have to have that the voltage across capacitor C two should be twenty five volts.

01:05.220 --> 01:05.510
OK.

01:05.550 --> 01:08.370
You have to have twenty five volts right here.

01:08.370 --> 01:08.610
All right.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.540
So that's it for that one.

01:09.540 --> 01:10.440
That's pretty straightforward.

01:10.440 --> 01:16.780
Find the capacitance see to it what is this capacitance C2.

01:16.860 --> 01:18.740
Well how do we do this.

01:19.020 --> 01:25.670
If I was gonna write an equation well one capacitor equation I could write is that the charge on capacitor

01:25.670 --> 01:30.640
C two is its capacitance and multiplied by the voltage which I just calculated.

01:31.570 --> 01:31.890
OK.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.780
So if I knew how to calculate the charge then I could easily get to this because I know this is twenty

01:36.780 --> 01:38.200
five volts.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.660
So how do we get the charge.

01:39.660 --> 01:46.440
Well there's one thing to know about capacitors in series is that the charge has to be the same on all

01:46.440 --> 01:47.480
the capacitors.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.350
So what I could do is I could use this in order to find the capacity C2.

01:53.580 --> 01:55.330
So what would be the charge on Q one.

01:55.340 --> 02:01.950
I'd have a same equation here except for Q one so I would have the capacity and C one multiplied by

02:01.950 --> 02:04.550
the voltage across c 1.

02:04.630 --> 02:10.610
And again this here has to be equal to C2 multiplied by the voltage across C two.

02:10.680 --> 02:18.210
So let's just rearrange just to get one final expression for the capacitance C to see one again multiplied

02:18.210 --> 02:21.060
by the ratio of both of these.

02:21.060 --> 02:22.460
So this is easy to evaluate.

02:22.460 --> 02:29.670
I'm just gonna leave this in micro Feride so this is 10 micro Feride and the ratio of the voltages here

02:29.670 --> 02:33.230
I have seventy five and here I have twenty five.

02:34.170 --> 02:41.170
So this here gives me three multiplied by ten so C two has to be thirty micro Feride.

02:41.460 --> 02:44.530
All right so I mean go ahead and write that on the figure over here.

02:44.750 --> 02:45.090
Okay.

02:45.110 --> 02:46.080
So that wasn't too bad.

02:46.560 --> 02:49.570
What's the equivalent capacitance of the system.

02:49.660 --> 02:54.900
So there's kind of two ways to do this one one is to again remember that they are in series and if you

02:54.900 --> 03:01.770
have capacitors in series or the equivalent capacitance is the sum of the reciprocal equals one over

03:01.770 --> 03:04.430
the reciprocal of the equivalent.

03:04.650 --> 03:08.620
It's the opposite when you do circuits with resistors.

03:08.730 --> 03:13.740
So in here again I'm just gonna leave everything in microfiber adds and have one over 10 plus one over

03:13.740 --> 03:14.520
30.

03:14.530 --> 03:15.080
Okay.

03:15.140 --> 03:17.450
And now you've got to do a bit of math over here.

03:17.640 --> 03:22.080
What I'd probably do is put this on a common denominator of 30.

03:22.080 --> 03:29.280
So if I do three over 30 plus one over 30 excuse me for over 30.

03:29.380 --> 03:30.820
OK so see equivalent.

03:30.810 --> 03:35.730
Now just gotta flip that fraction thirty over four.

03:36.190 --> 03:36.520
Okay.

03:36.540 --> 03:41.610
So the equivalent one should be equal to seven point five micro Feride.

03:41.640 --> 03:48.060
Notice that the equivalent is smaller than any one of the capacitors in a circuit.

03:48.780 --> 03:49.290
Okay.

03:49.380 --> 03:54.600
So this is kind of a one way of doing this another way of doing it is again if I replace this with an

03:54.600 --> 04:00.690
equivalent capacitance I'm going to get that the charge is also equal to the charge on the equivalent

04:00.690 --> 04:06.270
capacitance and I know what the charge is I can calculate that pretty easily because I know the capacitance

04:06.270 --> 04:11.580
that I know the voltage so at the end what you could do here is simply use that equation right there

04:12.080 --> 04:18.780
that the equivalent capacitance the charge on it is equal to the capacitance multiplied by the voltage

04:18.780 --> 04:24.570
across the voltage across would be simply a hundred volts.

04:24.780 --> 04:25.030
All right.

04:25.050 --> 04:30.600
So how much charge is on the equivalence I can use any one of those I can use kind of Q One multiplied

04:30.600 --> 04:36.540
by the voltage across it and that's C equivalence multiplied by one hundred.

04:36.540 --> 04:36.860
All right.

04:36.920 --> 04:41.310
So C1 I'm sorry I wrote a mistake over here.

04:41.310 --> 04:45.510
This should be c 1 C1.

04:45.620 --> 04:45.930
Okay.

04:45.960 --> 04:51.500
So again just multiplying that through so we're gonna have 10 micro ad for this.

04:51.500 --> 04:59.880
The voltage across C was seventy five and that equals to the equivalent capacitance multiplied by 100

05:00.740 --> 05:05.660
anyway you could see here at the end we're going to get the same value we're still going to get C equivalent

05:06.170 --> 05:09.730
equals to seven point five micro Feride.

05:10.090 --> 05:10.530
Okay.

05:10.580 --> 05:16.030
So that's kind of a another way of doing it for this problem quickly running out of space here.

05:16.040 --> 05:16.190
Oh.

05:16.210 --> 05:18.960
So how much charges on each capacitance.

05:18.960 --> 05:19.080
No.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.710
This is super easy to calculate.

05:20.800 --> 05:21.140
All right.

05:21.140 --> 05:24.660
Because we've we've used this equation several times.

05:24.860 --> 05:33.360
So let's just go ahead it's the same charge on each capacitor so once we know this again I may as well

05:33.360 --> 05:36.330
just use this one the equivalent multiplied by the voltage.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.770
That's all you need.

05:37.770 --> 05:40.630
It doesn't matter which one you choose.

05:40.710 --> 05:43.610
We have to have the same charge.

05:43.650 --> 05:47.700
For me it's just easier to use the equivalence right now since I just calculate the value.

05:47.700 --> 05:54.240
So the charge is going to be equal to C equivalent multiplied by V across the equivalent capacitor which

05:54.240 --> 05:56.010
is 100 volts.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.980
So this is seven point five.

05:58.980 --> 06:05.900
Now I'm gonna go to Fair Ed so it's negative six Feride and multiplied by a hundred.

06:06.010 --> 06:06.670
Okay.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.330
So at the end I should get 750.

06:10.390 --> 06:14.520
This will be in times 10 to the negative six.

06:14.520 --> 06:17.870
Cool on this is the total charge.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.800
So I'm running out of space here okay.

06:21.830 --> 06:25.580
Anyway that's how you would calculate how much charge there is on the capacitor.

06:25.580 --> 06:28.370
And again it doesn't matter which equation you use over here.

06:28.370 --> 06:34.490
If you use any of the other ones you can use Q1 or Q2 you know the value of the capacitance multiplied

06:34.490 --> 06:35.530
by the voltage across.

06:35.530 --> 06:41.720
You could see that all these products are going to end up giving you a 750 times tend to the negative

06:41.720 --> 06:42.260
six.
