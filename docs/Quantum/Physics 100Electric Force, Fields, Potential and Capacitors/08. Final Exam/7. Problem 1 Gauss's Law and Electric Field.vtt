00:00.120 --> 00:00.410
All right.

00:00.420 --> 00:03.140
So this is what we have here we have a gouges law problem.

00:03.150 --> 00:11.080
Number one we've got a conducting sphere inside which has a radius of zero point zero five meters.

00:11.100 --> 00:17.160
What else is placed inside a shell over here which has an inner radius which is given by that and an

00:17.190 --> 00:18.780
outer radius which is this.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.090
OK.

00:19.110 --> 00:23.740
We're asked now to look at the field at different regions.

00:23.760 --> 00:30.440
Now this inner sphere has a charge of careful here the negative sign is up here both negatively CHARGE

00:30.440 --> 00:32.620
AND NEGATIVE for nano cooling.

00:32.690 --> 00:42.450
So I'm gonna call this Q inner Q In is minus four times 10 to the negative nine columns and on the outer

00:42.450 --> 00:46.910
shell what I have here is positive charge here of three.

00:47.780 --> 00:48.240
OK.

00:48.270 --> 00:54.710
So this is Q Out is three times 10 to the negative nine columns.

00:55.200 --> 00:58.980
OK so we want to find a feel that the various positions over here.

00:58.980 --> 01:00.840
So let me do Part A right here.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.180
Let's figure out where is this.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.970
Oh this so they tell you it's in the air space between them.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.720
So if I was gonna draw a ocean surface it kind of look like something like this.

01:12.920 --> 01:13.160
All right.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.380
And the radius here.

01:14.390 --> 01:20.450
Let's just call it a radius r which is I mean it's gonna give it a subscript a.

01:20.480 --> 01:20.720
All right.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.550
So you apply GAUSS LAW to this problem.

01:22.550 --> 01:28.610
It's pretty straightforward says that the field multiplied by the area of this Goshen surface the area

01:28.610 --> 01:30.880
of a sphere is for pi.

01:30.920 --> 01:34.030
This will be a squared.

01:34.030 --> 01:37.990
And that has to be equal to how much charge is enclosed by this.

01:38.030 --> 01:41.070
Well it's the total charge q in right.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.470
It's simply Q in divided by epsilon 0.

01:45.500 --> 01:45.700
All right.

01:45.710 --> 01:52.130
So if I kind of write the math a little bit differently I'm gonna have one over for Pi Epsilon 0.

01:52.520 --> 01:59.610
And this is going to be Q in and divided by our A squared and that's multiplied.

01:59.960 --> 02:07.140
This guy here everything here in the bracket is typically what we call the constant k so you can write

02:07.140 --> 02:13.260
this as k q in divided by our A squared.

02:13.260 --> 02:19.080
So this looks like the field of a point charge rates as though all of the charge of this inner sphere

02:19.080 --> 02:22.480
is localized right at the center.

02:22.710 --> 02:28.800
So at the end we just substitute the values nine times ten of the nine K value the charge on the Inner

02:28.800 --> 02:38.400
Sphere again I'm just going to write the magnitude is for nano Coolum and now I have to divide by the

02:38.400 --> 02:45.280
right distance the radius is zero point zero five meters eight five meters sorry.

02:45.310 --> 02:51.080
Square put that in the calculator at the end you should get something which is just under 5000.

02:51.490 --> 02:52.720
That's in Newton's preschool home.

02:52.740 --> 02:52.960
OK.

02:52.960 --> 03:02.650
So that's part a part B now have a look where B is the radius is is this however it's inside the metal

03:02.650 --> 03:04.060
shell.

03:04.060 --> 03:09.730
So if you were going to draw that one it would kind of look something like this the radius the ocean

03:09.730 --> 03:17.620
surface would look something like this so this is kind of a trick question if you're inside the metal.

03:17.880 --> 03:18.780
The definition.

03:18.780 --> 03:22.440
This means you're inside a conductor.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.130
And guess what.

03:23.130 --> 03:28.810
The field inside the conductor is always zero.

03:29.030 --> 03:29.420
All right.

03:29.590 --> 03:30.640
So that one's easy.

03:30.700 --> 03:31.980
You don't have anything to do.

03:32.500 --> 03:37.850
And how about the last one C C says outside of the spherical shell.

03:37.930 --> 03:42.250
So if you're going to do outside the spherical shell this is kind of what the ocean's surface would

03:42.250 --> 03:42.760
look like.

03:42.760 --> 03:48.070
So the bigger it's going to have a radius which I'm going to call our subscript C..

03:48.130 --> 03:54.120
Put a little C over here or if you apply Gauss as law to this problem is going to look.

03:54.120 --> 03:59.230
The left hand side is going to look very very similar to the Part A except we have a different radius

04:00.160 --> 04:02.180
r c squared.

04:02.470 --> 04:04.230
And now what do we have instead of the.

04:04.420 --> 04:06.150
Just the charge of the inner.

04:06.220 --> 04:13.230
We really need to know what is the total charging closed and divided by epsilon 0.

04:13.260 --> 04:13.600
OK.

04:13.630 --> 04:15.790
So the only thing that's kind of a little bit tricky.

04:15.800 --> 04:21.250
Let me just rewrite this again it's always gonna be one over for pipes along zero I'm just gonna write

04:21.250 --> 04:29.230
that as K this here becomes Q total divided by our c squared.

04:29.230 --> 04:32.640
So I want you to think about what is the Q total over here.

04:32.830 --> 04:37.300
It's the total charge inside the surface so there's two things.

04:37.300 --> 04:43.530
Q total is going to be Q inside plus the charge on the outside shell.

04:44.190 --> 04:47.020
Okay so I mean kind of write that special right here.

04:47.020 --> 04:53.540
So the total charge is Q In plus Q on the outer shell.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.340
So Q In is negative for nano coolant.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.220
Q Out is three.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.550
So the total charge is minus it's going to be negative.

05:03.550 --> 05:03.910
Right.

05:03.910 --> 05:05.450
And one nano Coolum

05:08.240 --> 05:08.760
all right.

05:08.790 --> 05:09.420
So that's it.

05:09.450 --> 05:11.710
So that's kind of the tricky part over here.

05:11.820 --> 05:16.110
So at the end the field if and if I'm just worried about the magnitude I'm not going to put in the negative

05:16.110 --> 05:16.610
sign here.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.330
But the magnitude of the total charge is 1 nano cool.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.630
So we're gonna have nine times 10 to the 9.

05:24.630 --> 05:30.510
This year is going to be one times ten to the negative nine and divided by now the bigger radius because

05:30.510 --> 05:37.130
my I'm outside and it's zero point two five squared.

05:37.230 --> 05:42.270
Okay I'll put that in the calculator and you should get approximately one hundred and forty four newtons

05:42.270 --> 05:48.300
per kilo get kind of a nice application of Gauss law to different radii.
