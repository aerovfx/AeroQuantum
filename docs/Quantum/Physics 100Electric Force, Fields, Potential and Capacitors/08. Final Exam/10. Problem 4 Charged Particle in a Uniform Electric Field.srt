00:00.450 --> 00:00.690
All right.

00:00.690 --> 00:06.660
Here's the last problem here we have a uniform electric field which exist between two parallel plates.

00:06.660 --> 00:11.970
We have an electron here that's released from arrest from the surface of the negative plate and then

00:11.970 --> 00:19.010
it strikes a positive plate which is a distance of three point six centimeters from the first.

00:19.020 --> 00:21.090
And it gives us how much time it takes.

00:21.390 --> 00:21.730
OK.

00:21.750 --> 00:23.880
So let me go ahead first and just kind of fill this in.

00:23.880 --> 00:32.730
This is zero point zero three six meters and the amount of time it takes delta t is small because it's

00:32.730 --> 00:34.620
a tiny little electron.

00:34.620 --> 00:39.560
So two point zero times ten to the negative eight seconds.

00:39.590 --> 00:40.040
Okay.

00:40.230 --> 00:44.070
For a first question fine the acceleration of the electron.

00:44.100 --> 00:44.350
All right.

00:44.370 --> 00:49.140
So acceleration when I would think about that I would probably think about the word force.

00:49.170 --> 00:49.790
Right.

00:49.830 --> 00:55.170
So I'd say there's probably a force acting on the electron and the force is usually given by the charge

00:55.170 --> 00:57.760
multiplied by the electric field.

00:57.870 --> 01:02.100
And if this is the only force acting on this electron I can go ahead and kind of draw.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.880
Right here there has to be a force acting on it like this.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.090
Right.

01:06.390 --> 01:11.370
If this is the only force that should be equal to the mass times the acceleration.

01:11.400 --> 01:11.670
Oh.

01:11.700 --> 01:15.870
So my acceleration then must be QE over m.

01:15.930 --> 01:19.580
So let's think about this for a minute do I know the charge of the electron Yep.

01:19.650 --> 01:20.880
Do I know the mass.

01:20.940 --> 01:24.720
You might not know the mass but here let me go ahead and give it to you the mass of the electron is

01:25.200 --> 01:30.930
nine point one times 10 to the negative 31 KG something you can look up in a book.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.050
However do I know the electric field.

01:34.350 --> 01:37.730
There's no mention here of the electric field so I'm kind of stuck.

01:37.740 --> 01:42.230
If I if I wrote this down there's nothing wrong with this but I wouldn't be able to take it further.

01:42.270 --> 01:48.300
So one thing I could do now is maybe use some of this information right here because I know it accelerates

01:48.330 --> 01:50.520
because there is an electric field.

01:50.520 --> 01:57.090
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to use some of the Kitimat X in order to analyze this motion.

01:57.090 --> 02:02.400
So one of the kinetic equations says if an object is accelerating and it starts from rest well it could

02:02.400 --> 02:09.040
look something like this plus one half the acceleration multiplied by T.

02:09.060 --> 02:14.360
Now if I start from rest it means that this first term is zero because there's no initial velocity.

02:14.490 --> 02:19.890
So this is another equation that I have at my disposal that lets me solve for acceleration.

02:19.890 --> 02:24.210
So now I have to do a little bit of algebra because I know it goes you know three point six centimeters

02:24.210 --> 02:25.960
in this amount of time.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.600
So right away I should be on the right that the acceleration if I'm a little bit careful two times delta

02:30.600 --> 02:35.450
x divided by T squared and I know everything now in this problem.

02:35.620 --> 02:36.660
So I can write this down.

02:36.660 --> 02:43.620
So two multiplied by zero point zero three six meters I want to have it in s I units at the end and

02:43.620 --> 02:46.200
two times ten to the negative eight.

02:46.230 --> 02:48.700
And you have to square that time.

02:48.870 --> 02:53.130
All right you put that number in the calculate you're going to get a kind of a ginormous number one

02:53.130 --> 02:58.250
point eight times ten to the 14 and that is in meters per second squared.

02:58.680 --> 02:58.980
OK.

02:58.980 --> 03:02.110
So that's kind of my answer for chart choice A.

03:02.210 --> 03:02.670
All right read.

03:02.700 --> 03:03.280
Question B.

03:03.290 --> 03:03.690
Question.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.150
B now says what is the electric field.

03:06.150 --> 03:12.430
Oh well this is now I can go back to this other problem which I was kind of started off with.

03:12.930 --> 03:18.090
All right except now I'm asking for the electric field e so I really want an equation in terms of E

03:18.630 --> 03:24.780
so I can put the charge down here at the bottom so I kind of look like this just rearranging that equation.

03:24.930 --> 03:26.930
And now again I know everything here.

03:26.940 --> 03:32.910
So guess what I can just go ahead and substitute that again nine point one times ten to the negative

03:32.910 --> 03:39.940
thirty one for an electron the acceleration we just calculated one point eight times ten to the 14 a

03:40.040 --> 03:44.550
lot of different orders of magnitude here you have to deal with and the charge of the electron I know

03:44.550 --> 03:51.270
is one point six times tend to the negative 19 this is a good exercise to use your calculator and hopefully

03:51.270 --> 03:51.870
you get it right.

03:51.870 --> 03:58.330
I think I got 1024 and I would write that a nuance for cool on all right.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.310
So this is the question.

04:00.310 --> 04:02.710
B In the last one now find the speed.

04:03.190 --> 04:06.340
OK so how fast is it moving now once it hits the other side.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.460
It started from rest right.

04:08.490 --> 04:13.690
So v zero is equal to zero but it's been accelerating now for a long time.

04:13.720 --> 04:20.260
So for part c again I'm gonna go back to my good old faithful Kitimat ex because I know basically everything

04:20.260 --> 04:21.510
about it.

04:21.640 --> 04:28.340
One other key nomadic equation which you might know is this one the square that gives me the speed.

04:28.570 --> 04:34.260
V not squared plus two times the acceleration multiplied by the displacement.

04:34.940 --> 04:38.160
OK so I guess what I'm gonna do here.

04:38.180 --> 04:39.880
This initial velocity is zero.

04:40.360 --> 04:44.350
So all you have to do here at the end is simply take the square root of both sides and you're gonna

04:44.350 --> 04:47.430
get an expression for the final speed.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.870
All right going to put everything in the calculator again.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.790
Let me make this kind of big so I have to.

04:52.900 --> 05:01.210
This is one point eight times 10 to the 14 the large acceleration and the displacement is zero point

05:01.210 --> 05:02.350
zero three six.

05:02.350 --> 05:05.190
Don't forget to take the square root of this number at the end.

05:05.260 --> 05:09.130
So the final speed of this electron just before it hits the plate.

05:09.160 --> 05:16.130
I think I got three point six times tend to the six and that would be in meters per second.

05:16.260 --> 05:18.790
OK so this is a problem see right here.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.640
All right kind of a nice little cinematics problem just to end the exam.
