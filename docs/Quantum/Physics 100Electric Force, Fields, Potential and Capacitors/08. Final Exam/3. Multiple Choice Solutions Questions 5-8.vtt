00:00.360 --> 00:05.250
All right here we have an electron is initially moving to the right when it enters a uniform field directed

00:05.340 --> 00:06.410
upward as shown.

00:07.260 --> 00:10.540
Which trajectory will the electron follow in the field.

00:10.600 --> 00:11.010
Okay.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.880
Well again let's consider this electric field.

00:13.930 --> 00:18.690
What I like to do when somebody presents me with an electric field like this if it's going up I know

00:18.690 --> 00:24.170
that electric field goes from positive toward negative right.

00:24.240 --> 00:30.840
So then I have an electron while the electron is going to be repelled by all of these negative charges

00:31.230 --> 00:34.290
and it's going to be attracted by each one of those.

00:34.290 --> 00:38.700
So guess what it's going to do it's certainly not going to go up here and it's not going to go straight

00:38.700 --> 00:40.190
it has to go down right.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.410
So Z really has to be the correct answer.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.440
The other way to answer this would be just to consider this right.

00:46.440 --> 00:53.290
Remember the Force is the charge multiplied by the field if since the charge is negative right.

00:53.330 --> 00:56.430
We've got to remember this is an electron here.

00:56.660 --> 01:03.700
If we have an electron with a negative charge it means that the force is always in the opposite direction

01:03.710 --> 01:03.970
right.

01:04.010 --> 01:11.470
So this guy here is up if the charge is negative it means that the force is going to be down.

01:11.550 --> 01:11.840
Okay.

01:11.850 --> 01:16.800
And if you have a downward force going to follow this one it's the only trajectory that's pointing down.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.010
All right.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.720
So these are the correct answer.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.240
Nice and easy one.

01:20.250 --> 01:20.460
All right.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.060
Here we have number six.

01:22.050 --> 01:24.450
The figure shows two unequal charges.

01:24.450 --> 01:24.680
OK.

01:24.690 --> 01:29.090
We have positive and we have a negative over here.

01:29.550 --> 01:34.470
The charge this guy here is greater magnitude than the positive charge.

01:34.530 --> 01:36.120
That's why it's kind of bigger here.

01:36.240 --> 01:43.140
Point X is midway between the charges in what section will there be a point where the resulting electric

01:43.140 --> 01:47.680
field in this case the left field e is going to be zero.

01:47.790 --> 01:48.120
Okay.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.850
Well let's consider each one separately.

01:50.850 --> 01:54.990
All right let's make this one red and make this one blue in the total electric field is you have to

01:54.990 --> 02:00.780
add them as vectors so let's draw the field everywhere so let's draw the first the electric field produced

02:00.780 --> 02:04.080
by this positive charge it should point away from it.

02:04.110 --> 02:04.410
Right.

02:04.410 --> 02:11.280
So in all of these different sections over here as I get farther away the fields should be getting smaller.

02:11.850 --> 02:18.870
The field is closest when the field is bigger when I am close to the charge here it's getting smaller

02:18.870 --> 02:20.130
and here it's getting smaller.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.920
That's the field produced by the positive charge.

02:22.920 --> 02:26.490
What about the negative one the field produced by the negative should point toward it.

02:26.760 --> 02:27.150
OK.

02:27.180 --> 02:31.710
So here it should be pretty big should be pretty big when I'm close to it.

02:31.710 --> 02:36.900
And then as I get farther away should start getting smaller OK.

02:36.900 --> 02:37.750
Something like this.

02:37.750 --> 02:41.070
This is the field produced by this negative charge.

02:41.070 --> 02:47.620
So one thing we notice here is that between both of them we have both electric fields that add up in

02:47.620 --> 02:49.360
the same direction.

02:49.690 --> 02:49.900
Right.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.970
So you're always going to have a net electric field here for both of those choices.

02:53.970 --> 02:59.310
So we definitely can't be w x or x y can't be w x or x y.

02:59.340 --> 03:05.630
So we're left with kind of two places it's either going to be somewhere along this section y z or a

03:05.630 --> 03:06.670
long VW.

03:07.090 --> 03:07.350
All right.

03:07.570 --> 03:10.690
So now what you have to do is you have to look at the magnitude.

03:10.960 --> 03:16.210
The key to this problem is that this one is always going to be a bigger electric field especially in

03:16.210 --> 03:24.460
this section over here right in this section the blue line is always going to be bigger because guess

03:24.460 --> 03:24.760
what.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.130
It's closer.

03:26.200 --> 03:26.890
All right.

03:26.890 --> 03:31.600
So you're always going to have this one that the field produced by the negative Q is always going to

03:31.600 --> 03:32.980
be bigger than not one.

03:33.010 --> 03:38.050
So the net in this section although it's going to be smaller it's always going to be pointing to the

03:38.050 --> 03:40.870
left toward the negative charge.

03:40.870 --> 03:45.690
It's really only in this section over here where you could have cancellation.

03:45.690 --> 03:53.280
All right fields are going to cancel out here because again you're closer to the small positive charge.

03:53.290 --> 03:58.210
So that produces a field and you end up being farther from the negative.

03:58.210 --> 04:00.180
However that charge is bigger.

04:00.180 --> 04:00.340
Right.

04:00.340 --> 04:06.760
If you remember the field produced by this guy here again just the magnitude would be k uppercase Q

04:07.120 --> 04:09.390
divided by our squared.

04:09.430 --> 04:16.180
So although this is bigger this guy here is also bigger.

04:16.180 --> 04:19.870
So there is the possibility that you could cancel out the electric field.

04:19.870 --> 04:23.200
It'll be somewhere in this space right here right.

04:24.190 --> 04:28.890
So they're really the only correct answer has to be this VW segment.

04:30.290 --> 04:30.540
All right.

04:30.710 --> 04:36.540
So hopefully you understand that all right problem seven looks like this the figure here shows electric

04:36.540 --> 04:43.860
field lines produced by two small charges p and q consider the following statements The first statement

04:43.860 --> 04:51.630
says the charge on P is smaller than the charge on Q and the second statement says the electrostatic

04:51.630 --> 04:58.980
force on P is smaller than the electrostatic force on Q All right which of the above statements are

04:58.980 --> 04:59.880
true.

05:00.650 --> 05:01.130
OK.

05:01.170 --> 05:06.110
So is the first one true and how would we argue it is the charge on P smaller.

05:06.120 --> 05:12.600
So first of all they're both positive right they're both positive and how do I know that I know that

05:12.630 --> 05:17.190
because the field lines point away from both of those charges.

05:17.220 --> 05:20.440
So that is really how I know they're both positive.

05:20.550 --> 05:27.150
Let me write that down field lines point away all right.

05:27.840 --> 05:33.900
So the next scene how do I know which one is bigger and which one is smaller is p smaller.

05:33.930 --> 05:34.550
Yes.

05:34.580 --> 05:43.560
So the charge on P I mean just charge and call it Kewpie has to be smaller than the charge on Q and

05:43.560 --> 05:52.680
how do I know that there are fewer field lines fewer field lines indicate that the charge is going to

05:52.680 --> 05:54.790
be smaller on that one.

05:54.790 --> 06:00.270
OK if I have a lot of field lines it tells me that the magnitude of the electric field in this region

06:00.300 --> 06:06.510
is big compared to the electric field in this region because I have more field lines going through it.

06:06.510 --> 06:09.950
So definitely the first one is true.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.690
All right how about the second statement.

06:11.790 --> 06:15.390
The electrostatic force on P is smaller.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.650
Well what do we know about the force.

06:16.650 --> 06:19.480
The force is given by cool arms law.

06:19.530 --> 06:24.840
We know there's going to be a force acting like this and there's going to be an equal and opposite force

06:24.870 --> 06:25.100
right.

06:25.110 --> 06:32.730
When you write the force it's only one right it'll be the charge on P it be the charge on Q and divided

06:32.730 --> 06:35.580
by the distance squared but that's it.

06:35.580 --> 06:38.010
That means on this guy there is a force acting like this.

06:38.010 --> 06:40.220
And on this guy there's a force acting like this.

06:40.290 --> 06:42.970
These forces are equal and opposite.

06:43.020 --> 06:48.240
Okay so this one here is actually false.

06:48.690 --> 06:51.480
So really it's only the first statement that is true.

06:51.480 --> 06:54.110
So for this one A is the correct answer.

06:56.220 --> 07:02.580
Problem 8 we say a solid aluminum cube rests on a wooden table in a region where there is a uniform

07:02.580 --> 07:05.520
electric feel and it's directed straight upward.

07:05.520 --> 07:05.880
All right.

07:06.090 --> 07:09.420
What can we say concerning the charges on the top surface of the Cube.

07:09.590 --> 07:09.870
Okay.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.420
Kind of a good problem.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.110
Here we go here's our table.

07:13.230 --> 07:15.480
Let me draw this cube over here.

07:15.750 --> 07:16.470
Let's draw.

07:16.500 --> 07:20.490
Maybe this color okay.

07:20.530 --> 07:21.820
And it's a conductor right.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.610
Because we know it's aluminum.

07:25.290 --> 07:26.190
What else.

07:26.190 --> 07:28.790
Oh there's an electric field that's directed straight up.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.830
So the electric field is produced by something else.

07:31.830 --> 07:37.720
Let me just draw it straight up that's the electric field.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.710
Now again they're asking what's going on with the top surface here.

07:41.740 --> 07:43.900
So what's gonna happen here to the top surface.

07:44.830 --> 07:51.010
Well what happens to the free electrons of this cube where are they going to go again you what you could

07:51.010 --> 07:55.840
do is you could picture what produces this kind of electric field it's something that would be positively

07:55.840 --> 08:04.700
charged down here and maybe some negative charges somewhere up here so the electrons that are on this

08:04.700 --> 08:10.830
piece of aluminum the free ones any way they want to go toward the positive ones right.

08:10.850 --> 08:18.320
So that will leave that the top surface has to be positively charged because the electrons of this aluminum

08:18.320 --> 08:20.280
are gonna go in the down on the bottom surface.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.080
So the top surface at the end has to be positively charged.

08:24.370 --> 08:24.660
Okay.

08:24.710 --> 08:29.450
So for number eight really the top surfaces positively charge.

08:29.450 --> 08:30.530
That's choice a.
