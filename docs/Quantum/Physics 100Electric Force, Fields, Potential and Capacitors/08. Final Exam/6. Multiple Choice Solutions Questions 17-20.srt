WEBVTT

00:00.270 --> 00:05.970
We have two three micro cooling charges they lie on the x axis ones at the origin the others at the

00:05.970 --> 00:07.260
2 meter mark.

00:07.350 --> 00:12.420
What is the potential due to these charges at a point six meters from the axis.

00:12.420 --> 00:15.570
Well I suggest we kind of draw something here going on.

00:15.570 --> 00:20.760
So let me draw the origin right here and we have another one that is two meters away.

00:21.390 --> 00:25.320
Let me draw those charges so too so they both have the same charge.

00:25.320 --> 00:25.490
Right.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.840
So one of them is here.

00:27.840 --> 00:30.240
That's three micro cooling.

00:30.510 --> 00:34.080
And the other one is here and it's also three micro Coolum.

00:34.140 --> 00:36.990
And now we want to go six meters away.

00:37.290 --> 00:40.800
So the point is really somewhere down over here.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.070
Right.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.330
So the point is here.

00:42.330 --> 00:49.270
So it's it's four meters away from this guy and it's going to be six meters away from this guy.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.110
OK.

00:51.140 --> 00:54.390
And what we're looking for here is what is the potential.

00:54.430 --> 01:00.520
So we have two point charges which you have to do is find the total potential.

01:00.520 --> 01:07.410
So it's going to be the potential due to let's call this Q one charge number one to call this one Q2

01:07.420 --> 01:10.360
again of the same magnitude but they're different distances.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.140
So it's the potential due to one plus the potential due to the other.

01:14.140 --> 01:16.480
Now we just use our equation for point charges.

01:16.480 --> 01:27.850
So it's K again Q And now divided by the distance for Q1 I'm going to call this R one plus K Q2 divided

01:27.850 --> 01:28.750
by R2.

01:28.830 --> 01:32.470
Let's go ahead and substitute everything in here first and foremost.

01:32.470 --> 01:37.160
This numerator is going to be the same for both because we have the same charge right.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.750
So really you could factor that out.

01:38.770 --> 01:46.890
You could write k q and now just have the distances here are one plus one over R2.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.350
All right now I'm in a better position to substitute the numbers.

01:50.350 --> 01:54.930
So the total potential now would be k is nine times 10 to the nine.

01:56.170 --> 02:01.290
Let's fix that the charges three micro times 10 to the negative six.

02:01.290 --> 02:01.920
OK.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.460
And then we have this term here.

02:03.460 --> 02:09.440
So it's one over six meters plus one over four meters.

02:09.440 --> 02:09.690
OK.

02:09.700 --> 02:13.270
I think if you put everything on the calculator be a little bit careful when you do that you should

02:13.270 --> 02:17.180
get eleven thousand volts.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.420
All right so choice a is the right answer again just using superposition if you have more than one point

02:22.420 --> 02:28.960
charge you add the potential due to each one the problem 18 in a region where the electric field is

02:28.960 --> 02:37.420
uniform and points in the positive x direction the electrical potential is negative two thousand volts

02:37.420 --> 02:43.480
at X equals the eight and plus 400 volts at X equals to two meters.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.330
What's the magnitude of the field.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.810
Again I would kind of like to draw this one.

02:47.870 --> 02:59.080
So let's just kind of make a line here at X equals to 2 and the voltage over here is 400 volts and then

02:59.080 --> 03:03.130
we have a line at X equals to eight meters.

03:04.060 --> 03:11.890
X equals the eight meters and the voltage over here is negative two thousand volts.

03:12.570 --> 03:13.030
Okay.

03:13.150 --> 03:18.610
So the electric field is uniform and points in the positive x direction where you would plot the electric

03:18.610 --> 03:21.360
field here would be something like this

03:25.550 --> 03:29.750
all right it's kind of like a parallel plate capacitor right where this plate is positive.

03:29.750 --> 03:30.920
This plate here is negative.

03:30.950 --> 03:33.440
Then we have an electric field like this.

03:33.440 --> 03:41.090
So what is just the magnitude of e again the equation that we have over here is that the change in voltage

03:41.510 --> 03:49.610
is equal to negative e multiplied by Delta X that the voltage varies linearly from one plate to the

03:49.610 --> 03:59.100
other see the voltage is getting smaller as I go in the positive x displacement here over six meters.

03:59.330 --> 03:59.540
All right.

03:59.870 --> 04:07.100
So again this is a final value minus an initial value equals to minus E..

04:07.100 --> 04:10.050
And again this is X final minus X initial.

04:10.670 --> 04:17.110
So imagine here this is my initial and this is my final.

04:17.310 --> 04:19.150
Again we're just worried about the magnitude here.

04:19.160 --> 04:20.200
But let's look at this side.

04:20.200 --> 04:20.860
What we get.

04:23.090 --> 04:23.270
All right.

04:23.270 --> 04:31.670
The final voltage here is negative two thousand minus the initial voltage which is 400 equals to negative

04:31.700 --> 04:36.150
e and the final position is eight and minus two.

04:37.440 --> 04:37.700
OK.

04:37.730 --> 04:44.630
So we get minus twenty four hundred is the difference in the voltage and you get minus E multiplied

04:44.630 --> 04:46.670
by six.

04:46.810 --> 04:47.170
OK.

04:47.180 --> 04:52.680
So we could do one last step that the voltage here can get rid of those negative signs.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.100
It's going to be equal to twenty four hundred divided by six.

04:58.200 --> 04:58.450
OK.

04:58.480 --> 05:03.820
So the final answer here at the end should be equal to 400 volts per meter.

05:04.010 --> 05:08.370
The fact that it's positive means that it's pointing in this direction over here.

05:08.420 --> 05:13.100
Again if we're just worried about the magnitude it could have done this a little bit quicker but just

05:13.130 --> 05:14.980
show you how to use that equation right there.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.230
So C is the correct answer for this one

05:20.130 --> 05:28.800
problem 19 now the equal potential surfaces of two point charges are shown find the value of the potential

05:28.800 --> 05:32.770
market on the line for each surface.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.760
Oh the values are listed over here for each surface.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.150
What is the potential difference V G minus VDI.

05:40.020 --> 05:40.350
All right.

05:40.380 --> 05:42.060
So let's go look where we are.

05:42.090 --> 05:46.070
So G is over here and D is right here.

05:46.140 --> 05:49.650
This is easy all you have to do is just simply substitute the values.

05:49.650 --> 05:50.410
Right.

05:50.460 --> 05:56.470
So V G minus V D is the potential on this equity potential.

05:56.490 --> 06:00.350
So I just read it could be anywhere on this point right here.

06:00.570 --> 06:06.840
This is negative 160 and minus well v DVD is zero.

06:06.930 --> 06:12.270
So I get negative 160 volts OK.

06:12.450 --> 06:13.360
Pretty straightforward.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.810
You just reading the values off the chart right there.

06:15.840 --> 06:19.940
So A's the correct answer.

06:20.020 --> 06:20.290
All right.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.350
So here is our final multiple choice problem.

06:23.350 --> 06:28.600
We have a potential difference between plates in an airfield parallel plate capacitor.

06:28.810 --> 06:33.490
The separation is six and the voltage difference is 60 volts.

06:33.520 --> 06:37.860
What's the strength of the magnitude of the electric field between those plates.

06:37.870 --> 06:38.110
All right.

06:38.140 --> 06:39.400
Well this is kind of straightforward.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.250
I think you just draw some parallel plates.

06:42.250 --> 06:48.870
Again we know the separation is six centimeters so just be careful and are right that in meters 0 6

06:48.880 --> 06:54.190
meters and the voltage here between those plates is 60 volts.

06:54.220 --> 06:54.510
All right.

06:54.520 --> 06:55.630
So that's it.

06:55.630 --> 07:00.010
All we have to do is find what is the electric field here between these plates.

07:00.010 --> 07:06.540
Again the electric field is the change of the potential with distance.

07:06.590 --> 07:07.210
OK.

07:07.270 --> 07:11.060
And we're going over a distance of zero point zero six.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.610
Again I don't have to worry about this negative side I'm not worried about the direction here.

07:14.620 --> 07:16.390
I just want to know the magnitude.

07:16.420 --> 07:20.580
So this here is 60 volts divided by zero point zero six.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.270
Well I can even do that math in my head.

07:22.270 --> 07:24.720
This is six over a hundred.

07:24.750 --> 07:31.210
Me bring one hundred over here left with one ten times 100 is a thousand.

07:31.210 --> 07:33.160
A thousand volts per meter.

07:33.240 --> 07:33.460
OK.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.850
That is the strength of the electric field.

07:35.890 --> 07:39.550
So for this one the correct answer is C hopefully you got that one.
