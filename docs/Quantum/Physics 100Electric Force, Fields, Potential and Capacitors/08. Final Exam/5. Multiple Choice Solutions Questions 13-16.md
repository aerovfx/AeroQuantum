### Tóm tắt nội dung

Let's have a look at problem 13 to ideal parallel play capacitors are identical except one has twice the area of the other. If the smaller tụ điện has a điện dung labeled as C the larger one has điện dung. OK. Vậy this is kind of the large versus the small. And again these plates are separated by a certain khoảng cách. Let's just assume they're just air filled. Again the điện dung of the smaller one would write it maybe as this if you remember the parallel plate tụ điện it's a primitive city of free space multiplied by the area of the plate and divided by the khoảng cách. Vậy Trong trường hợp này it would be the area of this plate Đúng here. Bây giờ what we've just said is that the area of this guy is two times whatever the area of that one is. But the spacing is the same. Vậy Đúng the tụ điện of the large plate would be Epsilon 0. The area is two times a and divided by the khoảng cách. Vậy all of this I can take the two out and everything that's left over. Well if you look at everything here in the bracket this looks identical to the điện dung of the small. And that makes sense Đúng. If you have larger plates it means you can put more điện tích on it. Được. And you're gonna have twice as much capacity. Vậy the correct answer for this one is C.. Pretty straightforward. Number 14 when two or more various capacitors are connected in parallel to each other you just highlight that across one battery which are the following statements must be true. And again we could have more than one correct answer. I would do as I would probably just draw a diagram draw a battery and let's draw some capacitors. And we'd only have to put two to two or more but let's just this one here is điện dung C1 and this one here is điện dung C2. Được rồi. The thế hiệu across each tụ điện is the same. Yeah I imagine this is like a 12 volt battery. điều đó có nghĩa là that this is a parallel circuit Đúng. Vậy it means that the hiệu điện thế across a points A and B must also be 12 Vôn. You're going to have 12 Vôn across each one. xem xét point C and D over here. I'm also going to measure 12 Vôn. It has to be equal to the hiệu điện thế of the battery. Vậy this one here is true. Each tụ điện carries the same amount of điện tích. Well let's think about it from and how much điện tích do I have on tụ điện C one. Well if I remember my phương trình it's the điện tích is equal to the điện dung multiplied by the hiệu điện thế across which you just said is going to be the same. I was going to call it V which is the hiệu điện thế of the battery 12 Vôn the điện tích on tụ điện C2 would be well C two multiplied by the hiệu điện thế across. Bây giờ the hiệu điện thế is the same but the điện dung might not be the same. They're not necessarily identical to each other Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that each tụ điện might not have the same amount of điện tích Đúng if this value C one is different from C two that's it. You have different amount of điện tích the equivalent điện dung of this combination is less than the điện dung of any one. Well again Bây giờ the rule for parallel capacitors is the equivalent one is equal to see one plus C two make it different from the resistor equivalent resistance công thức. OK. It's actually the opposite. Được Vậy actually Trong trường hợp này here if I have two of them in parallel the equivalent I can replace that by one equivalent tụ điện which ends up being bigger. It acts like a bigger tụ điện and the value here is equivalent. Vậy it's not going to be less. That's kind of the problem with that. Vậy that was false. What's this. The tụ điện with the largest điện dung has the largest thế hiệu across it. Oh Không. Because we just said it's going to be the same for each one. The hiệu điện thế is going to be the same it doesn't matter on the value of c be a little bit careful that one and the last one choice e the tụ điện with the largest điện dung has the most điện tích. Oh yeah. We just argued here from our using our điện tích phương trình. Vậy this one is also true. Vậy chúng ta có two correct choices there choice and choice. You're both correct. Here's problem 15 chúng ta có a tiny particle that has this độ lớn it's initially moving at 55 meters per second. It's then accelerated through a thế hiệu of 500 Vôn. How much động năng does this particle gain during this period of gia tốc. Được rồi well I would kind of draw it. I think Vậy. Whatever the hiệu điện thế is the only thing I know is that there is a hiệu of hiệu điện thế which is equal to 500 Vôn. Vậy what else do we know. chúng ta có a tiny particle here that is plus five micro cool and initially has some speeds. I don't know let's just kind of have it over here and it's emotionally moving like this at fifty five meters per second. The độ lớn of the điện tích q is five times 10 to the negative 6 micro Coolum. Được rồi let me just for just her. This problem here I imagine this guy here was going to be plus 250 then this guy was gonna be minus 250 Vôn Được rồi just for a comparison here. Vậy what's going to happen while there is AK an điện trường here and a positive điện tích wants to get away from this one and wants to go toward this one. Đúng. Vậy there is a lực tác dụng lên it. However we want to know how much động năng does it gain. Vậy it has some initial động năng here but the question is asking for what is the change of động năng. Được rồi there's going to be a change of động năng because there's going to be a change of thế energy. Đúng here there's a lot of thế energy Đúng here there is less thế energy Vậy that's why there is this change Vậy the total energy has to be conserved. If you think about it here chúng ta có some initial động năng plus some initial thế energy and this here's the final position Vậy we're gonna have some final plus some final. What we're looking for is the change. OK. Vậy again all of this here has to be the same. Vậy let me do all the math over here. Vậy chúng ta có our initial plus my initial has to be my final plus my final. Được rồi let's group together the kinetic energies I'll put them all on the Đúng hand side here. Vậy this is K final minus K initial Vậy this is really the change of động năng. This is really what we're looking for that's going to be how much it's going to gain. Vậy this is going to be you initial minus you final. OK. Bây giờ if you think about this expression here we want to write the change. This is negative the change in terms of the hiệu điện thế but at any point I could write down just clean this up for a second here. At any point what I could do is I can write down the thế energy in terms of the thế Đúng. Vậy the thế energy initial will be the initial or the điện tích multiplied by the initial hiệu điện thế minus the final thế energy is that điện tích q multiplied by the final hiệu điện thế. And this here's the change of động năng at the end here if you can factor this out what you're going to end up getting Đúng here is v initial minus V final equals to my change of động năng. And here this is exactly what chúng ta cần Đúng because this here is simply going to be the 250 minus the 250. OK. This guy Đúng here in the bracket has to be five hundred Vôn. This guy here is my 5 micro cool. That's the điện tích. Vậy at the end you end up getting that the change of động năng is the điện tích five times ten to the negative six multiplied by again this change of hiệu điện thế which is five hundred Vôn. Được rồi if you multiply that out at the end you should get this answer Đúng here choice B OK it would be the correct answer this problem's probably a little bit harder for you but hopefully you were able to kind of argue like this. Use bảo toàn năng lượng again because we're looking for the động năng here here's problem 16 says how much work must we do on an electron to move it from this initial position to the final position along this semi circular path. Assume that the system is isolated from anything else and here chúng ta có the numerical value Vậy it looks like chúng ta có to do a calculation the first thing to notice about this one is it doesn't matter on the path Đúng. We talked about this in the class this is path independent Vậy it really only matters where you start and where you finish Vậy you start here and we're going to finish down over here. Vậy that's all that matters. I could take it along any path I want. It really doesn't matter can take it around here and end it over there. OK Vậy the path doesn't matter. Vậy Bây giờ we want to tính toán the work done by a person or someone who's going to move the electron the electrons are actually quite happy to be here. Let me draw the electron Đúng here and here's a negative điện tích one point six 10 of the negative 19 Đúng. It's very happy to be close to this positive điện tích Đúng here. This is a positive điện tích and this is a negative điện tích. If you think about the các lực involved Đúng when the electron is kind of say midway I just draw Đúng here again it doesn't matter on the path. Vậy when it's Đúng here. Well somebody has to apply a lực like this. This is my applied lực because there is a lực điện acting opposite of that Đúng. The electron wants to go this way. Được rồi. This is the cool Ohm's Law lực. This is the lực điện tác dụng lên the electron. Vậy if you remember the work of phương trình the work done by the điện trường guy. This is điện trường. This is very easy to tính toán because it's a conservative lực. It's equal to negative the change in thế energy. Vậy let's go ahead and do this. Vậy this is negative. Bây giờ we know the thế where we start and where we finished. Vậy you can always write this is negative Q multiplied by the change in hiệu điện thế. Vậy this is minus Q And this is v final minus V initial. Được. This is really just a matter of plugging everything in. Vậy chúng ta có minus what is the điện tích of the electron Bây giờ what's negative one point six times ten to the negative 19. And what is the change of hiệu điện thế while v final here is minus 50. You gotta be careful with all these negative signs and minus V initial the initial is 50. Được rồi. Vậy you get a think about all the negative signs here you get actually three negative signs here you're gonna get negative one hundred for everything here in the bracket. The second bracket that's negative one hundred Vôn and both of those at the end the final answer you'll get is going to be negative and this is one point six times 10 to the negative 17 and this is measured in Joules Vậy this is the work done by the điện trường Vậy first of all we notice that it is negative. And the reason that it's negative again if you xem xét an electron moving from this position to that one the lực điện is acting to the left. But what is the hướng of the độ dời. My net độ dời is that way Đúng. And the lực the lực điện anyway is this way. Vậy that's why we get a negative value for the work done by the field. Bây giờ the work done by me. That's what we're asking for Đúng here. The work done by this applied lực is always going to be opposite of the work done by the lực điện. Vậy Trong trường hợp này really chúng ta có to do positive work of one point six times ten to the negative seven seventeen not nineteen seventeen jewels joules again my work is going to be positive even if you go along the circular path because the các lực that I'm applying is going to be like this and the độ dời is also along the same hướng. Vậy when you have a lực in a độ dời that are in the same hướng what you end up getting is positive work. And again I do positive work because I'm storing I'm putting energy into the system. The electron doesn't want to do like this. Đúng. I am storing thế energy into the system ví dụ if I let that electron go once I'm over here it's going to shoot back on the other side. That's because I've put a lot of thế energy into the system by doing some work. Được rồi. Vậy all of that to say that B is the correct answer. You've got to be careful with the signs here.
