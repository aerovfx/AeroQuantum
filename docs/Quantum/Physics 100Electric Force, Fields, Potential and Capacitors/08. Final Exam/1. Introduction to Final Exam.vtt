Hi everybody.

00:01.470 --> 00:06.930
It's now time for the final exam on this entire chapter here on this entire class.

00:06.930 --> 00:10.920
So it focuses just about on everything that we learned in this class.

00:10.920 --> 00:15.840
Again there are some topics such as GAUSS LAW which you may not cover in your classes you just feel

00:15.840 --> 00:17.020
free to skip those.

00:17.100 --> 00:23.260
The exam is broken down into two sections the first section is the multiple choice problems.

00:23.280 --> 00:29.610
OK so there's 20 multiple choice in some of the questions it'll say there may be more than one correct

00:29.610 --> 00:29.970
choice.

00:29.970 --> 00:33.250
So in those ones there's probably at least two that are correct.

00:33.540 --> 00:37.530
In all the other ones if those words are not said that means there's only one correct choice.

00:37.530 --> 00:37.740
All right.

00:37.740 --> 00:41.710
So have a look at them try the problems for yourself and come watch the solutions.

00:42.060 --> 00:46.200
And the second part there is four problems for you to work on.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.180
Again this will involve a little bit more math.

00:48.180 --> 00:55.230
There might be shorter questions within each problem or different parts to each problem.

00:55.530 --> 01:00.360
But again have a look at those try to work them off by herself and then watch the video solutions and

01:00.360 --> 01:02.490
see if you've got it right or not.

01:02.490 --> 01:03.990
All right good luck everybody.

01:03.990 --> 01:04.870
This is a problem.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.090
Sorry.

01:05.100 --> 01:10.680
This is an exam I actually gave to my physics class in the fall of 2020 semester at the college where

01:10.680 --> 01:11.310
I teach.

01:11.370 --> 01:11.640
OK.

01:11.670 --> 01:13.850
So it's a hard exam.

01:13.860 --> 01:16.960
Students didn't find it easy so if you don't find it it's OK.

01:16.970 --> 01:20.940
I just learned from it and apply what you've learned in this class.

01:20.940 --> 01:21.330
Good luck.
