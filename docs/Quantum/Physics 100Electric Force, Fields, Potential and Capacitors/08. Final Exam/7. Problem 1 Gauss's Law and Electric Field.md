# Problem 1 Gauss's Law and Electric Field

## 08. Final Exam

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi. Vậy this is what chúng ta có here chúng ta có a gouges law problem. Number one we've got a conducting hình cầu inside which has a radius of zero point zero five meters. What else is placed inside a shell over here which has an inner radius which is given by that and an outer radius which is this. OK. We're asked Bây giờ to look at the field at different regions. Bây giờ this inner hình cầu has a điện tích of careful here the negative sign is up here both negatively điện tích AND NEGATIVE for nano cooling. Vậy I'm gonna call this Q inner Q In is minus four times 10 to the negative nine columns and on the outer shell what I have here is positive điện tích here of three. OK. Vậy this is Q Out is three times 10 to the negative nine columns. OK Vậy we want to find a feel that the various positions over here. Vậy let me do Part A Đúng here. Let's figure out where is this. Oh this Vậy they tell you it's in the air space between them. Vậy if I was gonna draw a ocean mặt it kind of look like something like this. Được rồi. And the radius here. Let's just call it a radius r which is I mean it's gonna give it a subscript a. Được rồi. Vậy you apply GAUSS LAW to this problem. It's pretty straightforward says that the field multiplied by the area of this Goshen mặt the area of a hình cầu is for pi. This will be a bình phương. And that has to be equal to how much điện tích is enclosed by this. Well it's the total điện tích q in Đúng. It's simply Q in divided by epsilon 0. Được rồi. Vậy if I kind of write the math a little bit differently I'm gonna have one over for Pi Epsilon 0. And this is going to be Q in and divided by our A bình phương and that's multiplied. This guy here everything here in the bracket is typically what we call the hằng số k Vậy you can write this as k q in divided by our A bình phương. Vậy this looks like the field of a point điện tích rates as though all of the điện tích of this inner hình cầu is localized Đúng at the center. Vậy at the end we just substitute the values nine times ten of the nine K value the điện tích on the Inner hình cầu again I'm just going to write the độ lớn is for nano Coolum and Bây giờ I have to divide by the Đúng khoảng cách the radius is zero point zero five meters eight five meters sorry. Square put that in the calculator at the end you should get something which is just under 5000. That's in Newton's preschool home. OK. Vậy that's part a part B Bây giờ have a look where B is the radius is is this however it's inside the metal shell. Vậy if you were going to draw that one it would kind of look something like this the radius the ocean mặt would look something like this Vậy this is kind of a trick question if you're inside the metal. The definition. This means you're inside a chất dẫn điện. And guess what. The field inside the chất dẫn điện is always zero. Được rồi. Vậy that one's easy. You don't have anything to do. And how about the last one C C says outside of the spherical shell. Vậy if you're going to do outside the spherical shell this is kind of what the ocean's mặt would look like. Vậy the bigger it's going to have a radius which I'm going to call our subscript C.. Put a little C over here or if you apply Gauss as law to this problem is going to look. The left hand side is going to look very very similar to the Part A except chúng ta có a different radius r c bình phương. And Bây giờ what do chúng ta có instead of the. Just the điện tích of the inner. We really need to know what is the total charging closed and divided by epsilon 0. OK. Vậy the only thing that's kind of a little bit tricky. Let me just rewrite this again it's always gonna be one over for pipes along zero I'm just gonna write that as K this here becomes Q total divided by our c bình phương. Vậy I want you to think about what is the Q total over here. It's the total điện tích inside the mặt Vậy there's two things. Q total is going to be Q inside plus the điện tích on the outside shell. Được Vậy I mean kind of write that special Đúng here. Vậy the total điện tích is Q In plus Q on the outer shell. Vậy Q In is negative for nano coolant. Q Out is three. Vậy the total điện tích is minus it's going to be negative. Đúng. And one nano Coolum Được rồi. Vậy that's it. Vậy that's kind of the tricky part over here. Vậy at the end the field if and if I'm just worried about the độ lớn I'm not going to put in the negative sign here. But the độ lớn of the total điện tích is 1 nano cool. Vậy we're gonna have nine times 10 to the 9. This year is going to be one times ten to the negative nine and divided by Bây giờ the bigger radius because my I'm outside and it's zero point two five bình phương. Được I'll put that in the calculator and you should get approximately one hundred and forty four newtons per kilo get kind of a nice application of Gauss law to different radii.
