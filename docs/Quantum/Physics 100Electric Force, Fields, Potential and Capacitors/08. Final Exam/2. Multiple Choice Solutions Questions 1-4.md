### Tóm tắt nội dung

Here's multiple choice one chúng ta có two uncharged metal spheres one and two they're mounted on insulating supporting rods. Vậy maybe let me go ahead and kind of troll this kind of hình cầu number one and fear number two. OK. And Bây giờ a third metal hình cầu carrying POSITIVE điện tích IS THEN PLACE Mir number two. Vậy we better label these here. Vậy let me say this here is number one and this here's number two. Bây giờ we bring a third one close to number two. Vậy I mean actually bring this one a different color here Được. And they also say that number three is a positively charged. Vậy through some process it was positively has a net positive điện tích a copper wire is momentarily connected between one and two. Vậy here's our wire and then it's removed. Finally hình cầu three is removed. Vậy let's first take this into the situation to consideration. Vậy I bring this positively charged object. Well what is that going to do. Được rồi. It's going to hút some of the negative các điện tích from hình cầu one. Also the negative các điện tích from hình cầu to Đúng and that there is going to leave hình cầu one with a positive net điện tích because some of its electrons were attracted to the hình cầu number three which was positive and then what do you do well then you remove this guy whoops and then you remove the wire. Let me go ahead and remove the wire here. Color it in. Vậy if I then remove the wire I just cut it. What's gonna happen after that. Well this is what's going to be left over. And again don't forget we're also going to remove this guy. Đúng. Vậy once we remove hình cầu number three this is what we're left with. Được Vậy let's have a look at these choices Bây giờ. That's kind of the underlying physics behind it. Vậy hình cầu one in hình cầu two are still uncharged Không that's not what chúng ta có here guys hình cầu one carries a positive điện tích and hình cầu two carries a negative điện tích that one seems ok to me a circle outward hình cầu one carries negative nope that's not what's going to happen. hình cầu one both carry positive điện tích note both negative điện tích Vậy the correct answer for this one is B Ok Vậy it kind of helps to kind of draw each one of these in to xem xét that what is going to move and again it's only the negative các điện tích that can move OK on the chất dẫn điện's album to an outer space chúng ta có a positive điện tích q is release near a fixed điện tích Vậy this big điện tích q cannot move as Q moves away Vậy let me kind of to draw when it's a little bit farther away this is a little cute still positive what is true about the motion of this điện tích here and again there could be more than one correct choice Vậy it's be a little bit careful Vậy let's go through them in detail it will move will with decreasing tốc độ well imagine here it's released Đúng. Vậy here it's released Vậy its vận tốc was zero and what's going to happen. Well if you think about it what's going to be the lực tác dụng lên the positive điện tích q Đúng. There is a repulsive lực which is given by cool Holmes law. And that lực depends on the khoảng cách Ah well what happens as there is a lực it's going to start to accelerate it's going to start speeding up well what happens when it's farther away Đúng when it's all the way down over here again the ah gets smaller but the lực is still going to be in the same hướng it's still being repelled by this positive điện tích it's only moving like this. OK Vậy at the end it's always going to be speeding up it's just speeding up at a slower rate it's certainly not going to move with decreasing tốc độ is it going to move with hằng số gia tốc. Well I think what happens to the lực remember our lực for cool Ohm's Law will be k uppercase Q It's the điện tích of this hình cầu a little Q and divided by the khoảng cách bình phương the hướng we know is always in the same hướng Trong trường hợp này to the Đúng. Vậy as the khoảng cách gets bigger the lực gets smaller and noon second losses lực is equal to mass times gia tốc. Vậy over here my gia tốc down over here is going to be small as it gets farther away. Over here the gia tốc is bigger but it's always in the same hướng. The lực and the gia tốc are always in the same hướng Vậy it's definitely not hằng số because the lực changes. What else do chúng ta có it will move with increasing gia tốc. One that we just talked about that case Được. It's certainly not going to move like that. It will move with decreasing gia tốc Vâng. Đúng. This is what we just mentioned Đúng here because the lực gets smaller. It will move with increasing tốc độ. Được. Remember our definition of gia tốc. Definition of gia tốc is the change of vận tốc with relative to the change in time. Được Vậy my change of vận tốc is the gia tốc multiplied by the change in time. Well the gia tốc is always in this same position. Sorry same hướng. Therefore the change of vận tốc which is a final minus initial over here. This is always going to be speeding up because the gia tốc is always in the same hướng this number gets smaller but it never changes directions. Vậy the tốc độ is also always going to increase. Được rồi. Vậy Trong trường hợp này extremely choice D and choice E are the two correct answers Được rồi. Question 3 two point các điện tích Q1 and Q2 they're separated by khoảng cách. Are if the magnitudes of both các điện tích are halved and their separation is also half what's gonna happen to the electrical lực. OK. Vậy let's imagine here's our Q1 here's the Q2. We also said they are separated by some khoảng cách. Ah Được. Vậy Trong trường hợp này here. Well what would be the lực of lực tác dụng lên this I'll just call this case 1 would be k Q1 Q2 and divided by our square that would be the độ lớn of the lực. Được. Vậy what happens Bây giờ. Well let's compare it to lực numbe$r^2$. This is when I make the changes. Được. Vậy the first thing I notice is that both các điện tích are halved. Vậy we're gonna have q 1 ove$r^2$ and we're going to have Q2 ove$r^2$. What else. Their separation is also halved. Được. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the khoảng cách between them Bây giờ is going to be R ove$r^2$. Vậy let's substitute everything in here and see what happens. We're going to have q 1 ove$r^2$. We're going to have Q2 ove$r^2$ and we're going to have the khoảng cách. Bây giờ is not r it's R ove$r^2$ bình phương. Bây giờ you've got to take care of all these factors. Vậy you're going to have a factor of four in the denominator over here and you've got to be careful with this one Đúng. Because after you evaluate that one you're going to have K Q1 Q2. There's gonna be the one factor of one over 4 from both of those twos but here when you evaluate this it's going to look something like this Vậy these fours are actually going to cancel out and you could see what we're left with Đúng here is this term is the exact same as that one. Vậy at the end f 2 is going to be f 1. Vậy even though we've made these changes to both các điện tích and also change the khoảng cách at the end we get the same expression for the lực which means that E here has to be the correct answer it doesn't increase by any factor. Được. Vậy you're gonna be a little bit careful with these Được rồi. Let's read problem for here chúng ta có four point các điện tích. They have various magnitudes and they're arranged in this square configuration here. The length of the side is deep well which of the errors represents the net lực tác dụng lên this point điện tích here in the corner. Let me just go ahead and kind of draw that point điện tích it has a độ lớn of positive Q Được rồi. What you have to do is xem xét the interaction between this điện tích and the three other các điện tích Vậy you can xem xét them one at a time. Vậy let's first xem xét both of those both positive point điện tích. Vậy on điện tích q you should have a lực like this. Call it f 1. What about the fourth down here between this guy and this guy. Again they're both positive. Therefore the lực should be in this hướng. What else. Bây giờ you have the corner one and the bottom corner one one of them's positive the other one's negative. Vậy the forests should be attractive. Vậy it should be in this hướng. It's called this F 3. Được rồi. What you have to do Bây giờ is you have to add all these as vectors. If you add EF 1 and EF 2 together you're going to get a véctơ that is like this both EF 1 and EF 2 they have the same độ lớn. Đúng. They have to have the same độ lớn because you have positive two QS interacting with a positive Q điện tích. Vậy at the end chúng ta có to find what is this guy here. This is EF 1 plus EF 2 as a véctơ. Again you know this angle here should be forty five degrees because these are the same độ lớn of vectors. Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có to actually write down some of the magnitudes. First of all you can't have a véctơ that's going to be along B or D because we know it has to be along this line. Đúng. Vậy we're really comparing what is which véctơ is bigger this purple one or this green one. If we know which one is bigger than that'll be the hướng of the net lực. Vậy it certainly can't be B or D. Được rồi. We're left with either choice a choice c. Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có to look at the magnitudes. Well one thing that's easy to write is the độ lớn of EF 1 the độ lớn of EF 1 is simply k. chúng ta có positive q. chúng ta có two Q and they're separated by khoảng cách. Dean you have to square that thing. Vậy let me just put the two in the front. Q bình phương over d bình phương. This is EF 1. Well what about the độ lớn of this guy. Here you can use some trigonometry because the độ lớn of EF 1 plus EF 2 is going to be you can write that as again do some trigonometry Đúng sine of forty five or close of forty five is equal to EF 1 divided by the độ lớn of the hypotenuse here. Được rồi. Vậy really EF 1 should be something like this. This should be close of 45. And this here should be equal to the độ lớn of EF 1. This is just using some trigonometry Đúng here. OK. Vậy at the end the độ lớn of EF 1 plus EF 2 as a véctơ it's a little bit longer than what I thought it was going to be but a Coast of forty five is square root of two divided by two. Vậy at the end we should have something like this. It's Đúng to OK Q bình phương divided by D bình phương and Bây giờ I have to divide by two root to square root of two and divided by 2. Vậy at the end we get four square root of two K Q bình phương over d bình phương. Được rồi. Anyway this number here is going to be this is like one point four. You can get a number in the front. Let's look at the độ lớn of this véctơ or the độ lớn of F 3. Được. Vậy F 3 again is going to be equal to k. The độ lớn is the điện tích. Q The other điện tích is also has a độ lớn. Q It ought to put the negative sign that just tells me the hướng and Bây giờ divided by what is this khoảng cách here it's the khoảng cách bình phương Vậy it's gonna be this bình phương plus of this bình phương that gives me 2 D bình phương. That is the khoảng cách bình phương. Được. Here you have to use kind of Pythagorean Theorem in order to find what this distances. Được rồi. Vậy at the end if you compare both of those you should find that this lực here is bigger than this lực. Vậy điều đó có nghĩa là that the net lực is going to be along misdirection here. Được. Vậy a is actually the correct answer for this one. Được rồi. Let's go onto the next one.
