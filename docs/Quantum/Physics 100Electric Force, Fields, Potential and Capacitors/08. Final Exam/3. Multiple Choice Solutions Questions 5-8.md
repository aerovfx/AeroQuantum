### Tóm tắt nội dung

Được rồi here chúng ta có an electron is initially moving to the Đúng when it enters a uniform field directed upward as shown. Which trajectory will the electron follow in the field. Được. Well again let's xem xét this điện trường. What I like to do when somebody presents me with an điện trường like this if it's going up I know that điện trường goes from positive toward negative Đúng. Vậy then I have an electron while the electron is going to be repelled by all of these negative các điện tích and it's going to be attracted by each one of those. Vậy guess what it's going to do it's certainly not going to go up here and it's not going to go straight it has to go down Đúng. Vậy Z really has to be the correct answer. The other way to answer this would be just to xem xét this Đúng. Remember the lực is the điện tích multiplied by the field if since the điện tích is negative Đúng. We've got to remember this is an electron here. If chúng ta có an electron with a negative điện tích it means that the lực is always in the opposite hướng Đúng. Vậy this guy here is up if the điện tích is negative it means that the lực is going to be down. Được. And if you have a downward lực going to follow this one it's the only trajectory that's pointing down. Được rồi. Vậy these are the correct answer. Nice and easy one. Được rồi. Here chúng ta có number six. The figure shows two unequal các điện tích. OK. chúng ta có positive and chúng ta có a negative over here. The điện tích this guy here is greater độ lớn than the positive điện tích. That's why it's kind of bigger here. Point X is midway between the các điện tích in what section will there be a point where the resulting điện trường Trong trường hợp này the left field e is going to be zero. Được. Well let's xem xét each one separately. Được rồi let's make this one red and make this one blue in the total điện trường is you have to add them as vectors Vậy let's draw the field everywhere Vậy let's draw the first the điện trường produced by this positive điện tích it should point away from it. Đúng. Vậy in all of these different sections over here as I get farther away the fields should be getting smaller. The field is closest when the field is bigger when I am close to the điện tích here it's getting smaller and here it's getting smaller. That's the field produced by the positive điện tích. What about the negative one the field produced by the negative should point toward it. OK. Vậy here it should be pretty big should be pretty big when I'm close to it. And then as I get farther away should start getting smaller OK. Something like this. This is the field produced by this negative điện tích. Vậy one thing we notice here is that between both of them chúng ta có both electric fields that add up in the same hướng. Đúng. Vậy you're always going to have a net điện trường here for both of those choices. Vậy we definitely can't be w x or x y can't be w x or x y. Vậy we're left with kind of two places it's either going to be somewhere along this section y z or a long VW. Được rồi. Vậy Bây giờ what you have to do is you have to look at the độ lớn. The key to this problem is that this one is always going to be a bigger điện trường especially in this section over here Đúng in this section the blue line is always going to be bigger because guess what. It's closer. Được rồi. Vậy you're always going to have this one that the field produced by the negative Q is always going to be bigger than not one. Vậy the net in this section although it's going to be smaller it's always going to be pointing to the left toward the negative điện tích. It's really only in this section over here where you could have cancellation. Được rồi fields are going to cancel out here because again you're closer to the small positive điện tích. Vậy that produces a field and you end up being farther from the negative. However that điện tích is bigger. Đúng. If you remember the field produced by this guy here again just the độ lớn would be k uppercase Q divided by our bình phương. Vậy although this is bigger this guy here is also bigger. Vậy there is the possibility that you could cancel out the điện trường. It'll be somewhere in this space Đúng here Đúng. Vậy they're really the only correct answer has to be this VW segment. Được rồi. Vậy hopefully you understand that Được rồi problem seven looks like this the figure here shows điện trường lines produced by two small các điện tích p and q xem xét the following statements The first statement says the điện tích on P is smaller than the điện tích on Q and the second statement says the electrostatic lực on P is smaller than the electrostatic lực on Q Được rồi which of the above statements are true. OK. Vậy is the first one true and how would we argue it is the điện tích on P smaller. Vậy first of all they're both positive Đúng they're both positive and how do I know that I know that because the field lines point away from both of those các điện tích. Vậy that is really how I know they're both positive. Let me write that down field lines point away Được rồi. Vậy the next scene how do I know which one is bigger and which one is smaller is p smaller. Vâng. Vậy the điện tích on P I mean just điện tích and call it Kewpie has to be smaller than the điện tích on Q and how do I know that there are fewer field lines fewer field lines indicate that the điện tích is going to be smaller on that one. OK if I have a lot of field lines it tells me that the độ lớn of the điện trường in this region is big compared to the điện trường in this region because I have more field lines going through it. Vậy definitely the first one is true. Được rồi how about the second statement. The electrostatic lực on P is smaller. Well what do we know about the lực. The lực is given by cool arms law. We know there's going to be a lực acting like this and there's going to be an bằng nhau và ngược chiều lực Đúng. When you write the lực it's only one Đúng it'll be the điện tích on P it be the điện tích on Q and divided by the khoảng cách bình phương but that's it. điều đó có nghĩa là on this guy there is a lực acting like this. And on this guy there's a lực acting like this. These các lực are bằng nhau và ngược chiều. Được Vậy this one here is actually false. Vậy really it's only the first statement that is true. Vậy for this one A is the correct answer. Problem 8 we say a solid aluminum cube rests on a wooden table in a region where there is a uniform electric feel and it's directed straight upward. Được rồi. What can we say concerning the các điện tích on the top mặt of the Cube. Được. Kind of a good problem. Here we go here's our table. Let me draw this cube over here. Let's draw. Maybe this color Được. And it's a chất dẫn điện Đúng. Because we know it's aluminum. What else. Oh there's an điện trường that's directed straight up. Vậy the điện trường is produced by something else. Let me just draw it straight up that's the điện trường. Bây giờ again they're asking what's going on with the top mặt here. Vậy what's gonna happen here to the top mặt. Well what happens to the free electrons of this cube where are they going to go again you what you could do is you could picture what produces this kind of điện trường it's something that would be positively charged down here and maybe some negative các điện tích somewhere up here Vậy the electrons that are on this piece of aluminum the free ones any way they want to go toward the positive ones Đúng. Vậy that will leave that the top mặt has to be positively charged because the electrons of this aluminum are gonna go in the down on the bottom mặt. Vậy the top mặt at the end has to be positively charged. Được. Vậy for number eight really the top surfaces positively điện tích. That's choice a.
