00:00.120 --> 00:06.030
Here's multiple choice one we have two uncharged metal spheres one and two they're mounted on insulating

00:06.030 --> 00:06.950
supporting rods.

00:06.960 --> 00:14.340
So maybe let me go ahead and kind of troll this kind of sphere number one and fear number two.

00:14.370 --> 00:15.240
OK.

00:15.360 --> 00:21.910
And now a third metal sphere carrying POSITIVE CHARGE IS THEN PLACE Mir number two.

00:21.920 --> 00:23.760
So we better label these here.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.350
So let me say this here is number one and this here's number two.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.870
Now we bring a third one close to number two.

00:30.930 --> 00:34.150
So I mean actually bring this one a different color here okay.

00:34.440 --> 00:39.440
And they also say that number three is a positively charged.

00:39.500 --> 00:46.830
So through some process it was positively has a net positive charge a copper wire is momentarily connected

00:46.830 --> 00:47.970
between one and two.

00:47.970 --> 00:52.540
So here's our wire and then it's removed.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.340
Finally sphere three is removed.

00:54.340 --> 00:58.680
So let's first take this into the situation to consideration.

00:58.740 --> 01:01.440
So I bring this positively charged object.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.290
Well what is that going to do.

01:03.300 --> 01:03.690
All right.

01:03.780 --> 01:07.950
It's going to attract some of the negative charges from sphere one.

01:07.950 --> 01:15.570
Also the negative charges from sphere to right and that there is going to leave sphere one with a positive

01:15.570 --> 01:21.810
net charge because some of its electrons were attracted to the sphere number three which was positive

01:22.260 --> 01:29.250
and then what do you do well then you remove this guy whoops and then you remove the wire.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.630
Let me go ahead and remove the wire here.

01:31.660 --> 01:33.360
Color it in.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.080
So if I then remove the wire I just cut it.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.410
What's gonna happen after that.

01:37.410 --> 01:39.570
Well this is what's going to be left over.

01:39.660 --> 01:43.550
And again don't forget we're also going to remove this guy.

01:43.680 --> 01:43.970
Right.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.760
So once we remove sphere number three this is what we're left with.

01:48.410 --> 01:50.510
Okay so let's have a look at these choices now.

01:50.580 --> 01:53.960
That's kind of the underlying physics behind it.

01:54.900 --> 02:02.400
So sphere one in sphere two are still uncharged No that's not what we have here guys sphere one carries

02:02.400 --> 02:07.770
a positive charge and Sphere two carries a negative charge that one seems ok to me a circle outward

02:07.770 --> 02:11.110
sphere one carries negative nope that's not what's going to happen.

02:11.220 --> 02:17.250
Sphere one both carry positive charge note both negative charge so the correct answer for this one is

02:17.250 --> 02:23.340
B Ok so it kind of helps to kind of draw each one of these in to consider that what is going to move

02:23.340 --> 02:30.270
and again it's only the negative charges that can move OK on the conductor's album to an outer space

02:30.300 --> 02:38.970
we have a positive charge q is release near a fixed charge so this big charge q cannot move as Q moves

02:38.970 --> 02:45.210
away so let me kind of to draw when it's a little bit farther away this is a little cute still positive

02:45.210 --> 02:51.020
what is true about the motion of this charge here and again there could be more than one correct choice

02:51.040 --> 02:56.550
so it's be a little bit careful so let's go through them in detail it will move will with decreasing

02:56.550 --> 02:59.610
speed well imagine here it's released right.

02:59.650 --> 03:04.140
So here it's released so its velocity was zero and what's going to happen.

03:04.140 --> 03:09.010
Well if you think about it what's going to be the force acting on the positive charge q right.

03:09.020 --> 03:13.290
There is a repulsive force which is given by cool Holmes law.

03:13.470 --> 03:20.280
And that force depends on the distance Ah well what happens as there is a force it's going to start

03:20.280 --> 03:26.310
to accelerate it's going to start speeding up well what happens when it's farther away right when it's

03:26.310 --> 03:34.110
all the way down over here again the ah gets smaller but the force is still going to be in the same

03:34.110 --> 03:39.580
direction it's still being repelled by this positive charge it's only moving like this.

03:39.620 --> 03:46.740
OK so at the end it's always going to be speeding up it's just speeding up at a slower rate it's certainly

03:46.740 --> 03:53.190
not going to move with decreasing speed is it going to move with constant acceleration.

03:53.190 --> 03:59.600
Well I think what happens to the force remember our force for cool Ohm's Law will be k uppercase Q It's

03:59.610 --> 04:06.210
the charge of this sphere a little Q and divided by the distance squared the direction we know is always

04:06.210 --> 04:08.600
in the same direction in this case to the right.

04:08.700 --> 04:15.780
So as the distance gets bigger the force gets smaller and noon second losses force is equal to mass

04:15.780 --> 04:16.970
times acceleration.

04:17.400 --> 04:23.640
So over here my acceleration down over here is going to be small as it gets farther away.

04:23.640 --> 04:28.360
Over here the acceleration is bigger but it's always in the same direction.

04:28.440 --> 04:33.720
The force and the acceleration are always in the same direction so it's definitely not constant because

04:33.720 --> 04:35.930
the force changes.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.480
What else do we have it will move with increasing acceleration.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.520
One that we just talked about that case okay.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.720
It's certainly not going to move like that.

04:43.890 --> 04:46.880
It will move with decreasing acceleration yes.

04:46.890 --> 04:47.160
Right.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.700
This is what we just mentioned right here because the force gets smaller.

04:50.730 --> 04:53.520
It will move with increasing speed.

04:53.550 --> 04:53.820
Okay.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.680
Remember our definition of acceleration.

04:56.820 --> 05:02.700
Definition of acceleration is the change of velocity with relative to the change in time.

05:02.710 --> 05:09.070
Okay so my change of velocity is the acceleration multiplied by the change in time.

05:09.190 --> 05:12.620
Well the acceleration is always in this same position.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.090
Sorry same direction.

05:14.200 --> 05:18.820
Therefore the change of velocity which is a final minus initial over here.

05:18.970 --> 05:23.980
This is always going to be speeding up because the acceleration is always in the same direction this

05:23.980 --> 05:27.180
number gets smaller but it never changes directions.

05:27.230 --> 05:31.010
So the speed is also always going to increase.

05:31.050 --> 05:31.410
All right.

05:31.450 --> 05:40.620
So in this case extremely choice D and choice E are the two correct answers all right.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.970
Question 3 two point charges Q1 and Q2 they're separated by distance.

05:45.010 --> 05:52.200
Are if the magnitudes of both charges are halved and their separation is also half what's gonna happen

05:52.200 --> 05:54.120
to the electrical force.

05:54.140 --> 05:54.480
OK.

05:54.510 --> 05:59.450
So let's imagine here's our Q1 here's the Q2.

06:00.150 --> 06:03.010
We also said they are separated by some distance.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.430
Ah okay.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.600
So in this case here.

06:06.750 --> 06:16.060
Well what would be the force of force acting on this I'll just call this case 1 would be k Q1 Q2 and

06:16.080 --> 06:20.280
divided by our square that would be the magnitude of the force.

06:20.280 --> 06:20.550
Okay.

06:20.550 --> 06:21.720
So what happens now.

06:21.750 --> 06:25.470
Well let's compare it to force number 2.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.100
This is when I make the changes.

06:27.150 --> 06:27.640
Okay.

06:27.780 --> 06:31.160
So the first thing I notice is that both charges are halved.

06:31.260 --> 06:36.030
So we're gonna have q 1 over 2 and we're going to have Q2 over 2.

06:36.180 --> 06:36.780
What else.

06:36.780 --> 06:38.730
Their separation is also halved.

06:38.940 --> 06:39.210
Okay.

06:39.240 --> 06:43.670
So that means that the distance between them now is going to be R over 2.

06:43.710 --> 06:46.950
So let's substitute everything in here and see what happens.

06:46.950 --> 06:49.520
We're going to have q 1 over 2.

06:49.650 --> 06:54.210
We're going to have Q2 over 2 and we're going to have the distance.

06:54.210 --> 06:58.340
Now is not r it's R over 2 squared.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.210
Now you've got to take care of all these factors.

07:00.230 --> 07:05.280
So you're going to have a factor of four in the denominator over here and you've got to be careful with

07:05.280 --> 07:06.130
this one right.

07:06.150 --> 07:13.590
Because after you evaluate that one you're going to have K Q1 Q2.

07:14.130 --> 07:20.430
There's gonna be the one factor of one over 4 from both of those twos but here when you evaluate this

07:21.900 --> 07:26.280
it's going to look something like this so these fours are actually going to cancel out and you could

07:26.280 --> 07:31.920
see what we're left with right here is this term is the exact same as that one.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.380
So at the end f 2 is going to be f 1.

07:34.380 --> 07:39.570
So even though we've made these changes to both charges and also change the distance at the end we get

07:39.570 --> 07:46.500
the same expression for the force which means that E here has to be the correct answer it doesn't increase

07:46.500 --> 07:48.090
by any factor.

07:48.090 --> 07:48.260
Okay.

07:48.270 --> 07:52.250
So you're gonna be a little bit careful with these all right.

07:52.260 --> 07:55.710
Let's read problem for here we have four point charges.

07:55.710 --> 07:59.820
They have various magnitudes and they're arranged in this square configuration here.

07:59.940 --> 08:05.580
The length of the side is deep well which of the errors represents the net force acting on this point

08:05.580 --> 08:07.160
charge here in the corner.

08:07.170 --> 08:12.250
Let me just go ahead and kind of draw that point charge it has a magnitude of positive Q All right.

08:12.460 --> 08:17.700
What you have to do is consider the interaction between this charge and the three other charges so you

08:17.700 --> 08:19.140
can consider them one at a time.

08:19.140 --> 08:23.090
So let's first consider both of those both positive point charge.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.920
So on charge q you should have a force like this.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.580
Call it f 1.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.680
What about the fourth down here between this guy and this guy.

08:31.680 --> 08:34.020
Again they're both positive.

08:34.020 --> 08:37.950
Therefore the force should be in this direction.

08:37.980 --> 08:38.400
What else.

08:38.400 --> 08:45.420
Now you have the corner one and the bottom corner one one of them's positive the other one's negative.

08:45.450 --> 08:48.220
So the forests should be attractive.

08:48.690 --> 08:50.310
So it should be in this direction.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.960
It's called this F 3.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.160
All right.

08:53.190 --> 08:56.520
What you have to do now is you have to add all these as vectors.

08:56.520 --> 09:03.210
If you add EF 1 and EF 2 together you're going to get a vector that is like this both EF 1 and EF 2

09:03.540 --> 09:05.590
they have the same magnitude.

09:05.640 --> 09:05.880
Right.

09:05.880 --> 09:11.940
They have to have the same magnitude because you have positive two QS interacting with a positive Q

09:11.940 --> 09:12.700
charge.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.540
So at the end we have to find what is this guy here.

09:15.540 --> 09:18.920
This is EF 1 plus EF 2 as a vector.

09:19.170 --> 09:24.410
Again you know this angle here should be forty five degrees because these are the same magnitude of

09:24.420 --> 09:25.870
vectors.

09:26.130 --> 09:26.340
All right.

09:26.370 --> 09:29.490
So now we have to actually write down some of the magnitudes.

09:29.490 --> 09:34.620
First of all you can't have a vector that's going to be along B or D because we know it has to be along

09:34.620 --> 09:35.510
this line.

09:35.610 --> 09:35.790
Right.

09:35.790 --> 09:41.460
So we're really comparing what is which vector is bigger this purple one or this green one.

09:41.460 --> 09:45.510
If we know which one is bigger than that'll be the direction of the net force.

09:45.540 --> 09:48.130
So it certainly can't be B or D.

09:48.330 --> 09:48.540
All right.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.370
We're left with either choice a choice c.

09:51.510 --> 09:53.750
So now we have to look at the magnitudes.

09:53.760 --> 10:01.990
Well one thing that's easy to write is the magnitude of EF 1 the magnitude of EF 1 is simply k.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.180
We have positive q.

10:04.260 --> 10:07.900
We have two Q and they're separated by distance.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.850
Dean you have to square that thing.

10:09.990 --> 10:12.800
So let me just put the two in the front.

10:12.930 --> 10:15.870
Q squared over d squared.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.890
This is EF 1.

10:17.970 --> 10:19.800
Well what about the magnitude of this guy.

10:19.800 --> 10:28.350
Here you can use some trigonometry because the magnitude of EF 1 plus EF 2 is going to be you can write

10:28.350 --> 10:36.540
that as again do some trigonometry right sine of forty five or close of forty five is equal to EF 1

10:37.530 --> 10:41.450
divided by the magnitude of the hypotenuse here.

10:41.460 --> 10:41.840
All right.

10:41.910 --> 10:46.770
So really EF 1 should be something like this.

10:46.870 --> 10:49.210
This should be close of 45.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.530
And this here should be equal to the magnitude of EF 1.

10:52.530 --> 10:55.570
This is just using some trigonometry right here.

10:55.860 --> 10:56.850
OK.

10:56.950 --> 11:05.790
So at the end the magnitude of EF 1 plus EF 2 as a vector it's a little bit longer than what I thought

11:05.790 --> 11:12.060
it was going to be but a Coast of forty five is square root of two divided by two.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.590
So at the end we should have something like this.

11:14.600 --> 11:24.780
It's right to OK Q squared divided by D squared and now I have to divide by two root to square root

11:24.780 --> 11:27.120
of two and divided by 2.

11:27.210 --> 11:33.470
So at the end we get four square root of two K Q squared over d squared.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.400
All right.

11:34.530 --> 11:38.760
Anyway this number here is going to be this is like one point four.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.290
You can get a number in the front.

11:40.350 --> 11:43.690
Let's look at the magnitude of this vector or the magnitude of F 3.

11:44.450 --> 11:44.760
Okay.

11:44.790 --> 11:49.420
So F 3 again is going to be equal to k.

11:49.590 --> 11:51.540
The magnitude is the charge.

11:51.540 --> 11:54.660
Q The other charge is also has a magnitude.

11:54.660 --> 11:59.460
Q It ought to put the negative sign that just tells me the direction and now divided by what is this

11:59.460 --> 12:07.100
distance here it's the distance squared so it's gonna be this squared plus of this squared that gives

12:07.100 --> 12:09.500
me 2 D squared.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.080
That is the distance squared.

12:11.180 --> 12:11.360
Okay.

12:11.370 --> 12:17.900
Here you have to use kind of Pythagorean Theorem in order to find what this distances.

12:17.900 --> 12:18.530
All right.

12:18.530 --> 12:25.250
So at the end if you compare both of those you should find that this force here is bigger than this

12:25.250 --> 12:26.130
force.

12:26.150 --> 12:30.150
So that means that the net force is going to be along misdirection here.

12:30.200 --> 12:30.700
Okay.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.570
So a is actually the correct answer for this one.

12:34.460 --> 12:35.070
All right.

12:35.240 --> 12:36.360
Let's go onto the next one.
