### Tóm tắt nội dung

Here chúng ta có a uniform electric fuel with độ lớn given by this six times ten of the six newtons per Coolum is directed along the x axis a cube having an edge of zero point one metres is oriented as shown in the figure. WHAT IS THE ELECTRIC thông lượng passing through the shaded area Đúng here. Được rồi. Vậy HOW DO WE FIND THE ELECTRIC thông lượng here. Just going through this area Đúng here. Given the dimensions of everything and the điện trường. Vậy again if you xem xét the điện trường here is in the positive x axis or fields should be going directly like this. We also would have liked the area the normal to the area the véctơ that's perpendicular IS ALSO LIKE THIS. Được rồi. Vậy IF YOU REMEMBER THE DEFINITION OF THE ELECTRIC thông lượng it would be the for a hằng số field anyway it's the độ lớn of the field the độ lớn of the area and coast of the angle between the điện trường and the véctơ that's perpendicular to the area. Trong trường hợp này here the theta is equal to zero degrees Vậy coast of zero equals to one. Vậy we don't have to worry about this. Vậy our electric thông lượng reduces the simply the field độ lớn multiplied by the area. Vậy this is pretty easy. Field độ lớn IS SIX TIMES 10 TO THE 6 in the area. Again it's a square and the side is zero point one Vậy you have to square that thing. Vậy again six times tend to the six I don't even need a calculator for this one this is zero point zero one at the annual SHOULD GET SIX TIMES 10 TO THE FOUR. Được Vậy THE CORRECT ANSWER FOR THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE choice B. Vậy nothing too difficult about this problem. Hopefully you got that one Được rồi. Question 10 says chúng ta có two tiny particles having these các điện tích over here they're separated by 20 centimeters. What are the magnitudes and hướng of the điện trường midway between the các điện tích. Được rồi Vậy let's go ahead and draw them out. Vậy chúng ta có a 20 micro Coolum điện tích 20 micro cool on and then we're going to have a negative 8 micro Coolum. Put this one here and this is negative 8 micro cool. And what we want to know is at the midway between them they're separated by 20 centimeters. Vậy that's this khoảng cách Đúng here I'm going to put that Đúng in meters Đúng away that zero point two meters. What we want to know here is Đúng here at the midpoint what is the điện trường Đúng here at this point. Vậy first thing chúng ta có to figure out is where there's going to be two contributions to the điện trường. There is the điện trường produced by the positive one which is like this. This here has a độ lớn let's call it E E 1 and the negative điện tích also produces an điện trường. And again we're going to call it's độ lớn E 2. At the end chúng ta có to add them up as vectors since they're in the same hướng we simply have to add them up. One thing we could do Đúng away is that if you look at all these choices some of them say it's directed toward the positive điện tích Vậy it can't be anything directed toward the positive điện tích. It has to be directed toward the negative điện tích. Được rồi. Vậy let's eliminate choice to be in choice D Đúng away. And Bây giờ we're left with different độ lớn. Vậy Bây giờ chúng ta có to be a little bit more careful rights either tend to the fourth end of the five or ten to the six. Vậy let's go ahead and look at the magnitudes of each one of those things. Được rồi. Vậy E one Đúng here is going to be k q and divided by the khoảng cách. Bây giờ the khoảng cách is zero point one bình phương. Được rồi. And e to is going to be k its điện tích here is going to be Vậy let's just call it Q2 and again the khoảng cách is still zero point one bình phương. Let's go ahead and substitute in all our numbers here nine times 10 to the nine is for the K value. This điện tích is 20 micro cooldown times tend to the negative 6. And all of this divided by zero point one bình phương. Được rồi Vậy be a little bit careful when you plug that in your calculator for the negative điện tích you have. Whoops just said Let's substitute our numbers Vậy we get nine times ten to the nine for our hằng số k. The độ lớn of this điện tích is eight times tend to the negative six. And Bây giờ how far is it away from that điện tích the point where we're evaluating the field is zero point one meter. Được rồi. At the end what you have to do here is you have to add both of those up. Vậy chúng ta có to take tính toán those numbers and add them up. Được rồi. Bây giờ I'm going to let you kind of go ahead and do that at the end. If you do it correctly. Let me check my answers Đúng here. I think I obtain an answer which was a 10 to the six. Được rồi it's over 10 if you do careful here at the end e total is equal to the độ lớn of each one plus the độ lớn of E two. OK. Which gives me twenty five point two times ten of the six. And that's measured and nuanced per Pakula that's our độ lớn. Được rồi. But those are the basic steps into getting to that answer Được rồi. Here's number 11. The end of the electrical thế Trong trường hợp này OK electrical thế a khoảng cách of 4 meters from a certain point các điện tích to 200 Vôn. What is the thế at a khoảng cách of two meters from the same điện tích. Được rồi. Vậy let me kind of draw this one out here. Vậy chúng ta có oh let's get rid of that maybe use this. Được rồi let's draw a positive chart. I know it's positive because it's 200 Vôn and I'm going to be a certain khoảng cách of four meters away. Vậy let me draw kind of point over here that's four meters away. I don't know exactly where that is. Vậy really could be kind of anywhere on this hình cầu that is four meters away. Đúng. That the thế everywhere here is two hundred Vôn and the công thức you would use to tính toán this would be that the thế V from the point điện tích it would be k q divided by the khoảng cách Trong trường hợp này it's the khoảng cách are Vậy hours for what is the thế Bây giờ if you're only two meters away. Vậy what if you cut that khoảng cách in half what happens Được. Well if you think about it Bây giờ. Vậy when you're four Đúng here. Vậy if I make the khoảng cách smaller I should have a higher electrical thế. Được. And again if the khoảng cách Bây giờ is two instead of keeping everything else the same which you would have is the thế would be k q the same K the same Q And the khoảng cách Bây giờ is are over two. Vậy it really be two times k q over R and this guy here in the bracket is what we call two hundred Vôn. Vậy Trong trường hợp này here you'd have to have four hundred Vôn Vậy the thế gets bigger as I go closer. Được. And for this case here going from two meters to four meters I doubling the khoảng cách Trong trường hợp này the thế goes down by a factor of two. Vậy chúng ta có to have 400 Vôn. I would have probably eliminated choice B Đúng away and a whole Vậy choice D I would have probably also eliminated choice a the thế is not going to stay the same because it's produced by a point điện tích and it's not going to get smaller because I'm getting closer to that điện tích. Vậy I would have been left with only two choices and then doing a little bit of math would have got me to the Đúng answer. Vậy sees the Đúng answer here. Được rồi. Vậy let's have a look in number 12. chúng ta có two protons are fired toward each other in a particle accelerator with only the electrostatic lực acting which of the following statements must be true as they move closer together. OK. There could be more than one answer. Vậy let's kind of draw it out here. Imagine when they're really far away. Vậy there's a lực tác dụng lên them it's repulsive Đúng the lực might look something like this might look something like this. That's the lực. What else. They're probably moving at a certain tốc độ. Được rồi. Vậy what's happening to that tốc độ as they get closer as they get closer and maybe eventually they might be something like this. How would you draw the lực Trong trường hợp này. I think I would draw a bigger Đúng because the khoảng cách is smaller. They're probably slowing down Vậy I don't know maybe make the vận tốc a little bit smaller. There might be a point where they get close. They don't quite touch. They get to zero and then they start going back. Được rồi. Vậy let's have a look at some of these choices here. There are electrical thế energy Kipps keeps increasing. Vậy do chúng ta có more thế energy over here. Well think about it in terms of kinetic and electrical thế. OK. Vậy this is really the two forms of energy that chúng ta có. chúng ta có kinetic plus thế Đúng over here and the first step. chúng ta có a lot of động năng. Vậy chúng ta có a small thế energy. Vậy what happens as they get closer the động năng gets smaller. Vậy the thế energy has to go up because the total energy is conserved. Vậy yeah that wouldn't make sense to me. What else. Their động năng keeps increasing. Well Không that's not true Đúng. Because they're slowing down. Đúng. Because there's a lực acting in the opposite hướng. There are electrical thế energy keeps decreasing on Không. That can't be because we just said the động năng gets smaller. Vậy that has to come at the expense of the electrostatic thế energy their động năng keeps decreasing. Vâng. This one here makes sense. Vậy chúng ta có a That's good chúng ta có d That's good. Their gia tốc keeps decreasing. OK. Why when I read the word gia tốc I immediately think about the lực is the lực getting smaller or is the lực getting bigger. Được rồi. We just said here lực gets bigger. Được rồi. And the way we argue that is just by using cool Ohm's law it's the same các điện tích but the khoảng cách between them is getting smaller. Vậy if I divide by a small number I'm going to get a larger lực larger lực means larger gia tốc. Được rồi. Vậy a India the correct answers for this one.
