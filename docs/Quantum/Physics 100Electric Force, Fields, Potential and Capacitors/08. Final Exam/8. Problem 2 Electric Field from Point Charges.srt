00:00.120 --> 00:06.150
All right here we have an electric dipole it consists of two charges of six micro cool on one's positive

00:06.150 --> 00:08.220
ones negative they're 10 centimeters apart.

00:08.220 --> 00:14.190
We want to find the magnitude and the direction of the electric field that it produces over here.

00:14.190 --> 00:14.470
All right.

00:14.490 --> 00:19.410
So let me just kind of draw this one red and the negative one blue.

00:19.460 --> 00:22.190
So we have to do is consider the superposition.

00:22.200 --> 00:22.440
Right.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.660
So the positive one produces an electric field in this direction.

00:27.660 --> 00:27.810
OK.

00:27.810 --> 00:33.860
Can I call that a e positive and the negative one produces an electric feel that points toward it.

00:33.870 --> 00:36.810
It should have the same magnitude.

00:36.810 --> 00:38.680
And that is going to be a negative.

00:39.450 --> 00:42.920
Well you want to do now as you want to add both of those as vectors.

00:42.930 --> 00:49.620
If I put the blue one over here this is e minus the total electric field should look like a vector that

00:49.620 --> 00:53.260
points like this to the left.

00:53.490 --> 00:53.730
All right.

00:53.760 --> 00:59.130
So that's the total electric field so we could start off first of all by finding a couple of things

00:59.130 --> 01:00.660
first of all.

01:00.780 --> 01:04.810
What about this angle here I'm gonna need this angle because at the end I want to break this down in

01:04.810 --> 01:06.310
two components.

01:06.380 --> 01:07.260
OK.

01:07.620 --> 01:08.340
The angle.

01:08.340 --> 01:14.460
Well one thing you should notice is that if I know this distance of the hypotenuse and let's imagine

01:14.460 --> 01:17.000
I break this down into two equal triangles.

01:17.370 --> 01:23.410
I know the length of the hypotenuse and I know the length of the adjacent side so I can use coasts.

01:23.420 --> 01:29.980
All right so coasts of theta should be like seven over.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.470
Sorry FIVE OVER SEVEN.

01:31.470 --> 01:34.330
LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.580
ALL RIGHT FIVE OVER SEVEN.

01:35.580 --> 01:41.010
Something like that so you can find with the angle theta is here and you should get theta that's forty

01:41.010 --> 01:43.240
four point four degrees I think I got.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.000
OK.

01:44.010 --> 01:45.990
So that's gonna be important later on.

01:46.140 --> 01:51.060
And then at the end if we're looking for the total field you notice that the total field only has a

01:51.060 --> 01:54.140
component like this it has no vertical component.

01:54.210 --> 01:59.760
So really what we're doing here is at the end we're going to break it down into components if I think

01:59.760 --> 02:05.460
about that red vector there that red vector I can break down into two components I could break down

02:05.460 --> 02:08.250
into a vertical component.

02:08.250 --> 02:13.520
This is E plus sign of the angle theta and a horizontal component.

02:13.560 --> 02:17.880
This guy here is E plus coasts of the angle theta.

02:17.880 --> 02:23.380
So my total field really at the end should boil down to this.

02:23.430 --> 02:27.720
I'm gonna have two of those because the negative one the magnitude is the same.

02:27.840 --> 02:34.260
So it should end up being simply two times the magnitude of the field produced by one of those charges

02:34.680 --> 02:38.380
multiplied by coast of the angle theta.

02:38.630 --> 02:39.210
All right.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.760
So we still have to do this work right here what is the field produced by one of those point charges

02:43.760 --> 02:44.660
right here.

02:44.660 --> 02:45.990
So I need to find what this is.

02:45.990 --> 02:48.300
I'm going to do this right here over here.

02:48.650 --> 02:53.650
So the field produced by this positive charge right here at Point P.

02:53.710 --> 02:54.000
OK.

02:54.010 --> 03:00.170
Again it's the value K it's going to be the magnitude of the charge which I'm just going to call Q for

03:00.170 --> 03:02.870
now and divided by the distance squared.

03:02.870 --> 03:09.110
So let's substitute all our values and find with this magnitude of that red vector is this is nine times

03:09.110 --> 03:19.790
10 to the nine the charge that's producing it is six micro Coolum and the distance is seven centimeters

03:19.820 --> 03:24.000
and so far it is from the point so it's zero point zero seven meters.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.500
And you have to square that.

03:26.510 --> 03:26.750
All right.

03:26.810 --> 03:35.340
If I did this correctly I would get a field of one point one times tend to the seven Newton's preschool

03:35.340 --> 03:37.240
on.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.480
So now you've got to substitute everything back over here.

03:40.500 --> 03:40.640
Yeah.

03:40.660 --> 03:45.590
So I would get the same magnitude for the field produced by the negative charge.

03:45.590 --> 03:45.860
Right.

03:45.890 --> 03:52.660
I still get one point one times 10 to seven Newtons per call only it would just be in a different direction

03:53.270 --> 03:58.940
but at the end I'm only interested in picking off both of those horizontal components.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.120
We're gonna go back and just substitute everything here.

04:01.130 --> 04:08.330
So you total it put in all the numbers now it's two multiplied by one point one times 10 to the seven

04:08.960 --> 04:11.300
and multiplied by Kosovo 44.

04:11.390 --> 04:15.470
I wanted to I could also just write five over seven right here.

04:15.470 --> 04:16.500
That's the same thing.

04:18.200 --> 04:26.750
So e total at the end of the day the magnitude one point six times tend to the seven Newtons curriculum

04:27.320 --> 04:30.110
the direction again the direction is like this right.

04:30.110 --> 04:37.550
I would say to the left I've defined the total vector now of this electric field produced by the dipole.
