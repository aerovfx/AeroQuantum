00:00.120 --> 00:07.440
Let's have a look at problem 13 to ideal parallel play capacitors are identical except one has twice

00:07.440 --> 00:08.850
the area of the other.

00:09.090 --> 00:15.690
If the smaller capacitor has a capacitance labeled as C the larger one has capacitance.

00:15.720 --> 00:15.950
OK.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.970
So this is kind of the large versus the small.

00:20.970 --> 00:24.000
And again these plates are separated by a certain distance.

00:24.870 --> 00:27.360
Let's just assume they're just air filled.

00:27.390 --> 00:32.880
Again the capacitance of the smaller one would write it maybe as this if you remember the parallel plate

00:32.880 --> 00:39.210
capacitor it's a primitive city of free space multiplied by the area of the plate and divided by the

00:39.210 --> 00:40.170
distance.

00:40.620 --> 00:44.020
So in this case it would be the area of this plate right here.

00:44.070 --> 00:49.340
Now what we've just said is that the area of this guy is two times whatever the area of that one is.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.810
But the spacing is the same.

00:51.810 --> 00:57.570
So right the capacitor of the large plate would be Epsilon 0.

00:57.570 --> 01:02.620
The area is two times a and divided by the distance.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.830
So all of this I can take the two out and everything that's left over.

01:06.830 --> 01:13.680
Well if you look at everything here in the bracket this looks identical to the capacitance of the small.

01:14.130 --> 01:15.240
And that makes sense right.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.870
If you have larger plates it means you can put more charge on it.

01:20.310 --> 01:20.670
Okay.

01:20.670 --> 01:22.670
And you're gonna have twice as much capacity.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.030
So the correct answer for this one is C..

01:25.080 --> 01:27.180
Pretty straightforward.

01:27.180 --> 01:34.560
Number 14 when two or more various capacitors are connected in parallel to each other you just highlight

01:34.560 --> 01:39.030
that across one battery which are the following statements must be true.

01:39.030 --> 01:41.700
And again we could have more than one correct answer.

01:41.700 --> 01:48.780
I would do as I would probably just draw a diagram draw a battery and let's draw some capacitors.

01:48.810 --> 01:55.650
And we'd only have to put two to two or more but let's just this one here is capacitance C1 and this

01:55.650 --> 01:59.060
one here is capacitance C2.

01:59.190 --> 01:59.970
All right.

02:00.210 --> 02:04.140
The potential difference across each capacitor is the same.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.820
Yeah I imagine this is like a 12 volt battery.

02:07.020 --> 02:09.840
That means that this is a parallel circuit right.

02:09.870 --> 02:16.330
So it means that the voltage across a points A and B must also be 12 volts.

02:16.340 --> 02:19.170
You're going to have 12 volts across each one.

02:19.230 --> 02:21.310
Consider point C and D over here.

02:21.390 --> 02:23.250
I'm also going to measure 12 volts.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.170
It has to be equal to the voltage of the battery.

02:25.470 --> 02:27.940
So this one here is true.

02:28.110 --> 02:31.650
Each capacitor carries the same amount of charge.

02:31.650 --> 02:36.300
Well let's think about it from and how much charge do I have on capacitor C one.

02:36.300 --> 02:42.690
Well if I remember my equation it's the charge is equal to the capacitance multiplied by the voltage

02:42.690 --> 02:44.940
across which you just said is going to be the same.

02:44.970 --> 02:52.260
I was going to call it V which is the voltage of the battery 12 volts the charge on capacitor C2 would

02:52.260 --> 02:56.550
be well C two multiplied by the voltage across.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.850
Now the voltage is the same but the capacitance might not be the same.

02:59.850 --> 03:05.520
They're not necessarily identical to each other so that means that each capacitor might not have the

03:05.520 --> 03:10.020
same amount of charge right if this value C one is different from C two that's it.

03:10.020 --> 03:16.530
You have different amount of charge the equivalent capacitance of this combination is less than the

03:16.530 --> 03:18.650
capacitance of any one.

03:18.690 --> 03:27.090
Well again now the rule for parallel capacitors is the equivalent one is equal to see one plus C two

03:27.170 --> 03:31.890
make it different from the resistor equivalent resistance formula.

03:32.300 --> 03:32.570
OK.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.390
It's actually the opposite.

03:34.570 --> 03:41.100
Okay so actually in this case here if I have two of them in parallel the equivalent I can replace that

03:41.100 --> 03:45.920
by one equivalent capacitor which ends up being bigger.

03:45.990 --> 03:50.600
It acts like a bigger capacitor and the value here is equivalent.

03:50.820 --> 03:52.250
So it's not going to be less.

03:53.010 --> 03:54.140
That's kind of the problem with that.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.890
So that was false.

03:55.890 --> 03:56.580
What's this.

03:56.580 --> 04:01.860
The capacitor with the largest capacitance has the largest potential difference across it.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.410
Oh no.

04:03.450 --> 04:06.510
Because we just said it's going to be the same for each one.

04:06.600 --> 04:11.820
The voltage is going to be the same it doesn't matter on the value of c be a little bit careful that

04:11.820 --> 04:18.410
one and the last one choice e the capacitor with the largest capacitance has the most charge.

04:19.000 --> 04:19.750
Oh yeah.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.580
We just argued here from our using our charge equation.

04:23.760 --> 04:25.160
So this one is also true.

04:25.170 --> 04:27.780
So we have two correct choices there choice and choice.

04:27.780 --> 04:28.870
You're both correct.

04:29.940 --> 04:36.860
Here's problem 15 we have a tiny particle that has this magnitude it's initially moving at 55 meters

04:36.870 --> 04:37.980
per second.

04:37.980 --> 04:42.240
It's then accelerated through a potential difference of 500 volts.

04:42.240 --> 04:48.700
How much kinetic energy does this particle gain during this period of acceleration.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.400
All right well I would kind of draw it.

04:50.460 --> 04:52.690
I think so.

04:52.800 --> 04:57.210
Whatever the voltage is the only thing I know is that there is a difference of voltage which is equal

04:57.210 --> 04:59.530
to 500 volts.

05:01.350 --> 05:02.780
So what else do we know.

05:02.820 --> 05:10.890
We have a tiny particle here that is plus five micro cool and initially has some speeds.

05:10.920 --> 05:15.960
I don't know let's just kind of have it over here and it's emotionally moving like this at fifty five

05:16.680 --> 05:18.080
meters per second.

05:18.150 --> 05:24.960
The magnitude of the charge q is five times 10 to the negative 6 micro Coolum.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.480
All right let me just for just her.

05:27.480 --> 05:34.050
This problem here I imagine this guy here was going to be plus 250 then this guy was gonna be minus

05:34.050 --> 05:36.750
250 volts all right just for a comparison here.

05:37.260 --> 05:43.320
So what's going to happen while there is AK an electric field here and a positive charge wants to get

05:43.320 --> 05:45.900
away from this one and wants to go toward this one.

05:46.020 --> 05:46.220
Right.

05:46.230 --> 05:48.020
So there is a force acting on it.

05:48.390 --> 05:51.460
However we want to know how much kinetic energy does it gain.

05:51.480 --> 05:57.660
So it has some initial kinetic energy here but the question is asking for what is the change of kinetic

05:57.660 --> 05:59.250
energy.

05:59.250 --> 06:04.410
All right there's going to be a change of kinetic energy because there's going to be a change of potential

06:04.410 --> 06:05.160
energy.

06:05.400 --> 06:11.520
Right here there's a lot of potential energy right here there is less potential energy so that's why

06:11.520 --> 06:15.330
there is this change so the total energy has to be conserved.

06:15.330 --> 06:21.570
If you think about it here we have some initial kinetic energy plus some initial potential energy and

06:21.570 --> 06:27.060
this here's the final position so we're gonna have some final plus some final.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.760
What we're looking for is the change.

06:30.790 --> 06:31.050
OK.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.730
So again all of this here has to be the same.

06:33.730 --> 06:35.070
So let me do all the math over here.

06:35.070 --> 06:42.450
So we have our initial plus my initial has to be my final plus my final.

06:42.450 --> 06:47.800
All right let's group together the kinetic energies I'll put them all on the right hand side here.

06:47.820 --> 06:54.300
So this is K final minus K initial so this is really the change of kinetic energy.

06:54.330 --> 06:58.670
This is really what we're looking for that's going to be how much it's going to gain.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.170
So this is going to be you initial minus you final.

07:02.540 --> 07:02.970
OK.

07:02.980 --> 07:07.230
Now if you think about this expression here we want to write the change.

07:07.260 --> 07:14.250
This is negative the change in terms of the voltage but at any point I could write down just clean this

07:14.250 --> 07:15.760
up for a second here.

07:15.990 --> 07:22.350
At any point what I could do is I can write down the potential energy in terms of the potential right.

07:22.380 --> 07:29.620
So the potential energy initial will be the initial or the charge multiplied by the initial voltage

07:30.400 --> 07:36.930
minus the final potential energy is that charge q multiplied by the final voltage.

07:37.250 --> 07:43.330
And this here's the change of kinetic energy at the end here if you can factor this out what you're

07:43.330 --> 07:51.350
going to end up getting right here is v initial minus V final equals to my change of kinetic energy.

07:51.460 --> 07:58.930
And here this is exactly what we need right because this here is simply going to be the 250 minus the

07:58.930 --> 08:00.010
250.

08:00.090 --> 08:00.360
OK.

08:00.390 --> 08:04.480
This guy right here in the bracket has to be five hundred volts.

08:04.870 --> 08:08.500
This guy here is my 5 micro cool.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.090
That's the charge.

08:10.090 --> 08:16.390
So at the end you end up getting that the change of kinetic energy is the charge five times ten to the

08:16.390 --> 08:23.100
negative six multiplied by again this change of voltage which is five hundred volts.

08:23.550 --> 08:29.890
All right if you multiply that out at the end you should get this answer right here choice B OK it would

08:29.890 --> 08:34.390
be the correct answer this problem's probably a little bit harder for you but hopefully you were able

08:34.390 --> 08:35.650
to kind of argue like this.

08:35.650 --> 08:40.300
Use conservation of energy again because we're looking for the kinetic energy here

08:43.230 --> 08:51.030
here's problem 16 says how much work must we do on an electron to move it from this initial position

08:51.060 --> 08:56.100
to the final position along this semi circular path.

08:56.310 --> 09:00.810
Assume that the system is isolated from anything else and here we have the numerical value so it looks

09:00.810 --> 09:06.000
like we have to do a calculation the first thing to notice about this one is it doesn't matter on the

09:06.000 --> 09:07.150
path right.

09:07.320 --> 09:15.350
We talked about this in the class this is path independent so it really only matters where you start

09:15.530 --> 09:20.000
and where you finish so you start here and we're going to finish down over here.

09:20.090 --> 09:21.460
So that's all that matters.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.570
I could take it along any path I want.

09:23.570 --> 09:27.350
It really doesn't matter can take it around here and end it over there.

09:27.350 --> 09:30.410
OK so the path doesn't matter.

09:30.530 --> 09:37.090
So now we want to calculate the work done by a person or someone who's going to move the electron the

09:37.090 --> 09:39.080
electrons are actually quite happy to be here.

09:39.260 --> 09:46.880
Let me draw the electron right here and here's a negative charge one point six 10 of the negative 19

09:46.880 --> 09:47.300
right.

09:47.330 --> 09:50.510
It's very happy to be close to this positive charge right here.

09:50.510 --> 09:53.470
This is a positive charge and this is a negative charge.

09:53.780 --> 09:59.210
If you think about the forces involved right when the electron is kind of say midway I just draw right

09:59.210 --> 10:01.300
here again it doesn't matter on the path.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.870
So when it's right here.

10:03.320 --> 10:07.320
Well somebody has to apply a force like this.

10:07.370 --> 10:12.740
This is my applied force because there is a electric force acting opposite of that right.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.870
The electron wants to go this way.

10:14.940 --> 10:15.170
All right.

10:15.170 --> 10:16.880
This is the cool Ohm's Law force.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.620
This is the electric force acting on the electron.

10:20.720 --> 10:27.980
So if you remember the work of equation the work done by the electric field guy.

10:28.010 --> 10:30.510
This is electric field.

10:30.770 --> 10:34.720
This is very easy to calculate because it's a conservative force.

10:34.910 --> 10:39.170
It's equal to negative the change in potential energy.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.520
So let's go ahead and do this.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.070
So this is negative.

10:42.080 --> 10:45.720
Now we know the potential where we start and where we finished.

10:45.720 --> 10:51.350
So you can always write this is negative Q multiplied by the change in voltage.

10:51.540 --> 10:56.450
So this is minus Q And this is v final minus V initial.

10:56.470 --> 10:56.620
Okay.

10:56.630 --> 10:59.230
This is really just a matter of plugging everything in.

10:59.240 --> 11:05.420
So we have minus what is the charge of the electron now what's negative one point six times ten to the

11:05.420 --> 11:07.200
negative 19.

11:07.430 --> 11:11.720
And what is the change of voltage while v final here is minus 50.

11:11.720 --> 11:18.150
You gotta be careful with all these negative signs and minus V initial the initial is 50.

11:18.380 --> 11:18.710
All right.

11:18.710 --> 11:23.630
So you get a think about all the negative signs here you get actually three negative signs here you're

11:23.630 --> 11:27.170
gonna get negative one hundred for everything here in the bracket.

11:27.170 --> 11:34.610
The second bracket that's negative one hundred volts and both of those at the end the final answer you'll

11:34.610 --> 11:40.490
get is going to be negative and this is one point six times 10 to the negative 17 and this is measured

11:40.490 --> 11:50.320
in Joules so this is the work done by the electric field so first of all we notice that it is negative.

11:50.570 --> 11:55.250
And the reason that it's negative again if you consider an electron moving from this position to that

11:55.250 --> 11:59.350
one the electric force is acting to the left.

12:00.050 --> 12:02.450
But what is the direction of the displacement.

12:02.630 --> 12:08.540
My net displacement is that way right.

12:08.560 --> 12:14.680
And the force the electric force anyway is this way.

12:14.950 --> 12:19.260
So that's why we get a negative value for the work done by the field.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.820
Now the work done by me.

12:20.830 --> 12:22.830
That's what we're asking for right here.

12:22.900 --> 12:28.300
The work done by this applied force is always going to be opposite of the work done by the electric

12:28.300 --> 12:31.120
force.

12:31.640 --> 12:37.580
So in this case really we have to do positive work of one point six times ten to the negative seven

12:37.760 --> 12:45.030
seventeen not nineteen seventeen jewels joules again my work is going to be positive even if you go

12:45.030 --> 12:52.350
along the circular path because the forces that I'm applying is going to be like this and the displacement

12:52.350 --> 12:54.930
is also along the same direction.

12:54.930 --> 13:00.660
So when you have a force in a displacement that are in the same direction what you end up getting is

13:00.660 --> 13:02.230
positive work.

13:02.880 --> 13:10.220
And again I do positive work because I'm storing I'm putting energy into the system.

13:10.230 --> 13:12.170
The electron doesn't want to do like this.

13:12.170 --> 13:12.390
Right.

13:12.390 --> 13:17.010
I am storing potential energy into the system

13:23.720 --> 13:29.960
for example if I let that electron go once I'm over here it's going to shoot back on the other side.

13:30.260 --> 13:35.760
That's because I've put a lot of potential energy into the system by doing some work.

13:35.810 --> 13:36.150
All right.

13:36.170 --> 13:38.700
So all of that to say that B is the correct answer.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.390
You've got to be careful with the signs here.
