WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:06.830
Here we have a uniform electric fuel with magnitude given by this six times ten of the six newtons per

00:06.840 --> 00:14.640
Coolum is directed along the x axis a cube having an edge of zero point one metres is oriented as shown

00:14.640 --> 00:15.570
in the figure.

00:15.690 --> 00:20.520
WHAT IS THE ELECTRIC FLUX passing through the shaded area right here.

00:20.520 --> 00:20.770
ALL RIGHT.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.920
SO HOW DO WE FIND THE ELECTRIC FLUX here.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.640
Just going through this area right here.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.770
Given the dimensions of everything and the electric field.

00:29.820 --> 00:35.700
So again if you consider the electric field here is in the positive x axis or fields should be going

00:35.700 --> 00:37.270
directly like this.

00:37.320 --> 00:43.890
We also would have liked the area the normal to the area the vector that's perpendicular IS ALSO LIKE

00:43.890 --> 00:44.790
THIS.

00:45.030 --> 00:45.270
ALL RIGHT.

00:45.300 --> 00:51.450
SO IF YOU REMEMBER THE DEFINITION OF THE ELECTRIC FLUX it would be the for a constant field anyway it's

00:51.450 --> 00:57.720
the magnitude of the field the magnitude of the area and coast of the angle between the electric field

00:58.260 --> 01:00.990
and the vector that's perpendicular to the area.

01:01.050 --> 01:07.260
In this case here the theta is equal to zero degrees so coast of zero equals to one.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.100
So we don't have to worry about this.

01:09.150 --> 01:14.700
So our electric flux reduces the simply the field magnitude multiplied by the area.

01:14.730 --> 01:16.330
So this is pretty easy.

01:16.590 --> 01:21.120
Field MAGNITUDE IS SIX TIMES 10 TO THE 6 in the area.

01:21.120 --> 01:28.180
Again it's a square and the side is zero point one so you have to square that thing.

01:28.320 --> 01:33.420
So again six times tend to the six I don't even need a calculator for this one this is zero point zero

01:33.420 --> 01:41.790
one at the annual SHOULD GET SIX TIMES 10 TO THE FOUR.

01:41.810 --> 01:47.150
OKAY SO THE CORRECT ANSWER FOR THIS ONE LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE choice B.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.500
So nothing too difficult about this problem.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.770
Hopefully you got that one all right.

01:51.770 --> 01:58.130
Question 10 says we have two tiny particles having these charges over here they're separated by 20 centimeters.

01:58.160 --> 02:03.930
What are the magnitudes and direction of the electric field midway between the charges.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.000
All right so let's go ahead and draw them out.

02:06.020 --> 02:14.480
So we have a 20 micro Coolum charge 20 micro cool on and then we're going to have a negative 8 micro

02:14.480 --> 02:15.260
Coolum.

02:15.350 --> 02:19.170
Put this one here and this is negative 8 micro cool.

02:19.280 --> 02:25.610
And what we want to know is at the midway between them they're separated by 20 centimeters.

02:25.790 --> 02:29.900
So that's this distance right here I'm going to put that right in meters right away that zero point

02:29.900 --> 02:31.400
two meters.

02:31.400 --> 02:36.020
What we want to know here is right here at the midpoint what is the electric field right here at this

02:36.020 --> 02:37.150
point.

02:37.190 --> 02:42.530
So first thing we have to figure out is where there's going to be two contributions to the electric

02:42.530 --> 02:43.500
field.

02:43.540 --> 02:47.410
There is the electric field produced by the positive one which is like this.

02:47.420 --> 02:55.910
This here has a magnitude let's call it E E 1 and the negative charge also produces an electric field.

02:55.910 --> 02:59.930
And again we're going to call it's magnitude E 2.

02:59.930 --> 03:05.030
At the end we have to add them up as vectors since they're in the same direction we simply have to add

03:05.030 --> 03:05.860
them up.

03:05.870 --> 03:11.870
One thing we could do right away is that if you look at all these choices some of them say it's directed

03:11.870 --> 03:16.270
toward the positive charge so it can't be anything directed toward the positive charge.

03:16.340 --> 03:19.180
It has to be directed toward the negative charge.

03:19.220 --> 03:19.420
All right.

03:19.430 --> 03:22.380
So let's eliminate choice to be in choice D right away.

03:22.580 --> 03:24.590
And now we're left with different magnitude.

03:24.590 --> 03:28.910
So now we have to be a little bit more careful rights either tend to the fourth end of the five or ten

03:28.910 --> 03:30.130
to the six.

03:30.130 --> 03:34.070
So let's go ahead and look at the magnitudes of each one of those things.

03:34.100 --> 03:34.400
All right.

03:34.430 --> 03:42.290
So E one right here is going to be k q and divided by the distance.

03:42.290 --> 03:46.940
Now the distance is zero point one squared.

03:47.120 --> 03:47.510
All right.

03:47.510 --> 03:58.520
And e to is going to be k its charge here is going to be so let's just call it Q2 and again the distance

03:58.520 --> 04:00.630
is still zero point one squared.

04:00.650 --> 04:05.510
Let's go ahead and substitute in all our numbers here nine times 10 to the nine is for the K value.

04:05.600 --> 04:11.460
This charge is 20 micro cooldown times tend to the negative 6.

04:11.990 --> 04:15.920
And all of this divided by zero point one squared.

04:15.920 --> 04:20.810
All right so be a little bit careful when you plug that in your calculator for the negative charge you

04:20.810 --> 04:21.440
have.

04:22.040 --> 04:28.580
Whoops just said Let's substitute our numbers so we get nine times ten to the nine for our constant

04:28.580 --> 04:29.210
k.

04:29.300 --> 04:34.520
The magnitude of this charge is eight times tend to the negative six.

04:34.520 --> 04:39.920
And now how far is it away from that charge the point where we're evaluating the field is zero point

04:39.920 --> 04:41.410
one meter.

04:41.630 --> 04:41.900
All right.

04:41.900 --> 04:45.460
At the end what you have to do here is you have to add both of those up.

04:45.470 --> 04:49.700
So we have to take calculate those numbers and add them up.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.130
All right.

04:50.150 --> 04:53.500
Now I'm going to let you kind of go ahead and do that at the end.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.660
If you do it correctly.

04:54.690 --> 04:56.660
Let me check my answers right here.

04:56.660 --> 05:01.480
I think I obtain an answer which was a 10 to the six.

05:01.480 --> 05:09.080
All right it's over 10 if you do careful here at the end e total is equal to the magnitude of each one

05:09.080 --> 05:11.070
plus the magnitude of E two.

05:11.090 --> 05:11.380
OK.

05:11.390 --> 05:15.490
Which gives me twenty five point two times ten of the six.

05:15.500 --> 05:19.410
And that's measured and nuanced per Pakula that's our magnitude.

05:19.430 --> 05:19.680
All right.

05:19.740 --> 05:24.860
But those are the basic steps into getting to that answer all right.

05:24.870 --> 05:26.200
Here's number 11.

05:26.300 --> 05:32.300
The end of the electrical potential in this case OK electrical potential a distance of 4 meters from

05:32.300 --> 05:35.830
a certain point charges to 200 volts.

05:35.870 --> 05:40.640
What is the potential at a distance of two meters from the same charge.

05:40.640 --> 05:40.940
All right.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.770
So let me kind of draw this one out here.

05:42.770 --> 05:47.960
So we have oh let's get rid of that maybe use this.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.070
All right let's draw a positive chart.

05:50.080 --> 05:56.270
I know it's positive because it's 200 volts and I'm going to be a certain distance of four meters away.

05:56.270 --> 06:02.180
So let me draw kind of point over here that's four meters away.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.010
I don't know exactly where that is.

06:04.010 --> 06:09.850
So really could be kind of anywhere on this sphere that is four meters away.

06:09.950 --> 06:10.520
Right.

06:10.550 --> 06:16.730
That the potential everywhere here is two hundred volts and the formula you would use to calculate this

06:16.730 --> 06:25.310
would be that the potential V from the point charge it would be k q divided by the distance in this

06:25.310 --> 06:32.550
case it's the distance are so hours for what is the potential now if you're only two meters away.

06:32.600 --> 06:38.710
So what if you cut that distance in half what happens okay.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.640
Well if you think about it now.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.310
So when you're four right here.

06:42.310 --> 06:47.350
So if I make the distance smaller I should have a higher electrical potential.

06:47.380 --> 06:48.340
Okay.

06:48.400 --> 06:53.740
And again if the distance now is two instead of keeping everything else the same which you would have

06:53.740 --> 07:01.340
is the potential would be k q the same K the same Q And the distance now is are over two.

07:01.360 --> 07:10.540
So it really be two times k q over R and this guy here in the bracket is what we call two hundred volts.

07:10.540 --> 07:16.900
So in this case here you'd have to have four hundred volts so the potential gets bigger as I go closer.

07:16.900 --> 07:17.260
Okay.

07:17.270 --> 07:24.760
And for this case here going from two meters to four meters I doubling the distance in this case the

07:24.760 --> 07:27.750
potential goes down by a factor of two.

07:27.790 --> 07:30.300
So we have to have 400 volts.

07:30.920 --> 07:37.480
I would have probably eliminated choice B right away and a whole so choice D I would have probably also

07:37.480 --> 07:42.070
eliminated choice a the potential is not going to stay the same because it's produced by a point charge

07:42.550 --> 07:46.800
and it's not going to get smaller because I'm getting closer to that charge.

07:46.810 --> 07:51.250
So I would have been left with only two choices and then doing a little bit of math would have got me

07:51.250 --> 07:52.110
to the right answer.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.550
So sees the right answer here.

07:54.760 --> 07:55.090
All right.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.540
So let's have a look in number 12.

07:56.530 --> 08:03.610
We have two protons are fired toward each other in a particle accelerator with only the electrostatic

08:03.610 --> 08:10.020
force acting which of the following statements must be true as they move closer together.

08:10.400 --> 08:10.650
OK.

08:10.660 --> 08:11.980
There could be more than one answer.

08:11.990 --> 08:13.240
So let's kind of draw it out here.

08:13.250 --> 08:16.090
Imagine when they're really far away.

08:16.090 --> 08:21.070
So there's a force acting on them it's repulsive right the force might look something like this might

08:21.070 --> 08:22.150
look something like this.

08:22.150 --> 08:23.160
That's the force.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.790
What else.

08:24.790 --> 08:28.500
They're probably moving at a certain speed.

08:28.500 --> 08:28.840
All right.

08:30.190 --> 08:35.920
So what's happening to that speed as they get closer as they get closer and maybe eventually they might

08:36.100 --> 08:38.020
be something like this.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.670
How would you draw the force in this case.

08:39.670 --> 08:44.120
I think I would draw a bigger right because the distance is smaller.

08:45.270 --> 08:50.920
They're probably slowing down so I don't know maybe make the velocity a little bit smaller.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.220
There might be a point where they get close.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.150
They don't quite touch.

08:54.160 --> 08:57.060
They get to zero and then they start going back.

08:57.100 --> 08:57.360
All right.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.070
So let's have a look at some of these choices here.

09:00.120 --> 09:04.410
There are electrical potential energy Kipps keeps increasing.

09:04.510 --> 09:07.960
So do we have more potential energy over here.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.420
Well think about it in terms of kinetic and electrical potential.

09:11.570 --> 09:11.920
OK.

09:11.950 --> 09:14.950
So this is really the two forms of energy that we have.

09:14.950 --> 09:20.340
We have kinetic plus potential right over here and the first step.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.260
We have a lot of kinetic energy.

09:23.350 --> 09:26.040
So we have a small potential energy.

09:26.170 --> 09:30.660
So what happens as they get closer the kinetic energy gets smaller.

09:30.670 --> 09:36.530
So the potential energy has to go up because the total energy is conserved.

09:37.140 --> 09:40.390
So yeah that wouldn't make sense to me.

09:40.390 --> 09:41.500
What else.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.700
Their kinetic energy keeps increasing.

09:43.690 --> 09:44.870
Well no that's not true right.

09:44.890 --> 09:46.610
Because they're slowing down.

09:46.630 --> 09:46.950
Right.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.660
Because there's a force acting in the opposite direction.

09:50.690 --> 09:53.770
There are electrical potential energy keeps decreasing on No.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.390
That can't be because we just said the kinetic energy gets smaller.

09:58.390 --> 10:05.230
So that has to come at the expense of the electrostatic potential energy their kinetic energy keeps

10:05.230 --> 10:06.130
decreasing.

10:06.130 --> 10:06.480
Yes.

10:06.490 --> 10:07.810
This one here makes sense.

10:07.810 --> 10:10.760
So we have a That's good we have d That's good.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.640
Their acceleration keeps decreasing.

10:13.740 --> 10:14.010
OK.

10:14.020 --> 10:19.880
Why when I read the word acceleration I immediately think about the force is the force getting smaller

10:19.880 --> 10:21.780
or is the force getting bigger.

10:21.780 --> 10:22.030
All right.

10:22.030 --> 10:25.990
We just said here force gets bigger.

10:26.050 --> 10:26.380
All right.

10:27.520 --> 10:34.780
And the way we argue that is just by using cool Ohm's law it's the same charges but the distance between

10:34.780 --> 10:36.250
them is getting smaller.

10:36.280 --> 10:43.630
So if I divide by a small number I'm going to get a larger force larger force means larger acceleration.

10:43.630 --> 10:44.270
All right.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.600
So a India the correct answers for this one.
