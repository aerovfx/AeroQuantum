Hi everybody physics ninja here today I want to look at the potential the potential v that's created

00:05.550 --> 00:07.370
from a charge disk.

00:07.440 --> 00:12.570
So yeah I have a disk and I've placed the disk in the x y plane what I'm going to do that this is I'm

00:12.570 --> 00:15.250
going to give it a uniform charge distribution.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.160
So that's the Sigma over here.

00:17.160 --> 00:23.400
And again this is going to be a constant charge distribution or we want to do now is I want to go above

00:23.400 --> 00:27.610
this desk a certain distance in this case it's going to be denoted by the letter Z.

00:27.810 --> 00:33.710
What I want to do is I want to calculate what is the potential V right here at this point.

00:33.890 --> 00:34.060
Right.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.470
And what happens then in the limit.

00:35.490 --> 00:38.670
What happens at that point is very very far away from the disk.

00:38.670 --> 00:41.740
What happens if it's very close to the disk.

00:41.760 --> 00:42.690
What else can we calculate.

00:42.690 --> 00:48.840
If I know the potential as a function of that letter Z I can also calculate what the electric field

00:48.840 --> 00:49.450
is.

00:49.470 --> 00:54.180
So what is the field when I'm close to this plate or if I'm very very far away from that plate.

00:54.210 --> 00:56.100
So it's kind of a nice problem.

00:56.100 --> 01:00.940
It's going to involve some integration because I have a uniform charge distribution.

01:01.080 --> 01:05.400
So we're going to start by setting that up and then do all the rest of the calculations.

01:05.440 --> 01:05.680
Okay.

01:05.700 --> 01:10.200
So to get started when I'm first going to do is I'm going to consider a tiny little patch right here

01:10.200 --> 01:15.870
in this little patch here has a charge which I'm going to denote as D Q some infinitesimal amount of

01:15.870 --> 01:17.120
charge.

01:17.310 --> 01:22.770
And I want to evaluate its contribution to the electrical potential at this point here point P which

01:22.770 --> 01:27.620
is a high Z above this disk is disk allies in the x y plane.

01:27.660 --> 01:31.580
Let's go ahead and just write this as that distance over here.

01:31.650 --> 01:38.680
Now we have to define one more thing the distance now from the origin all the way to where this charges.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.160
Let's call that our Prime Now.

01:42.190 --> 01:46.450
You should be able to write that the distance from this little charge all the way to that point.

01:46.450 --> 01:48.810
This is just using Pythagorean.

01:49.150 --> 01:53.530
Nothing too complicated here it's our prime squared and plus Z squared.

01:54.960 --> 01:55.500
All right.

01:55.620 --> 02:00.720
Now we should be able to write an expression now for the potential produced by this little bit of charge

02:00.720 --> 02:06.000
and I call that an infinitesimal potential because it's only the contribution from this little charge

02:06.000 --> 02:06.640
at the end.

02:06.750 --> 02:10.650
You'll have to integrate in order to get the total contribution.

02:10.680 --> 02:17.010
So again this is simply D Q divided by four pi Epsilon 0 and the distance.

02:17.010 --> 02:23.580
It's always the distance away from the charge to the point where I'm evaluating the so that distance

02:23.820 --> 02:27.630
is what we just obtain helps get rid of that.

02:27.630 --> 02:29.790
This is our prime squared.

02:29.790 --> 02:31.200
And again plus Z squared.

02:32.460 --> 02:32.720
All right.

02:32.730 --> 02:34.000
So that's it.

02:34.050 --> 02:34.890
It looks like that's it.

02:34.890 --> 02:40.030
The only thing I have to do now is I have to add all the contributions so we have to do one more step

02:40.030 --> 02:40.240
here.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.490
What is this little element of charge.

02:42.490 --> 02:47.650
Well there's a little element of charge is going to be my charge density multiplied by the area.

02:48.120 --> 02:50.670
So let's take this equation one step further.

02:50.680 --> 03:00.220
This is my charged my charge density and multiplied by the area call it D.A. and again the bottom now

03:00.220 --> 03:03.770
is just stays the exact same for Pi Epsilon 0.

03:03.850 --> 03:08.800
And again square root of the rest of this term are prime squared plus Z squared.

03:10.110 --> 03:14.700
Okay to get the total potential which is really what I'm after to get the total potential what you have

03:14.700 --> 03:20.880
to do now is we have to integrate and we're gonna have to integrate the expressions like this in order

03:20.880 --> 03:27.610
to add up all the contributions to get the total potential and that here is only going to be a function

03:27.610 --> 03:30.040
of Z for this particular problem.

03:30.040 --> 03:30.320
Okay.

03:30.340 --> 03:35.770
So let's evaluate this integral we're doing we're working in cylindrical coordinate systems so the potential

03:36.430 --> 03:38.070
as a function of V.

03:38.080 --> 03:44.470
Let's take out all the constant term so you should have a charge density which pops out the other terms

03:44.470 --> 03:48.340
that pop out are gonna be this for Pi the Epsilon 0.

03:48.370 --> 03:50.200
Now I could write out the integral.

03:50.200 --> 03:55.660
Now there's two integrals because I'm integrating over the total area of this disk and in cylindrical

03:55.660 --> 03:58.180
coordinates the integral goes from 0 to 2 pi.

03:58.840 --> 04:01.150
That's for the angle theta.

04:01.150 --> 04:08.080
And I also want to integrate over the total radius so that I'll go from zero all the way to uppercase

04:08.100 --> 04:08.350
R.

04:08.380 --> 04:12.840
That's the radius of this disk and that's it.

04:12.850 --> 04:20.110
Now here I'm going to replace this little element of area again the little element of area for the cylindrical

04:20.110 --> 04:25.150
coordinates can always be written as our prime D.R. prime.

04:25.150 --> 04:27.810
And again I've already got the D theta here.

04:28.150 --> 04:35.120
So maybe let me just explicitly write this down here that the area can also be written as D.R. times

04:35.120 --> 04:38.160
are prime and multiplied by D theta.

04:38.180 --> 04:38.410
Okay.

04:38.420 --> 04:44.970
That's where this whole substitution over here came in so don't worry about that.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.570
And again at the end we're still left with this term here in the denominator in the denominator.

04:49.570 --> 04:57.250
I still have this square root term which is our prime squared and plus Z squared.

04:57.310 --> 04:59.890
Okay so this looks like a nasty expression.

05:00.160 --> 05:05.050
The first term however this is pretty straightforward since there is no other dependents on the angle

05:05.050 --> 05:06.970
theta over here.

05:07.030 --> 05:11.850
The integral from 0 to 2 pi of D theta simply gives me 2 pi.

05:11.980 --> 05:13.920
So let's go ahead and simplify this even more

05:16.690 --> 05:19.690
so we get our charged distribution sigma.

05:19.690 --> 05:27.060
We get the 4 pi Epsilon 0 this first integral let's just write is this this is going to be 2 pi.

05:27.400 --> 05:30.600
And now the final integral will go in the next page in just a second here.

05:30.610 --> 05:32.770
But this is really at the heart of the problem.

05:35.170 --> 05:40.830
The square root of our prime squared plus Z squared.

05:40.830 --> 05:47.770
Notice you can cancel out 2 pi and cancel out your left with a 2 here at the bottom.

05:47.840 --> 05:51.890
Okay so now let's go on the next page and I'll show you how to evaluate this second term over here.

05:51.890 --> 05:58.250
The second integral over the total radius to get our final expression for the potential All right.

05:58.250 --> 06:02.690
So to evaluate the second term here what you have to do is you can either look it up in an integral

06:02.690 --> 06:03.710
table.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.300
This one is actually pretty straightforward.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.520
We could do just this substitution.

06:07.520 --> 06:15.570
I'm going to do a substitution or I'm going to define you as our prime squared plus Z squared.

06:15.600 --> 06:22.090
Now if I make that substitution that means that the limits now of the integral have to change right

06:22.170 --> 06:27.390
instead of going from 0 to are the limits the new limits here are going to be while the lower limit

06:27.390 --> 06:33.250
is you substitute the zero for the R prime so you have Z squared and the upper limit is you're going

06:33.250 --> 06:37.470
to have uppercase r squared plus Z squared.

06:37.470 --> 06:39.580
So those are our new limits of integration.

06:39.710 --> 06:43.530
Now the other thing I have to do now is I have to differentiate this.

06:43.530 --> 06:48.840
That means that do you mind if I differentiate that with respect to r what you end up getting here the

06:48.840 --> 06:54.300
second term is is just acts as a constant because I'm not differentiating with respect to the letter

06:54.300 --> 06:55.040
Z.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.280
What you're left with here is simply to our prime.

06:59.280 --> 07:05.580
Now that doesn't quite look like the top term so we have to just rearrange it a little bit if you rearrange

07:05.580 --> 07:13.360
a little bit what you're going to find here is that if I have our prime D.R. prime.

07:13.360 --> 07:17.000
That should be equal to D you over too.

07:17.020 --> 07:24.580
OK so now we go ahead and we make the substitution and this is what you should end up with that my potential.

07:24.580 --> 07:27.890
At least the integral can be written as the first terms don't change.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.920
These are only constant terms.

07:29.920 --> 07:35.230
Now I'm changing I've made a change of variable over here so what I'm changing now is I'm going to integrate

07:35.770 --> 07:41.340
all the way from Z squared all the way to our squared plus Z squared.

07:42.830 --> 07:43.100
Okay.

07:43.110 --> 07:46.260
Now we make these substitution for all of these terms over here.

07:46.360 --> 07:54.270
So the are prime D.R. prime Well that gets substituted by this guy right here.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.820
So that simply becomes do you divide it by two.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.210
All right.

07:58.210 --> 08:02.960
Now here I'm still dividing by the square root of this term.

08:03.370 --> 08:05.270
And now one term is pretty easy.

08:05.530 --> 08:07.990
So I'm gonna have the square root of you.

08:08.230 --> 08:08.590
OK.

08:09.010 --> 08:14.110
Now this is getting pretty straightforward now actually this integral right here is one that's pretty

08:14.110 --> 08:15.130
straightforward.

08:15.190 --> 08:20.050
So let's go on the other page and evaluate this and get to our final expression for the potential.

08:20.280 --> 08:20.530
OK.

08:20.560 --> 08:25.150
So this is pretty straightforward at this point all we have to do is maybe pull out the to bring that

08:25.150 --> 08:29.350
to the front and then we're left with a very very simple in a row.

08:29.360 --> 08:36.580
But let me just do one intermediate step for you over for Epsilon 0.

08:36.770 --> 08:40.470
Again this are still going to be the same limits I'm not going to rewrite them over here.

08:40.620 --> 08:44.680
And what you're left with here is d you divided by square root of you.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.730
And that term is pretty straightforward All right.

08:47.740 --> 08:53.710
I always like to write it off for me my personal preference here is just the right it is you to the

08:53.710 --> 08:55.170
minus one half right.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.150
That's exactly what this term is.

08:57.250 --> 09:00.470
And the integral now with respect to do you.

09:00.580 --> 09:00.870
All right.

09:00.970 --> 09:03.130
So this you should be able to just write this down.

09:03.190 --> 09:03.370
Right.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.560
This is kind of a standard function so we get over for Epsilon 0.

09:09.280 --> 09:09.550
All right.

09:09.560 --> 09:13.170
Now this guy here is again you add 1.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.630
So we're going to have you to the.

09:15.640 --> 09:22.360
If you add one to negative 1 1/2 you're left with one 1/2 and you also have to divide by that term by

09:22.360 --> 09:23.080
the same term.

09:23.260 --> 09:31.180
So we get this and again this is evaluated now between the limits of Z squared and r squared plus Z

09:31.180 --> 09:32.430
squared.

09:32.500 --> 09:38.710
So all we have to do now is simply substitute those limits into this expression and we'll have our final

09:38.710 --> 09:44.520
expression for the potential one thing I could simplify over here this too can cancel out.

09:44.530 --> 09:47.270
I could take two out of there and I'm left with this.

09:47.440 --> 09:47.680
All right.

09:47.680 --> 09:48.530
One last step.

09:48.550 --> 09:49.860
We get to our final expression.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.890
Let's do it so I'm left with.

09:52.890 --> 09:59.170
Now just substituting those limits Sigma over to Epsilon 0 remains the same.

09:59.250 --> 10:04.500
Now again if you substitute our squared Plaza squared into here and write it in kind of a slightly different

10:04.500 --> 10:08.040
form over here let's write that one half as a square root.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.820
And here I am left with our squared plus Z squared.

10:11.430 --> 10:13.620
So it depends on how far away you are.

10:13.620 --> 10:13.800
All right.

10:13.800 --> 10:19.180
That makes sense and also on the dimensions of the disk that almost also makes sense.

10:19.350 --> 10:25.120
And don't forget to substitute this lower limit here because we did a change of variable over here.

10:25.410 --> 10:25.670
OK.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.280
So we have something like this.

10:27.330 --> 10:31.710
The other thing you can do now is I mean you could simplify this a little bit if I wanted to factor

10:31.710 --> 10:32.610
out a Z.

10:32.730 --> 10:33.510
I could do that.

10:33.670 --> 10:40.170
So let's go ahead here and that would look like Sigma over to Epsilon 0.

10:40.170 --> 10:45.780
Now if you take out a z over here again imagine the Z is above the desk or if it's below the disk you're

10:45.780 --> 10:47.750
going to get the same potential.

10:47.830 --> 10:48.060
Right.

10:48.060 --> 10:52.380
It's going to be some positive value of the potential and you could see that this is always going to

10:52.380 --> 10:55.590
be a positive value right.

10:55.620 --> 10:59.720
There is nothing in this term here again assuming that the charge density is positive.

10:59.730 --> 11:03.600
But this first term is always going to be bigger than the second term.

11:03.600 --> 11:08.720
All right if I factor out a Z I'm going to just going to write that as absolute value of Z.

11:09.030 --> 11:15.690
What you're left with now in the bracket is again if you factor out Z squared from the square root you'll

11:15.690 --> 11:18.800
end up have an absolute value of z over here.

11:18.810 --> 11:23.940
So the first term will look like this just change the order a little bit.

11:23.940 --> 11:29.890
This will be R over Z squared make sure you can kind of understand that step.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.500
And again this is gonna be minus one.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.700
You're going to see why in a minute that I kind of like this form over here.

11:36.700 --> 11:36.880
All right.

11:36.880 --> 11:43.680
So this is the value or a function of the potential as a function of the value z.

11:44.050 --> 11:50.130
I want to examine this this equation here on the next page and we're going to take some limits here.

11:50.140 --> 11:54.640
Like what happens if I'm really really far away from the desk and how can I use this expression for

11:54.640 --> 11:56.560
example to calculate the electric field.

11:57.040 --> 11:57.990
But we've done all the work.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.770
This is really the final expression.

11:59.770 --> 12:05.290
Let's go on the next page just to make sure this expression makes sense physically all right.

12:05.290 --> 12:10.750
So here's our expression that we've gotten this is a general expression here I haven't made any simplifications

12:10.750 --> 12:11.530
to this expression.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.750
This is just what the math gave us what the calculus gave us.

12:14.770 --> 12:18.910
So it looks like a rather complicated expression however now I want to exploit limit.

12:18.930 --> 12:24.300
It's always a good idea to explore limits when you get to algebraic expressions like this.

12:24.310 --> 12:28.390
So the first one is what happens now if I'm really really far away right.

12:28.420 --> 12:34.060
And that means what happens if Z is much much bigger than the radius.

12:34.090 --> 12:34.720
Think about it.

12:34.750 --> 12:38.590
So you have a disk in front of you and you go to a distance that's really really far away.

12:38.590 --> 12:40.990
First of all the potential should be small.

12:41.170 --> 12:44.490
And we're going to find that however how does the potential vary.

12:44.560 --> 12:49.750
If you're really really far away from a disk Well if you're really really far away from something that

12:49.750 --> 12:52.810
looks like this it probably looks like a point.

12:52.810 --> 12:57.730
So our result here which doesn't look like a point charge it should reduce to that of the point charge

12:58.600 --> 12:59.990
when I'm far away from it.

13:00.010 --> 13:03.640
So let's go ahead and make this make this verification.

13:04.030 --> 13:07.470
So when you're far away what I'm gonna do here is first look at this time.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.350
All right.

13:08.410 --> 13:14.110
If Z is bigger than R that means that this term over here that's going to end up getting squared is

13:14.110 --> 13:16.090
going to be a small term.

13:16.690 --> 13:22.060
So let's first look at what that term looks like in this limit.

13:22.180 --> 13:29.730
This term over here which is square root of 1 plus are over overseas squared.

13:29.900 --> 13:35.890
Let's get rid of this don't need that that there is approximately going to be equal to.

13:35.990 --> 13:39.160
Let me write it out as one extra step first.

13:39.170 --> 13:40.580
Some people may not know this right.

13:40.580 --> 13:44.640
This is just using kind of a binomial expansion.

13:44.720 --> 13:50.510
Let me just write as one plus R over Z again this term here is squared.

13:50.510 --> 13:56.810
And this is really to the 1 1/2 right in the limit of Z much bigger than R.

13:56.840 --> 14:05.480
This here becomes approximately equal to one plus one half are overseas squared.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.150
Now there's higher order terms but we're just going to keep those terms.

14:09.150 --> 14:14.010
Now if you completely neglected this term if you say that disease is really really big well then you

14:14.010 --> 14:18.420
might just completely get rid of this one and then you would have one under the square root minus one

14:18.420 --> 14:19.520
and that would give you zero.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.840
Well that really doesn't give you any functional dependence over here so we're gonna keep these first

14:24.840 --> 14:27.380
two terms for this expansion.

14:27.390 --> 14:30.080
All right let's have a look now of what we end up getting.

14:30.600 --> 14:38.520
So we get Sigma over to Epsilon 0 absolute value of Z and now this whole term you now the one is going

14:38.510 --> 14:45.060
to cancel with this one here again we can write out the whole square bracket but we have one plus one

14:45.060 --> 14:46.180
half.

14:46.380 --> 14:54.110
This is our squared over Z squared and minus one close the bracket.

14:54.160 --> 14:54.360
All right.

14:54.370 --> 14:56.560
This will cancel with this.

14:56.590 --> 15:02.020
Now what you're left with over here is again this too I can bring it out to the front.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.900
Let's write down all the terms over here.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.190
So we have our charge density the charge density here you can really write as the total charge.

15:09.310 --> 15:14.800
That total charge of the disk is going to be some value Q and divided by the total radius and total

15:14.800 --> 15:19.170
radius saw the total area of the disk which is simply power squared.

15:20.050 --> 15:20.320
Okay.

15:20.350 --> 15:26.080
So if you go ahead and do this let's get rid of the charge density here and write it out as Q and divided

15:26.080 --> 15:30.590
by higher squared.

15:30.600 --> 15:34.660
Now this too is going to combine this one right here.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.850
That's going to combine to a four.

15:38.070 --> 15:45.590
All right what else do we have the other terms here as I have a z up here and I have Z squared over

15:45.590 --> 15:46.360
here.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.160
So this guy here can cancel with one of those.

15:49.310 --> 15:54.560
You'll notice that the absolute values are also taking care of here in the last part here is I simply

15:54.560 --> 15:57.860
have an R squared that's left over right here.

15:58.010 --> 16:05.010
So that term has to stay and I'm also going to have just one Z here in the denominator.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.560
Notice the R squares cancel.

16:07.760 --> 16:11.540
Now if you're a little bit careful we group all the terms together what you're left with is the total

16:11.540 --> 16:19.370
charge of that disk divided by four pi and there is a Z here in the denominator and that there's the

16:19.370 --> 16:26.810
potential and that just looks exactly like the potential produced by a point charge that has a value

16:26.810 --> 16:30.460
Q and if I'm a certain distance Z away from it.

16:30.470 --> 16:34.070
So this here totally checks out right that one there makes sense physically.

16:34.460 --> 16:39.380
So when you're really really far away this whole disk just acts like a point charge and now you can

16:39.380 --> 16:42.830
also calculate the electric field and you'll get to the standard expression.

16:42.910 --> 16:48.050
All right in the second case what I want to do now is what happens now if I'm really close I'm really

16:48.050 --> 16:49.310
close to the desk again.

16:49.330 --> 16:54.640
If I look at my general expression that's OK and this limit here Z is going to be much smaller than

16:54.650 --> 16:55.760
R.

16:56.150 --> 17:00.390
I don't want to said Z equal to zero I'm just going to be above it by some small value.

17:01.230 --> 17:10.040
So that looks like well in this case here if I look at the term in the square root if Z is small that

17:10.040 --> 17:14.930
means that the second term here is going to be pretty big and it's going to be much bigger than the

17:14.930 --> 17:15.440
one.

17:15.440 --> 17:20.900
So in that case here I could just neglect the one term over here and what you're left with is that my

17:20.900 --> 17:23.510
potential is going to look like this

17:26.930 --> 17:28.030
Sesay OK.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.410
Now you can cancel out the one here forget about that term this second term is much bigger and it's

17:32.410 --> 17:38.260
squared and if that's under the square root again what we're gonna be left with here is are over ze

17:41.090 --> 17:47.590
and again minus one again that's what the square root term simplifies to and the limit that Z is much

17:47.590 --> 17:49.070
smaller than R.

17:49.120 --> 17:55.350
Now if you carry out this multiplication over here what you're left with is this term.

17:55.510 --> 18:01.270
Again I'll just multiply through by this absolute value of Z and what you're left with here is ah again

18:01.270 --> 18:06.180
minus Z she does this makes sense to you.

18:06.290 --> 18:07.730
So you have to ask yourself right.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.210
This first term here what is this first term represent.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.800
It's simply a constant term.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.810
That's actually the potential of the disk.

18:16.800 --> 18:17.230
All right.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.420
If I'm right on the desk and then what does this tell you.

18:20.420 --> 18:26.880
The second term over here tells me that it varies linearly with distance from the disk.

18:26.960 --> 18:27.140
Right.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.230
This is a linear term.

18:29.230 --> 18:30.400
And does that makes sense.

18:30.950 --> 18:35.240
Well think about it what if now if you wanted to evaluate what was the electric field.

18:35.420 --> 18:39.350
How would I evaluate the electric field if I'm really close to the disk.

18:39.440 --> 18:44.510
Right the electric field you should be the right as the derivative of the potential with respect to

18:44.510 --> 18:46.140
my variable here.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.140
Now with respect to D.C..

18:48.450 --> 18:48.670
All right.

18:48.680 --> 18:53.390
If you take the derivative and let's just assume that here we're above this desk so you don't have to

18:53.390 --> 18:57.830
really worry about the absolute value and what you end up getting here in this case would be that the

18:57.830 --> 19:03.370
electric field the first term if you differentiate it with respect to Z you get zero.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.620
This negative sign will cancel with this one right here.

19:06.710 --> 19:11.720
So that off the worry about those and if you take the derivative of Z with respect to Z you're simply

19:11.720 --> 19:18.170
going to get one in the value of the electric feel that you get is going to be Sigma divided by two

19:18.170 --> 19:21.780
Epsilon zero right.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.540
This is the electric field just above the surface of the disk.

19:25.730 --> 19:31.040
And that's exactly what you would get if you would use something called Gauss law goes as law is often

19:31.040 --> 19:36.230
used to calculate fields close to objects and you get the same result.

19:36.260 --> 19:40.730
So if we're gonna sketch now what this potential looks like again these are the results for the two

19:40.730 --> 19:41.560
limits.

19:41.660 --> 19:48.160
Far away we have a potential basically due to a point charge and Q Was the total charge of the disk

19:48.590 --> 19:53.450
when you're kind of close to the desk if you're really close to something it basically just looks like

19:53.450 --> 19:55.970
an infinite flat surface.

19:56.140 --> 19:59.440
It's not really infinite in this case it does have a finite size.

19:59.480 --> 20:06.180
So what you have here is a potential that drops linearly with distance away from the disk.

20:06.240 --> 20:06.530
Okay.

20:06.550 --> 20:11.220
And that also reduces to an electric field that's more or less constant.

20:11.260 --> 20:11.780
Right.

20:11.840 --> 20:16.750
It's very little dependence on the distance if you're close to it for the electric field.

20:16.760 --> 20:20.990
Now if we we're going to make a sketch of what V looks like as a function of distance it would look

20:21.080 --> 20:22.370
something like this.

20:22.370 --> 20:25.400
So in this first section it would be linear.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.310
And the term here has a negative slope.

20:27.320 --> 20:32.930
So it goes down and then eventually it starts kind of dropping dropping dropping.

20:33.020 --> 20:40.110
And when you're far away again it looks like one over Z one over Z down in this area right here when

20:40.110 --> 20:41.550
you're far away from it.

20:41.880 --> 20:50.600
And when you're close to adhere it's linear and the dependence is basically minus right some negative

20:50.600 --> 20:54.340
slope because it's dropping and the value right over here again.

20:54.420 --> 20:59.560
I second calculate that is simply this first term over here when Z equals zero.

20:59.690 --> 21:02.880
So the value right here is some constant value.

21:04.010 --> 21:06.480
This is basically what V.S. is.

21:06.620 --> 21:06.830
All right.

21:06.830 --> 21:12.630
So that's what the potential looks like for a finite sized disk as a function of distance from that

21:12.650 --> 21:13.530
disk.

21:13.610 --> 21:17.720
And again here I'm just doing the calculation when I'm on the axis which is the easiest case.
