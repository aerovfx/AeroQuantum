00:00.390 --> 00:00.990
Hi everybody.

00:00.990 --> 00:03.830
Physics major here today where I got a great problem for you.

00:03.840 --> 00:08.280
We're going to look at the electric field from a continuous charged distribution.

00:08.460 --> 00:11.240
So consider the wire I've got here on the whiteboard.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.580
I want to look at three specific questions.

00:13.590 --> 00:20.580
I want to find the electric field when I'm a distance x away from that wire and I've placed it kind

00:20.580 --> 00:22.800
of right at the center of the wire.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.960
Second part is I want to take that expression and I want to see what happens when I go really really

00:27.960 --> 00:29.650
far from the wire.

00:29.730 --> 00:35.070
What is the electric field look like when I'm really far from the wire and in the third case I want

00:35.070 --> 00:35.930
to see what happens.

00:35.940 --> 00:39.320
Now if I put my position right near the wire.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.780
Right when I'm really close to the wire the wire looks really really long.

00:42.810 --> 00:48.120
So we're going to look at our expression and take the right limits and see what the expression simplifies

00:48.120 --> 00:48.790
to.

00:48.870 --> 00:49.890
So let's get started.

00:49.890 --> 00:58.260
I have a wire here that has a like L and it has a total charge q and its charge is uniformly distributed

00:58.290 --> 01:00.000
over the length.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.200
So let's see how to solve this problem.

01:03.530 --> 01:03.740
Okay.

01:03.770 --> 01:07.750
So let's start by looking at this system a little bit more closely.

01:07.940 --> 01:09.680
We've got our wire here.

01:09.690 --> 01:13.060
Got our distance x to the point p.

01:13.350 --> 01:16.870
And now let's consider a small little bit of charge.

01:17.100 --> 01:23.310
Somewhere on the wire and the magnitude of that charge is d q.

01:23.400 --> 01:30.510
Now this little charge is going to produce an electric field at point p and it's going to be in this

01:30.510 --> 01:31.540
direction.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.300
And the magnitude of that field is going to be DC.

01:35.310 --> 01:43.350
Now you notice since I've picked the position of the point x to be kind of in the center of that wire

01:45.030 --> 01:49.680
every time there's a little charge D Q up on the top there's also going to be a little charge D Q On

01:49.680 --> 01:50.400
the bottom.

01:50.590 --> 01:55.790
And that one's also going to produce an electric field with the same magnitude.

01:55.820 --> 01:59.790
But in this direction it's pointing away from that small charge.

01:59.790 --> 02:01.900
If it's positive.

02:01.900 --> 02:08.040
So one thing you notice if I find this to be the angle theta This is also going to be the angle theta.

02:08.070 --> 02:13.440
What we're going to notice here is that you would re plot those vectors you'll see that those vectors

02:13.440 --> 02:21.010
can be broken down into components and the y components of those vectors are going to cancel out they're

02:21.010 --> 02:22.200
going to be equal and opposite.

02:23.220 --> 02:28.650
So we can conclude right away just from the symmetry of the problem that the total field E Y is going

02:28.650 --> 02:32.360
to be equal to zero by the symmetry of the problem

02:35.410 --> 02:41.650
every time there's a little charge D Q On the positive y axis there's going to be another charge D Q

02:41.650 --> 02:42.810
On the negative y axis.

02:42.820 --> 02:45.460
So their contributions are always going to cancel out.

02:46.660 --> 02:47.960
So that's kind of the first part.

02:50.140 --> 02:57.830
The second part is the total field is going to be simply in the x direction.

02:57.840 --> 03:03.910
Note Since the y components cancel and while there's gonna be two of them right there's a contribution

03:03.910 --> 03:08.650
from the charge at the bottom and there's gonna be a contribution from the charge of the top.

03:09.400 --> 03:20.220
So you can actually write the x component as being the magnitude times cos of theta and we'll we're

03:20.220 --> 03:25.770
gonna do now is we're gonna add all the x contributions from every single charge here along the length

03:25.770 --> 03:27.490
of the wire.

03:27.630 --> 03:35.610
So in order to do that let's find what the magnitude of DC is and let's substitute with the value of

03:35.610 --> 03:40.710
CO State it is and then we're going to add all the contributions of d e.

03:41.580 --> 03:48.960
So we're left with a D E is going to be oh what's this magnitude of the vector.

03:48.960 --> 03:57.740
Well this is simply the magnitude of the field produced by a charge D Q That's simple that's the expression

03:57.740 --> 04:06.350
we know K the magnitude of the charge divided by the distance squared in the distance squared is simply

04:06.350 --> 04:14.430
the distance from the charge D Q to the point where I'm evaluating that star vector r and I can write

04:14.430 --> 04:21.480
that in terms of the distance x and plus the distance from

04:24.690 --> 04:28.390
the origin to that charge let's call that y.

04:29.550 --> 04:33.600
So here's my distance from the charge to the point.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.800
The other thing I need to do now is find what is the angle Coast theta.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.360
While the angle coast data is also defined here.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.880
So you could see Coast theta simply x divided by by R..

04:46.280 --> 04:56.160
So if you simplify things you'll have K D Q X divided by our cube.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.300
All right great.

04:57.660 --> 05:04.560
Next thing we have to do now is well let's get rid of D Q Because we're gonna have to add over all of

05:04.560 --> 05:07.270
our small little charges okay.

05:07.500 --> 05:16.170
And the way you do that is through the charge density remember our charge density for this wire was

05:16.170 --> 05:19.380
simply the total charge divided by the total length

05:22.680 --> 05:33.720
so that also means that I can write the charge density as D Q divided by the small length d y of this

05:33.720 --> 05:36.690
small tiny segment okay.

05:37.760 --> 05:43.340
So this is kind of something you always do when you're dealing with charge distributions as you have

05:43.340 --> 05:48.010
to eliminate that small charge and write it in terms of the charge density.

05:48.050 --> 05:53.330
So for this specific problem this is kind of what we want to do here.

05:53.390 --> 05:53.600
All right.

05:53.600 --> 06:02.780
We can substitute that in our expression for the electric field and we can replace AR with our variable

06:03.180 --> 06:10.160
or the actual distance here from each small charge D Q to the point p and we're left with this expression

06:10.160 --> 06:20.030
over here that D E and it's only the x component here that you're looking at is simply K X the charge

06:20.030 --> 06:28.430
D Q I replace it with Lambda our charge density times the small element of length DIY and divided by

06:28.430 --> 06:35.980
our cube while R is the root of x squared plus Y squared.

06:36.230 --> 06:40.650
Therefore our cube this is gonna be to the three R's.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.010
All right.

06:41.020 --> 06:48.590
At the end you want to evaluate everything you want to find the total field and again it's only in the

06:48.590 --> 06:55.970
x direction so what you have to do is you have to sum or integrate all the contributions of all the

06:55.970 --> 06:59.090
D X values.

06:59.090 --> 07:05.760
So that means we want to integrate the right hand side of our electric field expression here.

07:06.660 --> 07:20.070
So that's K lambda x d y over X squared plus Y square to the three has and we're gonna integrate that

07:20.080 --> 07:21.750
we're integrating over y.

07:22.450 --> 07:31.690
We're integrating Y and Y goes if the total length of the wires L Y will go from minus L over to all

07:31.690 --> 07:33.010
the way to l over to

07:38.850 --> 07:45.790
not to simplify this a little bit further we can take out all the constants if you take out all the

07:45.790 --> 07:51.130
constants you're simply going to get that the total expression for the electric field is the magnitude

07:51.130 --> 07:57.430
of the x component is going to be KS A CONSTANT I could take it out of the integral land as a constant

07:58.570 --> 08:09.490
and left with the integral from minus L over to the L over to of x d y divided by X squared plus Y squared

08:10.310 --> 08:12.570
to the three halves.

08:12.890 --> 08:13.220
All right.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.420
So actually I could have factored out the X right.

08:17.440 --> 08:20.290
The X is also a constant for this problem.

08:20.710 --> 08:22.300
So let's do that right now.

08:23.920 --> 08:29.530
Let me take the X out and let's just put it out here all right.

08:30.090 --> 08:31.930
So let's go see how to evaluate this term

08:34.870 --> 08:35.140
okay.

08:35.140 --> 08:41.670
The next step I did was well we have to evaluate this integral and actually in its current form this

08:41.680 --> 08:45.480
is actually not that easy.

08:45.520 --> 08:53.590
So what I did was I simply went up and looked it up in an integral table kind of sheet a little bit

08:54.080 --> 08:55.300
but that's OK.

08:55.430 --> 09:03.760
I think once you get this result here you can do that to simply look it up in an integral table and

09:03.760 --> 09:10.720
after you're able to write that the total electric field magnitude in the x direction or the x component

09:10.720 --> 09:14.760
the field is simply going to be I'm going to evaluate this.

09:14.760 --> 09:20.350
So everything in the square bracket is what I looked up in the integral table and I'm integrating over

09:20.350 --> 09:20.920
y.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.120
So I'm gonna get y up here.

09:24.220 --> 09:32.680
I'm going to get X squared here and square root of x squared plus Y squared and evaluated between L

09:32.680 --> 09:35.640
over 2 and minus.

09:36.400 --> 09:36.640
All right.

09:36.640 --> 09:45.580
So the next step is you simply substitute in our limits here and this simplifies nicely to a result

09:45.580 --> 09:48.300
that looks like this.

09:48.430 --> 10:00.320
We're gonna have l over 2 divided by X squared X squared plus L over 2 squared and minus again.

10:00.340 --> 10:07.670
Now we're gonna have the same thing minus L over to X squared

10:14.160 --> 10:14.490
okay.

10:14.500 --> 10:20.740
So our final expression for the electric field or the magnitude of the electric field which is in the

10:20.740 --> 10:21.490
x direction

10:24.400 --> 10:28.770
is simply going to be both of those terms that are double up.

10:29.180 --> 10:29.440
Okay.

10:29.500 --> 10:34.920
They add up together and that means that this factor of two in the denominator here is going to leave.

10:35.020 --> 10:43.720
So we're gonna be left with K lambda l There's still an x term over there and this whole term is still

10:43.720 --> 10:52.750
there the square root of x squared plus L over 2 squared 1 simplification you can make you can get rid

10:52.750 --> 10:58.660
of the charge density remember the charge density we can write as the total charge divided by the total

10:58.660 --> 11:00.030
length.

11:00.630 --> 11:05.980
The nice thing about making this substitution is it's going to get the final solution a nice form because

11:05.980 --> 11:08.890
it's going to eliminate this length over here so let's do that.

11:08.890 --> 11:10.650
So we're gonna be left with K.

11:10.960 --> 11:20.560
The total charge that was on the wire divided by x divided by X squared plus L over 2 squared.

11:21.280 --> 11:27.370
So here's the final expression we get for our electric field produced by the wire when I'm a distance

11:27.400 --> 11:30.630
x away from the center of the wire.

11:30.970 --> 11:31.290
All right.

11:31.330 --> 11:37.420
So now let's manipulate this formula a little bit and see what happens when we're really far away from

11:37.420 --> 11:37.840
the wire.

11:37.870 --> 11:40.570
So we're gonna make X very very big and take the right limit.

11:41.150 --> 11:46.230
And what happens when x is small compared to the overall length of the wire.

11:47.140 --> 11:52.210
OK so now let's take the limit when we're gonna be really really far away from the wire.

11:52.280 --> 11:56.920
So actually Ed that didn't probably exaggerate this diagram enough but we're going to take the limit

11:56.920 --> 12:00.090
here when X is much much bigger than L.

12:00.310 --> 12:05.500
So how do we simplify this expression when X is very big.

12:05.500 --> 12:12.790
Well for that you simply have to expand the denominator and the way we're gonna do that is we're going

12:12.790 --> 12:15.250
to leave that x term alone.

12:15.250 --> 12:20.740
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to factor out one of the X terms from that square root rather than writing

12:20.740 --> 12:21.460
a square root.

12:21.460 --> 12:26.440
I'm simply going to write it as something raised to the 1 1/2.

12:26.950 --> 12:34.370
So if I take out an X and I already had an X on the outside I'm gonna have X squared over here.

12:34.810 --> 12:46.300
Now I'll be left with 1 plus L over 2 squared divided by also going to be divided by X squared because

12:46.300 --> 12:50.770
I factored out x an x squared term.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.130
Okay.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.000
Now what do we do.

12:53.350 --> 12:56.590
Well take a look at this term over here.

12:56.590 --> 13:04.900
This term in the denominator if X is very very big compared to l this term in the denominator at least

13:04.900 --> 13:08.610
the second part of it is going to be a very very small term.

13:08.980 --> 13:13.320
So you're gonna have one plus something that is very very small.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.450
And the way you expand that

13:20.130 --> 13:30.080
so if I have one and one plus a variable let's call it alpha where alpha is very very small.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.100
And in this case this is also raised to the one power.

13:33.130 --> 13:40.510
This here is approximately equal to one minus one half Alpha.

13:40.510 --> 13:45.690
Actually for this specific problem let's even just keep the one let's not even worry about this term.

13:45.770 --> 13:46.540
Right.

13:46.570 --> 13:49.720
If X is very big I divide by a very big number.

13:49.720 --> 13:57.790
This term is negligible compared to the one in which you're left with is simply at the field the X is

13:57.790 --> 14:01.880
simply k q divided by X squared.

14:03.940 --> 14:08.130
Well that should look like a really familiar result.

14:08.380 --> 14:15.460
This is exactly the fields you'd get if it was a point charged with a charge q right here at the origin

14:16.060 --> 14:20.000
and you were a distance x away and you were really far away right.

14:20.050 --> 14:21.250
Looks like a point charge

14:27.340 --> 14:33.150
so even though you had a uniform charge distribution here once you're really really far away it basically

14:33.150 --> 14:34.440
just looks like a point.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.780
So I kind of expect that result.

14:36.780 --> 14:41.880
Even before doing any of the calculation so let's have a look.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.250
Now what happens when I'm really close to the wire.

14:45.210 --> 14:51.430
So the distance x relative to the overall length is much much smaller.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.530
So how do you simplify this expression that limit.

14:54.760 --> 15:03.990
Well so in that limit what I can first do is I can first factor out turn from the bottom.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.660
It's similar to the previous case.

15:06.660 --> 15:11.790
So let's keep those terms the same except now instead of factoring out an X I don't want to do that

15:11.790 --> 15:13.700
because X is gonna be small.

15:13.790 --> 15:14.740
Okay.

15:14.880 --> 15:20.220
Actually what I want to do this time is I want to factor out an L over to term.

15:20.220 --> 15:25.970
If I factor out an L over to term well this term here is gonna be 1 plus.

15:26.040 --> 15:35.340
I'm gonna be left with x l over 2 squared and everything to the 1 half might have to just think about

15:35.340 --> 15:37.500
that for a little bit.

15:37.500 --> 15:37.920
All right.

15:38.070 --> 15:44.700
So now we're in the limit of x much much less than L.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.530
So what can I do to this term.

15:46.560 --> 15:53.150
Again if X is much much less than L this second term is very small compared to 1.

15:53.630 --> 15:57.320
So if it's very small compared to 1 Let's just get rid of it.

15:57.480 --> 16:00.700
So that's also the reason why you want to factor out an L over 2.

16:00.700 --> 16:06.690
Now you want to end up getting an expression in this denominator where we have one plus something that

16:06.690 --> 16:09.260
is very very small.

16:09.540 --> 16:09.950
All right.

16:10.050 --> 16:16.620
So at the end once you make this approximation you can write that field in the x direction simply going

16:16.620 --> 16:20.600
to be there's an L over to term I'm going to bring that 2 to the top.

16:20.700 --> 16:21.630
It's Kate Q

16:24.240 --> 16:32.310
divided by X and there's still an L there and I can't forget the total charge q over l like this and

16:32.340 --> 16:36.500
this whole term simply becomes a one the square root of 1 which is 1.

16:37.020 --> 16:44.340
The last thing I can do now is we can simplify this a little bit and fir the long wire it's probably

16:44.340 --> 16:49.980
best to write this in terms of yeah here's our factor of total charge divided by the total length.

16:49.980 --> 16:57.720
That's simply the charge density so you can write this as two times the constant K are charged density

16:58.680 --> 17:07.800
divided by X so the magnitude of the electric field produced by a wire when you're very close to it

17:08.950 --> 17:14.730
is simply this expression over here.

17:14.730 --> 17:19.680
Again if you remember what the constant K is K is simply 1 over for Pi Epsilon 0.

17:20.160 --> 17:30.490
So if you substitute that in there you're going to end up getting over to PI Epsilon 0 times x.

17:30.810 --> 17:35.100
Actually this is the exact same result you get using Gauss as law.

17:35.820 --> 17:36.770
I have a video on that.

17:36.780 --> 17:42.150
You can go have a look at it but if you want to find a field produced by an infinitely long wire or

17:42.150 --> 17:47.550
a really long wire you can use goats is low due to the symmetry of the problem and you'll get the same

17:47.550 --> 17:50.330
result here in the right hand box.
