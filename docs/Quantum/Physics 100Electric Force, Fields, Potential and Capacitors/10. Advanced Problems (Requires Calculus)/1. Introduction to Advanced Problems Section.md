# Introduction to Advanced Problems Section

## 10. Advanced Problems (Requires Calculus)

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Hi guys. Doctor e here on this section is the advanced problems section what I mean by advanced problems and these are problems where you're given a điện tích distribution it could be uniform it could be variation doesn't matter. But what you have to do in order to find the field or the electrical thế somewhere in space is you have to use some calculus because you have to add them all up. Vậy we call this you have to integrate them in order to find the total điện trường. Vậy if you're taking an algebra based physics class I probably wouldn't worry too much about the section I mean feel free to go watch the videos see how it's done but it's usually something that's a little too advanced for algebra based physics classes. If you're an undergrad and wanted to learn how to do these things then yeah by all means watch the videos. I'll add some more problems from time to time if students have requests of advanced problems. I also include them in this section. Được. Thanks for watching.
