# Electrical Potential and Electric Field from a Charged Disk

## 10. Advanced Problems (Requires Calculus)

### Tóm tắt nội dung

Hi everybody physics ninja here today I want to look at the thế the thế v that's created from a điện tích disk. Vậy yeah I have a disk and I've placed the disk in the x y mặt phẳng what I'm going to do that this is I'm going to give it a uniform điện tích distribution. Vậy that's the Sigma over here. And again this is going to be a hằng số điện tích distribution or we want to do Bây giờ is I want to go above this desk a certain khoảng cách Trong trường hợp này it's going to be denoted by the letter Z. What I want to do is I want to tính toán what is the thế V Đúng here at this point. Đúng. And what happens then in the limit. What happens at that point is very very far away from the disk. điều gì xảy ra nếu it's very close to the disk. What else can we tính toán. If I know the thế as a function of that letter Z I can also tính toán what the điện trường is. Vậy what is the field when I'm close to this plate or if I'm very very far away from that plate. Vậy it's kind of a nice problem. It's going to involve some integration because I have a uniform điện tích distribution. Vậy we're going to start by setting that up and then do all the rest of the calculations. Được. Vậy to get started when I'm first going to do is I'm going to xem xét a tiny little patch Đúng here in this little patch here has a điện tích which I'm going to denote as D Q some infinitesimal amount of điện tích. And I want to evaluate its contribution to the electrical thế at this point here point P which is a high Z above this disk is disk allies in the x y mặt phẳng. Let's go ahead and just write this as that khoảng cách over here. Bây giờ chúng ta có to định nghĩa one more thing the khoảng cách Bây giờ from the origin all the way to where this các điện tích. Let's call that our Prime Bây giờ. You should be able to write that the khoảng cách from this little điện tích all the way to that point. This is just using Pythagorean. Nothing too complicated here it's our prime bình phương and plus Z bình phương. Được rồi. Bây giờ we should be able to write an expression Bây giờ for the thế produced by this little bit of điện tích and I call that an infinitesimal thế because it's only the contribution from this little điện tích at the end. You'll have to integrate in order to get the total contribution. Vậy again this is simply D Q divided by four pi Epsilon 0 and the khoảng cách. It's always the khoảng cách away from the điện tích to the point where I'm evaluating the Vậy that khoảng cách is what we just obtain helps get rid of that. This is our prime bình phương. And again plus Z bình phương. Được rồi. Vậy that's it. It looks like that's it. The only thing I have to do Bây giờ is I have to add all the contributions Vậy chúng ta có to do one more step here. What is this little element of điện tích. Well there's a little element of điện tích is going to be my điện tích density multiplied by the area. Vậy let's take this phương trình one step further. This is my charged my điện tích density and multiplied by the area call it D.A. and again the bottom Bây giờ is just stays the exact same for Pi Epsilon 0. And again square root of the rest of this term are prime bình phương plus Z bình phương. Được to get the total thế which is really what I'm after to get the total thế what you have to do Bây giờ is chúng ta có to integrate and we're gonna have to integrate the expressions like this in order to add up all the contributions to get the total thế and that here is only going to be a function of Z for this particular problem. Được. Vậy let's evaluate this integral we're doing we're working in cylindrical coordinate systems Vậy the thế as a function of V. Let's take out all the hằng số term Vậy you should have a điện tích density which pops out the other terms that pop out are gonna be this for Pi the Epsilon 0. Bây giờ I could write out the integral. Bây giờ there's two integrals because I'm integrating over the total area of this disk and in cylindrical coordinates the integral goes from 0 to 2 pi. That's for the angle theta. And I also want to integrate over the total radius Vậy that I'll go from zero all the way to uppercase R. That's the radius of this disk and that's it. Bây giờ here I'm going to replace this little element of area again the little element of area for the cylindrical coordinates can always be written as our prime D.R. prime. And again I've already got the D theta here. Vậy maybe let me just explicitly write this down here that the area can also be written as D.R. times are prime and multiplied by D theta. Được. That's where this whole substitution over here came in Vậy don't worry about that. And again at the end we're still left with this term here in the denominator in the denominator. I still have this square root term which is our prime bình phương and plus Z bình phương. Được Vậy this looks like a nasty expression. The first term however this is pretty straightforward since there is Không other dependents on the angle theta over here. The integral from 0 to 2 pi of D theta simply gives me 2 pi. Vậy let's go ahead and simplify this even more Vậy we get our charged distribution sigma. We get the 4 pi Epsilon 0 this first integral let's just write is this this is going to be 2 pi. And Bây giờ the final integral will go in the next page in just a second here. But this is really at the heart of the problem. The square root of our prime bình phương plus Z bình phương. Notice you can cancel out 2 pi and cancel out your left with a 2 here at the bottom. Được Vậy Bây giờ let's go on the next page and I'll show you how to evaluate this second term over here. The second integral over the total radius to get our final expression for the thế Được rồi. Vậy to evaluate the second term here what you have to do is you can either look it up in an integral table. This one is actually pretty straightforward. We could do just this substitution. I'm going to do a substitution or I'm going to định nghĩa you as our prime bình phương plus Z bình phương. Bây giờ if I make that substitution điều đó có nghĩa là that the limits Bây giờ of the integral have to change Đúng instead of going from 0 to are the limits the new limits here are going to be while the lower limit is you substitute the zero for the R prime Vậy you have Z bình phương and the upper limit is you're going to have uppercase r bình phương plus Z bình phương. Vậy those are our new limits of integration. Bây giờ the other thing I have to do Bây giờ is I have to differentiate this. điều đó có nghĩa là that do you mind if I differentiate that with respect to r what you end up getting here the second term is is just acts as a hằng số because I'm not differentiating with respect to the letter Z. What you're left with here is simply to our prime. Bây giờ that doesn't quite look like the top term Vậy chúng ta có to just rearrange it a little bit if you rearrange a little bit what you're going to find here is that if I have our prime D.R. prime. That should be equal to D you over too. OK Vậy Bây giờ we go ahead and we make the substitution and this is what you should end up with that my thế. At least the integral can be written as the first terms don't change. These are only hằng số terms. Bây giờ I'm changing I've made a change of variable over here Vậy what I'm changing Bây giờ is I'm going to integrate all the way from Z bình phương all the way to our bình phương plus Z bình phương. Được. Bây giờ we make these substitution for all of these terms over here. Vậy the are prime D.R. prime Well that gets substituted by this guy Đúng here. Vậy that simply becomes do you divide it by two. Được rồi. Bây giờ here I'm still dividing by the square root of this term. And Bây giờ one term is pretty easy. Vậy I'm gonna have the square root of you. OK. Bây giờ this is getting pretty straightforward Bây giờ actually this integral Đúng here is one that's pretty straightforward. Vậy let's go on the other page and evaluate this and get to our final expression for the thế. OK. Vậy this is pretty straightforward at this point all chúng ta có to do is maybe pull out the to bring that to the front and then we're left with a very very simple in a row. But let me just do one intermediate step for you over for Epsilon 0. Again this are still going to be the same limits I'm not going to rewrite them over here. And what you're left with here is d you divided by square root of you. And that term is pretty straightforward Được rồi. I always like to write it off for me my personal preference here is just the Đúng it is you to the minus one half Đúng. That's exactly what this term is. And the integral Bây giờ with respect to do you. Được rồi. Vậy this you should be able to just write this down. Đúng. This is kind of a standard function Vậy we get over for Epsilon 0. Được rồi. Bây giờ this guy here is again you add 1. Vậy we're going to have you to the. If you add one to negative 1 1/2 you're left with one 1/2 and you also have to divide by that term by the same term. Vậy we get this and again this is evaluated Bây giờ between the limits of Z bình phương and r bình phương plus Z bình phương. Vậy all chúng ta có to do Bây giờ is simply substitute those limits into this expression and we'll have our final expression for the thế one thing I could simplify over here this too can cancel out. I could take two out of there and I'm left with this. Được rồi. One last step. We get to our final expression. Let's do it Vậy I'm left with. Bây giờ just substituting those limits Sigma over to Epsilon 0 remains the same. Bây giờ again if you substitute our bình phương Plaza bình phương into here and write it in kind of a slightly different form over here let's write that one half as a square root. And here I am left with our bình phương plus Z bình phương. Vậy it depends on how far away you are. Được rồi. That makes sense and also on the dimensions of the disk that almost also makes sense. And don't forget to substitute this lower limit here because we did a change of variable over here. OK. Vậy chúng ta có something like this. The other thing you can do Bây giờ is I mean you could simplify this a little bit if I wanted to factor out a Z. I could do that. Vậy let's go ahead here and that would look like Sigma over to Epsilon 0. Bây giờ if you take out a z over here again imagine the Z is above the desk or if it's below the disk you're going to get the same thế. Đúng. It's going to be some positive value of the thế and you could see that this is always going to be a positive value Đúng. There is nothing in this term here again assuming that the điện tích density is positive. But this first term is always going to be bigger than the second term. Được rồi if I factor out a Z I'm going to just going to write that as absolute value of Z. What you're left with Bây giờ in the bracket is again if you factor out Z bình phương from the square root you'll end up have an absolute value of z over here. Vậy the first term will look like this just change the order a little bit. This will be R over Z bình phương make sure you can kind of understand that step. And again this is gonna be minus one. You're going to see why in a minute that I kind of like this form over here. Được rồi. Vậy this is the value or a function of the thế as a function of the value z. I want to examine this this phương trình here on the next page and we're going to take some limits here. Like điều gì xảy ra nếu I'm really really far away from the desk and how can I use this expression ví dụ to tính toán the điện trường. But we've done all the work. This is really the final expression. Let's go on the next page just to make sure this expression makes sense physically Được rồi. Vậy here's our expression that we've gotten this is a general expression here I haven't made any simplifications to this expression. This is just what the math gave us what the calculus gave us. Vậy it looks like a rather complicated expression however Bây giờ I want to exploit limit. It's always a good idea to explore limits when you get to algebraic expressions like this. Vậy the first one is what happens Bây giờ if I'm really really far away Đúng. And điều đó có nghĩa là điều gì xảy ra nếu Z is much much bigger than the radius. Think about it. Vậy you have a disk in front of you and you go to a khoảng cách that's really really far away. First of all the thế should be small. And we're going to find that however how does the thế vary. If you're really really far away from a disk Well if you're really really far away from something that looks like this it probably looks like a point. Vậy our result here which doesn't look like a point điện tích it should reduce to that of the point điện tích when I'm far away from it. Vậy let's go ahead and make this make this verification. Vậy when you're far away what I'm gonna do here is first look at this time. Được rồi. If Z is bigger than R điều đó có nghĩa là that this term over here that's going to end up getting bình phương is going to be a small term. Vậy let's first look at what that term looks like in this limit. This term over here which is square root of 1 plus are over overseas bình phương. Let's get rid of this don't need that that there is approximately going to be equal to. Let me write it out as one extra step first. Some people may not know this Đúng. This is just using kind of a binomial expansion. Let me just write as one plus R over Z again this term here is bình phương. And this is really to the 1 1/2 Đúng in the limit of Z much bigger than R. This here becomes approximately equal to one plus one half are overseas bình phương. Bây giờ there's higher order terms but we're just going to keep those terms. Bây giờ if you completely neglected this term if you say that disease is really really big well then you might just completely get rid of this one and then you would have one under the square root minus one and that would give you zero. Well that really doesn't give you any functional dependence over here Vậy we're gonna keep these first two terms for this expansion. Được rồi let's have a look Bây giờ of what we end up getting. Vậy we get Sigma over to Epsilon 0 absolute value of Z and Bây giờ this whole term you Bây giờ the one is going to cancel with this one here again chúng ta có thể write out the whole square bracket but chúng ta có one plus one half. This is our bình phương over Z bình phương and minus one close the bracket. Được rồi. This will cancel with this. Bây giờ what you're left with over here is again this too I can bring it out to the front. Let's write down all the terms over here. Vậy chúng ta có our điện tích density the điện tích density here you can really write as the total điện tích. That total điện tích of the disk is going to be some value Q and divided by the total radius and total radius saw the total area of the disk which is simply power bình phương. Được. Vậy if you go ahead and do this let's get rid of the điện tích density here and write it out as Q and divided by higher bình phương. Bây giờ this too is going to combine this one Đúng here. That's going to combine to a four. Được rồi what else do chúng ta có the other terms here as I have a z up here and I have Z bình phương over here. Vậy this guy here can cancel with one of those. You'll notice that the absolute values are also taking care of here in the last part here is I simply have an R bình phương that's left over Đúng here. Vậy that term has to stay and I'm also going to have just one Z here in the denominator. Notice the R squares cancel. Bây giờ if you're a little bit careful we group all the terms together what you're left with is the total điện tích of that disk divided by four pi and there is a Z here in the denominator and that there's the thế and that just looks exactly like the thế produced by a point điện tích that has a value Q and if I'm a certain khoảng cách Z away from it. Vậy this here totally checks out Đúng that one there makes sense physically. Vậy when you're really really far away this whole disk just acts like a point điện tích and Bây giờ you can also tính toán the điện trường and you'll get to the standard expression. Được rồi in the second case what I want to do Bây giờ is what happens Bây giờ if I'm really close I'm really close to the desk again. If I look at my general expression that's OK and this limit here Z is going to be much smaller than R. I don't want to said Z equal to zero I'm just going to be above it by some small value. Vậy that looks like well Trong trường hợp này here if I look at the term in the square root if Z is small điều đó có nghĩa là that the second term here is going to be pretty big and it's going to be much bigger than the one. Vậy in that case here I could just neglect the one term over here and what you're left with is that my thế is going to look like this Sesay OK. Bây giờ you can cancel out the one here forget about that term this second term is much bigger and it's bình phương and if that's under the square root again what we're gonna be left with here is are over ze and again minus one again that's what the square root term simplifies to and the limit that Z is much smaller than R. Bây giờ if you carry out this multiplication over here what you're left with is this term. Again I'll just multiply through by this absolute value of Z and what you're left with here is ah again minus Z she does this makes sense to you. Vậy you have to ask yourself Đúng. This first term here what is this first term represent. It's simply a hằng số term. That's actually the thế of the disk. Được rồi. If I'm Đúng on the desk and then what does this tell you. The second term over here tells me that it varies linearly with khoảng cách from the disk. Đúng. This is a linear term. And does that makes sense. Well think about it what if Bây giờ if you wanted to evaluate what was the điện trường. How would I evaluate the điện trường if I'm really close to the disk. Đúng the điện trường you should be the Đúng as the derivative of the thế with respect to my variable here. Bây giờ with respect to D.C.. Được rồi. If you take the derivative and let's just assume that here we're above this desk Vậy you don't have to really worry about the absolute value and what you end up getting here Trong trường hợp này would be that the điện trường the first term if you differentiate it with respect to Z you get zero. This negative sign will cancel with this one Đúng here. Vậy that off the worry about those and if you take the derivative of Z with respect to Z you're simply going to get one in the value of the electric feel that you get is going to be Sigma divided by two Epsilon zero Đúng. This is the điện trường just above the mặt of the disk. And that's exactly what you would get if you would use something called Gauss law goes as law is often used to tính toán fields close to objects and you get the same result. Vậy if we're gonna sketch Bây giờ what this thế looks like again these are the results for the two limits. Far away chúng ta có a thế basically due to a point điện tích and Q Was the total điện tích of the disk when you're kind of close to the desk if you're really close to something it basically just looks like an infinite flat mặt. It's not really infinite Trong trường hợp này it does have a finite size. Vậy what you have here is a thế that drops linearly with khoảng cách away from the disk. Được. And that also reduces to an điện trường that's more or less hằng số. Đúng. It's very little dependence on the khoảng cách if you're close to it for the điện trường. Bây giờ if we we're going to make a sketch of what V looks like as a function of khoảng cách it would look something like this. Vậy in this first section it would be linear. And the term here has a negative slope. Vậy it goes down and then eventually it starts kind of dropping dropping dropping. And when you're far away again it looks like one over Z one over Z down in this area Đúng here when you're far away from it. And when you're close to adhere it's linear and the dependence is basically minus Đúng some negative slope because it's dropping and the value Đúng over here again. I second tính toán that is simply this first term over here when Z equals zero. Vậy the value Đúng here is some hằng số value. This is basically what V.S. is. Được rồi. Vậy that's what the thế looks like for a finite sized disk as a function of khoảng cách from that disk. And again here I'm just doing the calculation when I'm on the axis which is the easiest case.
