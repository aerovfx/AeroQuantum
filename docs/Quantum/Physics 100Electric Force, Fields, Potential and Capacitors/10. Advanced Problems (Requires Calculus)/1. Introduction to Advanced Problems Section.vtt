Hi guys.

00:01.570 --> 00:07.050
Doctor e here on this section is the advanced problems section what I mean by advanced problems and

00:07.050 --> 00:13.530
these are problems where you're given a charge distribution it could be uniform it could be variation

00:13.530 --> 00:14.790
doesn't matter.

00:14.790 --> 00:19.470
But what you have to do in order to find the field or the electrical potential somewhere in space is

00:19.470 --> 00:22.900
you have to use some calculus because you have to add them all up.

00:22.980 --> 00:27.480
So we call this you have to integrate them in order to find the total electric field.

00:27.480 --> 00:32.370
So if you're taking an algebra based physics class I probably wouldn't worry too much about the section

00:32.400 --> 00:36.420
I mean feel free to go watch the videos see how it's done but it's usually something that's a little

00:36.570 --> 00:39.570
too advanced for algebra based physics classes.

00:39.570 --> 00:44.640
If you're an undergrad and wanted to learn how to do these things then yeah by all means watch the videos.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.490
I'll add some more problems from time to time if students have requests of advanced problems.

00:49.490 --> 00:51.350
I also include them in this section.

00:51.380 --> 00:51.870
Okay.

00:51.990 --> 00:53.380
Thanks for watching.
