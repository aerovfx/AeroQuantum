1
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,760
All right, so for this part of the problem, what we're trying to figure out is we're trying to determine

2
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,350
how long it takes for Philip to paddle across the river.

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,880
Now where which we solve this is we harken back to elementary physics.

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:40,100
And we know that physics tells us that the velocity of any any kind of unit, any kind of object moving

5
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,730
at speed.

6
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:49,990
Is no different than the change in the lane or the change in the time, now this is at an infinitesimal

7
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,500
point.

8
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,300
We're assuming that the velocity is constant so we can use something like this without going into calculus

9
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,200
or.

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,750
Considering, Ephraim, infinitesimally small units.

11
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,740
But.

12
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:16,000
For this problem, what we know is that we want to figure we know the distance 30 is 40 across this

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,420
river.

14
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,040
I will write it now.

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,960
So we got the distance, the length.

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,820
It must travel.

17
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,230
40 meters.

18
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,210
We have this guy.

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:38,120
We know the velocity with respect to the ground, and we have to use the ground because this distance

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,120
is in the ground reference frame, right?

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,430
Distance from Philip to this guy is going to change, this is constant in the ground frame.

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,440
So if we use this in the ground frame.

23
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:58,800
That, combined with the distance D will allow us to solve for Delta T.

24
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,180
OK, so what we want to do.

25
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:10,200
Is we want to use the Y component because velocity in the X direction does not contribute to diminishing

26
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,020
this devalue in Y right.

27
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,510
It just moves it to the left closer to B, and that's partially why this guy ends up.

28
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:26,120
At the in the horizontal direction, but in the y direction, every second we're going to go four meters.

29
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,190
And that's what we want to use here.

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,300
OK, so if we take our conventions of labeling everything to make sense of what's going on, this just

31
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,900
becomes.

32
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,680
The velocity of the boat or fill up with respect to the ground.

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,010
It's going to be equal to the the entire distance de.

34
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,180
So I'm going to put a wide down there.

35
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,930
Over Delta T.

36
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,040
OK.

37
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,170
And I'm using this.

38
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,870
We can isolate deputy and figure out how long it takes.

39
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:04,560
All right.

40
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,820
That's the name of the game here.

41
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,200
So Delta State.

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,570
Becomes.

43
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,650
DIY.

44
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,660
Over VP.

45
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,220
With respect to G8 in the wider action.

46
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,940
OK, so I'm going to go back to that, why there?

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,180
Because we're only considering the y component of velocity.

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,230
And if we plug this straight in, we're going to get the result that we're looking for.

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,010
So, you know, DUI is 40 meters distance, it travels.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,510
And we already calculated the velocity in the wider action.

51
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,560
Right up here, the J component is four meters per second.

52
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,080
We see two meters cancel off.

53
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,980
And the second one pops up to the top.

54
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,510
So.

55
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,340
We get a value of 10 seconds.

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,950
So after 10 seconds, he starts paddling.

57
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,100
He quickly gets to the other coast at point B and crosses the river.

58
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,980
OK, so that's pretty straightforward, right?

59
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,530
And since I'm all for intuition, let's jump to the next part of the problem.

60
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,670
All right.

61
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,530
Now that we know the time it takes for Phil to paddle all the way across the river.

62
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,620
Next, we want to figure out in this part of the problem is what is the total distance between points

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,940
A and B?

64
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:41,390
We know the Y component is 40 meters, but what about the X component when which we solve this is again,

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,210
we're going to operate in the ground of reference frame.

66
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,760
We've already calculate are velocity.

67
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:55,400
But if we know that fill up, it takes 10 seconds to get across this river or to traverse the distance

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,060
in the Y.

69
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,320
Then after that time, that's going to give us the distance that was traveled in the X direction.

70
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,300
So again, what we're going to use is elementary physics concepts.

71
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:15,730
And we're going to see that the velocity of fill up with respect back to the ground and the extraction

72
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:24,670
for a constant velocity that's going to be the distance traveled in the X direction over the entire

73
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,810
time of the trip.

74
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,520
And we already have that time.

75
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,680
It's not going to change between the two.

76
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,650
These two sections, these two calculations.

77
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,290
Now we want to find is Delta X.

78
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:42,400
We want to find how far it has traversed the extraction due to this velocity last year.

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,110
The water is back to the ground, right, because as he paddles across, he's trying to go straight,

80
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,670
according to himself.

81
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,300
But he is going to drift to the left due to this philosophy, so all you need to do is isolate Delta

82
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,330
X, so Delta X becomes.

83
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:09,770
The fill up with his back to the ground, the X component times Delta T and now we just plug in shock,

84
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,160
right?

85
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,770
Simple, straightforward problem, right?

86
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,110
So what we want is the X component.

87
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,210
So he's going to traverse.

88
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,600
Negative six meters per second.

89
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,800
And in 10 seconds.

90
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,460
That's going to tell us that.

91
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,040
If we cancel these units, the second is cancel.

92
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,170
We end up with meters.

93
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,800
We had negative 60 meters.

94
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,720
And it's going to be in the X direction will superfluous, but I'm going to include that.

95
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:53,660
OK, so now we know that in 10 seconds, Philip travels 40 meters in the right direction and 60 meters

96
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:00,410
in the X direction, and now we want to figure out the distance from point A to B. We need the theory

97
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,160
in their own right.

98
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,720
So if we take.

99
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,740
Point A and Point B.

100
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,860
And form a nice triangle that looks terrible.

101
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,980
But we just need a vague representation, what we're doing here.

102
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,510
So in the y direction.

103
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,580
We have a 40.

104
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,550
Meter value.

105
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,510
And in the X direction, we have a 60 years value.

106
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,760
And what we're trying to find is the Typekit hypotenuse stake.

107
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,330
All right, well, we can just take the green theorem.

108
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,500
That's pretty straightforward, right?

109
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:49,800
So we know that oh h squared is equal to 60 metres squared plus 40 metres squared.

110
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,760
And if you like working with variables.

111
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,550
Is it basically Delta X, Delta Y?

112
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,780
And all we need to do is literally take the square root.

113
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,100
And that will give us the answer we're looking for.

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,260
The distance, the total distance he traveled.

115
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:20,450
So when we do this on the sky calculator, right, you get 30, 600 plus what 600 and then you square

116
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,140
that puppy.

117
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,170
What you end up with is a result of each each.

118
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,760
Approximately equal to seventy two meters.

119
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:32,560
Right?

120
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,450
Literally just plug and shut.

121
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,630
So, you know, that sort of makes sense.

122
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,510
This is going to be longer than its legs.

123
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,570
Joe Walther intuition.

124
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,890
And now to wrap up the problem or consider one last section, one last part, which is pretty important.

125
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,060
All right.

126
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,560
So we're almost finished the problem.

127
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,040
The last part we want to question and we're going to wrap this up is Part E, which states that or questions.

128
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,290
Rather, how long does Terrence think it takes for fill up to cross the river?

129
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,540
Now, when you read this kind of question, you're probably like, OK, let's do the same exact thing

130
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,140
we've been doing.

131
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,880
Let's start labeling the losses, figure out what reference frame we want to do and who your mind is

132
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,310
probably firing a mile a minute.

133
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,460
And what I want to is stop and say stop.

134
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,690
In order to solve this problem, we already have the answer, right?

135
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,740
What's the answer?

136
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,280
We'll see.

137
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,420
Do we have to do anything?

138
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,350
No, we do not have to do anything.

139
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,730
Why?

140
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:40,350
Because as we showed in driving all these formulas right, we had an inherent assumption and that assumption

141
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,270
was grounded in our understanding of every situation in front of us, right?

142
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,390
I like to say that kids are sometimes the best physicists because you when you're a toddler, you're

143
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,520
trying to make sense of the world in front of you, right?

144
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,770
You play off blocks, you drop them, you see how they fall, you analyze what's going on and using

145
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,520
that information.

146
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,310
You form your own understanding of the universe, right?

147
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:10,650
So when a kid would say is that, oh, if I had a clock and I did something and you had a clock or our

148
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,250
clocks would sync up right, there would be no difference.

149
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:20,370
In other words, what we assumed in putting this together is that time is absolute right.

150
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:29,460
What we said is that Delta T in the ref's frame is equal to Delta T and the moving frame.

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,180
Right?

152
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,160
So in any kind of reference frame that we deal with these problems, what we're going to know is we're

153
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,600
going to say they're equivalent.

154
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,150
So using this problem, the Delta T.

155
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,520
Of parents observing the moving reference frame, they're both sort of moving, but of course, a parent's

156
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,150
right.

157
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,830
He's going to be still.

158
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,370
To Delta and Terrence is going to be equal to Delta.

159
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,950
Delta T in Phillips reference frame.

160
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,870
And there is no difference.

161
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:05,500
This is sort of a trick question to sort of make you think about this problem and we sort of take this

162
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,250
for granted, right?

163
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,250
I'm sure you would agree that time is absolute.

164
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,340
That's not going to change between different conceptions of it.

165
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,650
But as we start jumping into special relativity, the wacky world of special relativity, what we're

166
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:23,440
going to find is that assumptions and assertions that perhaps we established as a child or that we take

167
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,980
for granted have to be questioned to sort of get to the result that actually happens in the real world,

168
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,220
right?

169
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,620
We would like to hold our intuition.

170
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:41,440
We would like to hold these concepts that we take for granted on a silver platter and not really change

171
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,460
them or throw them away.

172
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,890
But sometimes we're going to have to do that.

173
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,790
And that's part of what makes special relativity such a hard subject to wrap our minds around.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,990
And even for scientists back in the day which Einstein proposed, this idea is really to accept them

175
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:07,900
because they really span the face of all the ideas and concepts we've taken for granted that we assume

176
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,910
are universal and absolute.

177
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,950
But if we want to put together that nice universal conception of the universe, we're going to have

178
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,080
to challenge everyday concessions.

179
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,390
We have the universe in order to get to the truth, to the facts.

180
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,070
Okay, so that's the problem we ran through today.

181
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,240
I hope you enjoyed it.

182
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,390
I hope what?

183
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,640
What I want you to get out of this problem is.

184
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,810
And what I want you to continue to do as you run through problems and special relativity is.

185
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,840
Be cognizant of how you keep track of things, keep track of your reference frames and come up with

186
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,170
some kind of system that allows you to keep track of it.

187
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,360
You can use my system here, but in addition to the problems you run through, some homework you have

188
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,780
is when you run through these problems, and I think it's important to do this.

189
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:00,690
You got to figure out some kind of system that helps you keep track of what's going on.

190
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:07,800
Keep track of the different losses and figure out how you can attribute attribute them to different

191
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,700
reference frames, right?

192
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,590
If you can keep track of this stuff.

193
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,260
And it doesn't consume a lot of brainpower that's going to help you stay in tune with what's going on

194
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:23,670
and help you really pierce through those wacky ideas and special relativity so you can build a nice

195
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,520
intuition and really focus on what's going on in the problem in all kinds of physics.

196
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,370
It's really when you run through problems, a big part of it is really keeping track of what's going

197
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:35,600
on.

198
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,930
The accounting portion of it and then plugging in your numbers, right?

199
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,160
This is not the physics, but it's math and accounting.

200
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,620
If you can master this, I promise you, I promise you.

201
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,530
You can focus on the weird ideas, the physical concepts, and then you can master physics problems,

202
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:52,770
right?

203
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,970
This is important.

204
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:58,680
Focus on that when you run through these problems and then I'll join you in the next section.

205
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:05,010
As we delve into our first video talking about special relativity and start taking a look at the wacky

206
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,900
effects that are going to crop up.

207
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,160
Stay tuned.
