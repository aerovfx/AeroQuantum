### Đoạn 1

00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,680 All right. 1 Over the past few months, I've been looking at the physics of radar systems in some general background 2 information on that, and one topic I came across was how to calculate the Doppler shift frequency of 3 a target that's approaching a radar system at a very fast speed. 4

### Đoạn 2

Now when you do this radar systems, you know, they emit beams hoping to hit a target. 5 And then those beams come back when you're trying to calculate that frequency. 6 What frequency you would expect based upon the velocity of that object? 7 What you find is that if you fail to include a relativistic effects, if you do not account for Einstein's 8

### Đoạn 3

theory of special relativity, what you calculate will be incorrect. 9 It will not conform to what you actually observe in nature. 10 So given that fact, I started reviewing special relativity. 11 Looking into that again, derivations and stuff, I found a very interesting. 12

### Đoạn 4

So I thought, why not teach you guys about special relativity? 13 You'll be fine. 14 And you know, this is a very cool topic, one of the coolest topics in physics. 15 OK? 16

### Đoạn 5

A lot of Einstein stuff is OK. 17 So what I intend to do in this video is I want to provide some background information, some history, 18 some background theory and some ideas related to relativity to help you better understand the general 19 climate that scientists were encroached in back in the day when Einstein made his breakthrough discovery 20

### Đoạn 6

in a paper he published in Nineteen Oh five. 21 I want you to understand the dilemma everybody faced what they are trying to solve and why. 22 Einstein's pretty straightforward idea, you know, he developed all this stuff. 23 So a very simple thought experiment. 24

### Đoạn 7

Why this was such a huge, huge breakthrough in physics, one that segment it physics in half between 25 classical physics and modern physics, in a sense. 26 OK, so first and foremost, we're talking about relativity. 27 What exactly is relativity? 28

### Đoạn 8

Well, as with most SECTS in physics, most topics in physics, the name conveys the meaning, right? 29 The terminology conveys the physical phenomena. 30 So this is no different relativity. 31 If you look at it and break down the word, the main root word here is relative. 32

### Đoạn 9

Relativity is the study of how our perceptions of physical phenomenon, how our conception of the universe 33 and how things transpire in front of us, how that is contingent upon the reference frame from which 34 we conceive it again. 35 Our perceptions are contingent upon our perspective, our reference frame. 36

### Đoạn 10

In essence, if somebody perceives something in a certain way based upon their reference frame and somebody 37 else perceive it in a different from a different perspective, the outcomes, the analysis, how they 38 interpret that it may not gel up together. 39 So what relativity is trying to do, it's trying to bridge the gap between perceptions from different 40

### Đoạn 11

perspectives such that we can get some universal absolute conception of the universe. 41 Now this can crop up in physics or metaphysical ideas, right in metaphysics, philosophy, opinions, 42 even politics, for example, somebody's perception, somebody's interpretation of things. 43 It's based upon their perspective. 44

### Đoạn 12

It's based upon how they saw things, is based upon what information they had available. 45 But in terms of physics, relativity has to do with measurements. 46 OK. 47 The way in which you measure length time, velocity, momentum, so on and so forth. 48

### Đoạn 13

But in particular, space and time. 49 What you find is that. 50 Your conception of your conception of how physical laws are played out in front of your eyes. 51 It's contingent upon your perspective is dependent upon your reference frame. 52

### Đoạn 14

OK, and this is a very cool idea because what physics is trying to do is we want to divulge the essence 53 of the universe. 54 All the physical principles that govern motion govern how things are supposed to be right. 55 Any good physical theory is one that should encompass every event that could happen in the universe. 56

### Đoạn 15

Every perspective that could observe that kind of phenomenon, it should be absolute. 57 It should be universal. 58 So any kind of theory of relativity is trying to do that. 59 It's trying to find its absolute universal conception of reality that bridges differences between perspectives. 60

### Đoạn 16

OK. 61 And what I'm going to say is that relativity, the conception of it, is very, very old. 62 So it did not come about for the first time in history when I signed developed his theory of special 63 relativity. 64

### Đoạn 17

When it came about was back in the day when Newton was developing his theories. 65 This is a very classical idea, the very classical idea. 66 So what new was trying to do? 67 He wanted all of his laws to be universal across these reference frames. 68

### Đoạn 18

OK. 69 And when we observe different phenomena throughout the day and, you know, general terms, things that 70 are moving at a slow speed, key work, keep that in mind. 71 The back of your head. 72

### Đoạn 19

Slow speed. 73 We find that different perspectives. 74 You know, they can converge based upon transformations. 75 So what Newton showed first, what he said is that. 76

### Đoạn 20

There is something known as a Galilean invariance. 77 This is part of Newtonian mechanics. 78 What this basically asserts is that physical laws are universal. 79 They're absolute regardless of how you perceive something, regardless of your reference frame, regardless 80

### Đoạn 21

of your perspective, the same physical phenomenon will arise. 81 Things will behave as they are governed by physical laws. 82 Right. 83 Nature is not going to play a fast one on us. 84

### Đoạn 22

It's not going to try to trick us. 85 So we get into the quantum world. 86 That's what makes it super interesting. 87 But in a Newtonian world, Newton's laws are going to rise just as they are so Galilean and variance. 88

### Đoạn 23

A formal definition states that if Newton's laws are valid in one reference rate for one person for 89 one perspective, then they are also valid in an in inertial reference frame. 90 Key word inertial moving at a constant velocity of relative first system. 91 So. 92

### Đoạn 24

There are special relativity is only for inertial reference frames that are moving at a constant velocity. 93 So as you probably learn a physics one to one in inertial reference frames, which the walls are, they 94 are the dominant governing force at play. 95 They always apply. 96

### Đoạn 25

That's why sort of inertial Newton's laws give rise to inertial concepts, and any other reference frame 97 has to have a constant velocity relative to the first system. 98 So to illustrate the initial problem that was faced with Newtonian relativity, which people thought 99 was no big deal, right? 100

### Đoạn 26

They said, Oh, there's this dilemma, they solved it very quickly, which I'll show you in a little 101 bit. 102 They said, this is not interesting. 103 We're not going to look at this ever again until Einstein came around. 104

### Đoạn 27

And a dilemma was presented that he was trying to solve, which I will get to in a second. 105 But let's do a thought experiment. 106 Let's do a thought experiment. 107 Let's see if we had multiple perspectives. 108

### Đoạn 28

If the laws are valid. 109 A space and time can relate it in a universal absolute sense. 110 OK. 111 That's the name of the game. 112

### Đoạn 29

So to do this, what we're going to do is we're going to say we've got two people who are going to conduct 113 this experiment. 114 A guy named Terrence and a guy named Philip Notability MP Al Tarrant's is going to be in a car and he's 115 going to drive at a constant velocity and throw an object and measure. 116

### Đoạn 30

Philip is also going to measure it standing on the ground. 117 So. 118 Philip and Terence, what they do, they say my reference frames are designated as follows Philip's 119 reference frame, his perspective on the physical phenomenon transpiring all around him is going to 120

### Đoạn 31

be a reference frame. 121 S and Terence is going to be a reference frame. 122 S Prime Atari's is only going to move in the X direction. 123 Not going to move in the wide direction or the Z direction coming out of the board. 124

### Đoạn 32

But the S reference frame is going to have an X and Y system at the origin and before the experiment 125 is conducted. 126 What Terence is going to do is say, Hey, I have a clock. 127 Philip has a clock. 128

### Đoạn 33

We're going to synchronize that clock. 129 This references system is primed for Terrence was designated by 02 y prime. 130 So it's going to be fixed through this car, but initially it's going to line up with the origin up. 131 So Terrence is origin, which is going to move the car. 132

### Đoạn 34

I'll call Oprah Prime. 133 His origin is going to be as follows. 134 So first, Tenet. 135 Of relativity back in the day, Newtonian relativity, if you will, you could probably agree that. 136

### Đoạn 35

The time for fill up is going to be the same time as parents, provided that they sync up, right? 137 For example, if we both have a clock which is calibrated properly, the good tool, good instrument, 138 we set it together. 139 I stay at home and I tell you, hey, take your watch. 140

### Đoạn 36

Go to the supermarket. 141 Keep track of your time. 142 Pick up some chicken. 143 We'll make some Chinese food when you come back, something like that when he comes back. 144

### Đoạn 37

You and I would agree. 145 We would agree. 146 Time would be the same our watches would match provided that the tool was precise. 147 That's not surprising. 148

### Đoạn 38

That's a given fact of life that we observe every day. 149 So that's not surprising. 150 So Terence and Phillip, they're going to do that. 151 They're going to synchronize their watch at time. 152

### Đoạn 39

T equals zero. 153 And right when they want to start the experiment, parents. 154 He's going to hit a pedal that makes him automatically go the speed of V v relative, in this case, 155 we're going to go 60 meters per second. 156

### Đoạn 40

And they're going to start their time launches at the same exact time, so their time will be universal. 157 So the transformation that's going to relate time a team breakfast frame as prime in this. 158 Time tea for fill up. 159 It's going to be the same as Prime. 160

### Đoạn 41

Returns not surprising now. 161 Terrence, you guys are speeding off. 162 Then he's going to throw a baseball right here. 163 And he's going to measure it, so Terrence throws it. 164

### Đoạn 42

Throws the ball, shoe flies out, Terrance says. 165 Look at that smirk, baby. 166 I'm going to measure that baseball. 167 It's 10 meters per second, it's 10 meters per second, so he gets a call to his buddy. 168

### Đoạn 43

Hey bro. 169 Yo, Philip. 170 I measured the speed, it's 10 meters per second. 171 What did you measure, would you measure? 172

### Đoạn 44

Well, Philip says, Oh, oh, my God, what are you talking about then? 173 You're lying to me, bro. 174 You're lying to me. 175 I see so many meters per second. 176

### Đoạn 45

What's going on here? 177 Has the universe? 178 Played a trick on Terrence and Philip. 179 Well, you're probably thinking this is sort of silly. 180

### Đoạn 46

And right now it is silly because. 181 We know that. 182 And I'm going to show you very shortly that, you know, we just take the velocity of this and add the 183 velocity of that 60 plus 10 gives us 70. 184

### Đoạn 47

And we're used to that because we're used to everyday events transpiring in front of us. 185 I say kids are like the best physicists because they observe everything there of how things are going 186 to operate and then form their own theories related to it. 187 They would have. 188

### Đoạn 48

Form some kind of theatre related, but since they disagree, what they say is, oh, well, let's. 189 Let's take a step back. 190 And. 191 Let's analyze what the distances are going to be. 192

### Đoạn 49

So at a time, t, we say that if Terrence is moving at a concert velocity, his car will have traveled 193 a distance viti. 194 Right? 195 Makes sense. 196

### Đoạn 50

Simple physics, right? 197 The. 198 Is Delta L or Delta T? 199 If you multiply by Delta T? 200

### Đoạn 51

You get Delta Elm. 201 That's just what that is. 202 Simple physics, baby, simple physics. 203 So he says, Oh, you traveled a distance beat and blue right here. 204

### Đoạn 52

B relative times T. 205 That's going to give me your conception of the car and you're going to tell me that the length you see 206 the ball has traveled is relative to your origin, which is implanted on the car, which the distance 207 from way. 208

### Đoạn 53

Where your origin is right here at the left side of the car to the ball, that's going to be ex prime, 209 right? 210 His reference frame is designated by a prime that's ex prime. 211 But what I see is that. 212

### Đoạn 54

It traveled first this distance. 213 In the car. 214 And then the distance you threw it. 215 So my distance x is going to be x prime plus v t. 216

### Đoạn 55

Which is what we find here. 217 So, OK, that that makes sense. 218 And I want to make a note that when he throws it, it just goes in the X direction. 219 You don't have any change in why it's like, Oh, well, that's cool. 220

### Đoạn 56

Maybe that's why there's a difference. 221 But as for Y and Z Y, your Y is the same as mine. 222 They line up horizontally. 223 Same with Z out of the board. 224

### Đoạn 57

Nothing's changing. 225 There are reference frames in. 226 Not so. 227 What does gives rise to what we just arrived is a very simple idea of relativity, what it says is that 228

### Đoạn 58

you know what? 229 We haven't proved this yet. 230 It says the laws of physics are going to hold their universe, their absolute, they govern nature. 231 Nature will conform to those laws. 232

### Đoạn 59

Whatever. 233 Regardless of what we do. 234 But our perspectives may be changing the phenomena that arise. 235 So in order to come up with this absolute universal conception, we're going to develop this transformation, 236

### Đoạn 60

which we're going to call Gavilan transformation. 237 And it is as follows. 238 So given this, we say, OK, we have this universal conception of the physical phenomena that happened. 239 It's true. 240

### Đoạn 61

Regardless of the reference frame that we choose, it's going to stay true regardless of what we choose. 241 And it is as such. 242 Now we could further generalize this by saying that, oh, this is going to move in a cost velocity 243 in the Z direction or the Y direction. 244

### Đoạn 62

We could that to realize this and say that. 245 Are. 246 You know, Vector R, which is X Y. 247 Z. 248

### Đoạn 63

Sorry about that, guys. 249 Vector like that because they are. 250 Her fill up is equal to the R. 251 It's Prime. 252

### Đoạn 64

That's what the prime designate is with respect to this reference rate, plus the relative velocity 253 times tick. 254 This is going to represent V Zvi v z. 255 So we could have done that. 256

### Đoạn 65

We could have done. 257 And this gives us a nice transformation. 258 What you're saying? 259 Wait, a second, that's just space. 260

### Đoạn 66

How does this affect velocity? 261 How does this affect velocity? 262 So. 263 If we erase our invariants principle. 264

### Đoạn 67

Which we hold to be true, and we want to be true because that is the goal is to assert that malls are 265 universal and crop up in nature regardless of how we perceive them. 266 All I can say is that, oh, we can take this general form are as equal to our prime plus v relative 267 sea, and we can just differentiate this right. 268

### Đoạn 68

Simple count, baby, we could say OK. 269 Are not all transformative, the. 270 Is equal to the prime. 271 The derivative this is a constant remember he's moving out of control velocity. 272

### Đoạn 69

So the derivative of Constantine's is just the constant. 273 And then you say, well. 274 Terrence, you told me the blast, you observed the prime. 275 It's 10 meters per second. 276

### Đoạn 70

I have to add your velocity, which is 60, and that give me my 70. 277 Everything makes sense. 278 Everything makes sense. 279 This is known as the lost the edition. 280

### Đoạn 71

OK, so. 281 What have we done here? 282 What have we really done? 283 We came up with a mechanism. 284

### Đoạn 72

You can conceive of the world to perceive physical phenomena around us in an absolute universe, universal 285 manner. 286 We say that regardless of how we perceive things, regardless of our perspective. 287 It's going to conform to physical laws. 288

### Đoạn 73

And it's going to give rise to the theory that applies regardless of your reference frame. 289 Cool stuff. 290 But what about the invariance principle? 291 How can we show that Newton's laws are the same in each reference frame? 292

### Đoạn 74

That's one of the accomplishments. 293 Of physics. 294 I'm just going to write what I raced right here. 295 Velocity Edition. 296

### Đoạn 75

OK. 297 OK, so all I want to show really is. 298 Philip. 299 Says. 300

### Đoạn 76

I took the baseball. 301 I dropped it on a spring scale. 302 I measured the force that was going on here. 303 Force gravity, my force should be the same as yours if physical laws are going to line up. 304

### Đoạn 77

That's how it has to be. 305 This is the dilemma back in the day for any tiny mechanics. 306 So you might be reasoning that regardless of your preference for him, regardless of your perspective, 307 it seems to be the case that your mass in one reference frame will be the same mass in another reference 308

### Đoạn 78

frame. 309 Seems plausible, right? 310 We cannot create or destroy mass. 311 Conservation of mass. 312

### Đoạn 79

Right. 313 So Philip says let's test this out. 314 Terrence, take the ball, travel as fast as you can, take my spring balanced, so the same instrument 315 shot that baseball on it in measure it. 316

### Đoạn 80

Tell me your force. 317 We want to find that this is equal to that the forces in both reference frame are equal. 318 So. 319 When he does this. 320

### Đoạn 81

But the spring balanced, he says, Oh, the horses are equal. 321 That seems plausible. 322 We've all probably done that, and we probably consider that subconsciously based upon what we observed 323 in the world in front of us, based upon how physical phenomena has transpired around us. 324

### Đoạn 82

So you could probably agree that. 325 Masses in variance in your reference frames. 326 For now, and you're probably thinking since he married it. 327 The tool does not lie. 328

### Đoạn 83

So this is true. 329 But what about acceleration? 330 What about acceleration? 331 Acceleration must be the same. 332

### Đoạn 84

To make that line up. 333 Right. 334 So if we take this, we can differentiate it again. 335 Note that the relative is a constant. 336

### Đoạn 85

And we end up with a sequel to a Prime. 337 What that means is we get that this. 338 Is equivalent 339 f equals Emma looks like invariance has held up our physical laws to give rise to inertial effects the 340

### Đoạn 86

universal. 341 Philip and Terence are happy. 342 The only thing they are unhappy about. 343 Is space their conception of space? 344

### Đoạn 87

And they came up with this nice universal conception to measure it? 345 OK, so you might be thinking that's almost that's all fine and dandy shirtless, either. 346 This cannot be the theory of special relativity. 347 That's an interesting and I agree with you. 348

### Đoạn 88

It's not super interesting. 349 So what's the problem? 350 Well, my question for you is. 351 This little experiment here, does this encompass every possible situation that can arise in the universe 352

### Đoạn 89

because of physical theory is true. 353 What it should do is it should converge on every situation that can happen. 354 That is the ultimate test for any physical theory. 355 Can this encompass every situation, what I'm going to say is, no, we have not tested every single 356

### Đoạn 90

situation that could arise, and in particular, we have not checked that in variance is true for every 357 physical law. 358 OK, so next, what we're going to do is I'm going to outline the main dilemma back in the day that 359 was presented, which challenged Einstein and gave him a run for his money and allowed him to become 360

### Đoạn 91

the famous physicist he is today.
