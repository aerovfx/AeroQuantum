1
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,080
OK, so what's the big dilemma here?

2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,870
We developed this nice theory of relativity.

3
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:31,130
It helps bridge the gap between different perspectives and gives us this universal absolute conception

4
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:31,730
of the universe.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,770
What could possibly go wrong?

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,630
My question for you is invariance tells us that physical physical laws should be universal across reference

7
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,080
frames.

8
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,380
They should always crop up in the same manner, regardless of our perspective, regardless of how we

9
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,740
perceive the event transpiring in front of our eyes.

10
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:58,760
But we've only taken a look at Newtonian laws, Newtonian mechanics.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,710
F equals M-A and all the results that fall out because of that easily inertial ideas.

12
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:15,170
So what about a theory that was developed after this in an electricity magnetism?

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,340
What about that?

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:27,230
If our physical laws were good, if the theory was very universal absolute, we would expect that Maxwell's

15
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:34,790
equations, which govern all of ENM and we've shown give us valid results in numerous experiments.

16
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,740
People were very confident that.

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,430
Those laws should be invariant between reference frame.

18
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:49,470
What I'm going to say is there's a little dilemma, and this is what gave rise to a lot of the questions

19
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:58,170
in the late 1800s and early 1900s which Einstein resolved with his theory of special relativity.

20
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,940
What was the issue now?

21
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:07,050
As I've just said, you would have hoped that ENM the physical laws would be invariant to reference

22
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,590
frames.

23
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,790
And that they would conform to this theory of relativity we just put together.

24
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,070
And furthermore, since Ian was newer, people clung to this theory of relativity.

25
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:24,400
This Newtonian result because there have been proven time and time again, it could not be wrong.

26
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,620
But here's the problem.

27
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,370
Maxwell's equations assert that the speed of light, the speed in which light moves.

28
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,530
Is always constant.

29
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,030
Why is that?

30
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:37,870
Because.

31
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,860
He asserts that the speed of light sea is equal to one over the square root of these constants epsilon,

32
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:54,370
not new, not F1, not is the permit tivity of vacuum, while new not is the permeability of vacuum.

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,340
So can you see the problem here?

34
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,540
This is the constant, regardless of what you want to say.

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,880
But if this is a constant.

36
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,490
If somebody in a movie reference frame shoots out a beam of light.

37
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,190
This guy.

38
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,620
It says that.

39
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,360
The guy who's not moving will measure a different velocity.

40
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,030
But it's supposed to be constant.

41
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,890
What is going on here?

42
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,680
This was so troubling at the time, and I'll illustrate in the new example right here just shortly,

43
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,870
but this was so troubling at the time that scientists started coming up with fabricated ideas and theories

44
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,910
and entities to try to explain this.

45
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,660
But at the time, they respected this theory because it was Newtonian, was classical.

46
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,900
It had more supporting evidence or so they thought, so what they said is, mmm, this law cannot be

47
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,000
invariant across reference frames.

48
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,150
What we're going to say is that there's some unique frame in which the speed of light is a constant

49
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,450
defined by Maxwell's equations and Maxwell's equations hold.

50
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,750
But another reference frames it may be different to account for this theory, and that's how they bridge

51
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,210
the gap.

52
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:21,890
What they said was that, Hey, look, lane is a wave, and from our previous experience, we've observed

53
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:29,150
that a lot of waves, such as water waves and water and sound waves in air, they have to propagate

54
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,530
through a medium.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,520
Guess what?

56
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,410
Light is going to do the same thing.

57
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,270
It must do the same thing.

58
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:43,250
So there must be this unique entity, which we're going to call the Lumina lumen for us, this ether

59
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,930
or ether for short.

60
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:53,430
This is going to be some medium, which is heavenly, given the name either some divine fabricated force

61
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:00,120
that we came up with in our minds and light is going to have to propagate through that and only in that

62
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,990
reference frame.

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,490
Does this hold?

64
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,460
Only now reference frames of Maxwell's equations.

65
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,310
Come right.

66
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,800
Hold up at play.

67
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,360
So.

68
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,180
This was a problem, and what scientists want to do is they wanted to come up with an experiment with

69
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:30,120
a tool that could precisely measure light super precisely in such a way that they could find some difference

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,620
in the velocity and different records.

71
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,540
So they said, OK.

72
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,360
Let's take the Earth.

73
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,230
The Earth is moving at a speed, we know the speed we can predict that.

74
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,230
Kepler's laws from orbital mechanics, we are confident in that result.

75
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,660
Let's put together a tool that could measure it on the Earth.

76
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:59,530
And what we assert is that in the ether, which surrounds the Earth, the light must propagate through.

77
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
It's going to be this value.

78
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,420
It's going to be.

79
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,060
3.00 times, 10 to the eight meters per second.

80
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,540
The very precise measurement.

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,370
What on the Earth?

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,890
It's going to be.

83
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,530
Going to be.

84
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,390
So the guy named Nicholson.

85
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,020
It was also or later assisted by a guy named Morley.

86
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:41,020
And they did an experiment which became known as the Mikkelson Warley Experiment, a drought developed

87
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,760
what is known as an interferometer and Mikkelson in 1880.

88
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,770
What he did was he tried to measure the speed of light, and he thought it would give a different value

89
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,490
than this because the Earth was moving.

90
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:55,940
Right.

91
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,890
We are in a different reference frame.

92
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,180
So in essence, you tried to find this guy.

93
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,820
What did he find?

94
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,830
His instrument was super precise, and he should have found a difference.

95
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:18,720
But regardless of where he did it, regardless of how he did it, regardless of the time of day he did

96
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
it, he always got that result.

97
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,630
When he published this, scientists blew up, they're like, what?

98
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,300
No.

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,300
Our theory is this cannot be right.

100
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,410
You do not do your experiment correctly.

101
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,090
You do it again.

102
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,290
You kept repeating it and repeating it and finding that this was true.

103
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:46,820
So they had the answer right in front of them, but they came up with this fabricated idea to explain

104
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:46,970
it.

105
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:53,110
It's fabricated concession and the greatest lesson you can get out of this.

106
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:01,870
This history lesson is that physics is intended to observe physical phenomenon and then develop theories

107
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:08,800
which describe what you see as soon as you start prescribing how nature should behave.

108
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,930
You get led down the wrong path, and that's what happened in this situation, because we had the answer

109
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:20,320
right here at these walls are invariant in any kind of reference frame, but they refused to believe

110
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,470
it because they are trying to mold nature and come up with these ideas, these fictional entities,

111
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,150
to make the theories work.

112
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,050
Why don't you do that?

113
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,610
You run into problems.

114
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,460
Name of the game is observe, develop theories to describe what you observe.

115
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,870
That's how you do.

116
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,710
Good science.

117
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,180
OK, so.

118
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,490
What was the dilemma here?

119
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,950
I'm going to illustrate for you with Terence and Phillip and a mother, Duncan, a thought experiment,

120
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,690
as I would say.

121
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,070
So in this case, we have the same set up.

122
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,750
We have parents and Philip originally at the same origin.

123
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,580
They calibrate their clocks.

124
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,250
We think that the time is going to be the same.

125
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:08,340
And this time, parents of Philip were like, Hey, let's put out this experiment, baby, I'm going

126
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,390
to get a Star Wars ship and I'm going to put a blaster on the front.

127
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,390
Let's measure light instead of a baseball that's child's play.

128
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,120
And we got this nice theory here.

129
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,950
We know what's going to happen already, so at time, T equals zero.

130
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:34,500
Pam parents instantly goes a speed of point ninety five times the speed of light, super fast, almost

131
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,150
close to the speed of light.

132
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,720
And what he does, he says, I'm going to push a button.

133
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,400
I'm going to fire this laser gun.

134
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,530
It's like I'm in Star Wars, baby.

135
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,280
It's going to be awesome.

136
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,430
That's why has this awesome, awkward smirk on his face.

137
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,560
He pushes the button and you fill up his Allen out of space.

138
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,560
He's watching it, and he's running down some theory based upon his new Galilean transformation.

139
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,780
And he says parents.

140
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,390
Getting your measurement, and I'm going to be able to figure out what it should be before I measure

141
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:07,540
it.

142
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,750
I am so confident in my theories.

143
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,960
I'm not even going to listen to what's going on right in front of me.

144
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,610
So Terrence hits the button.

145
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,730
He measures the laser who flies out.

146
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,120
He says, Oh, it's going to be tough.

147
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,250
See, you must be going through the ether.

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,810
It's going through the ether.

149
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,010
I found the ether baby.

150
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,900
We're going to make history.

151
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,100
He calls up Philip.

152
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,210
He's like, Yeah, let's see.

153
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,630
And feels like I'm so excited, so excited.

154
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:40,620
I'm going to figure out what I'm going to measure it as physics says it's going to be V.

155
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,920
Oh, it's.

156
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,380
It should be B plus B, relative.

157
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,060
We nine people see it should be 1.5 C.

158
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,660
We super exciting.

159
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,150
Throwing it up, he's got his pen.

160
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,830
This is what it is.

161
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,160
As you can see with this big red line.

162
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,310
That's not what it is.

163
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,320
It's not what it is.

164
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,960
In actuality.

165
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,370
In actuality, it measures the light.

166
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,840
And let's see.

167
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,200
What's going on here?

168
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,970
What's going on here?

169
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:31,800
Instantly, just like the scientists, they start saying, oh, no, something is wrong with the announcements.

170
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,370
They were not measuring it.

171
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:33,600
Correct?

172
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,140
Let's do it again.

173
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,980
Only we go far.

174
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,760
They found less.

175
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,650
They failed to realize that this is what we observed, so that's what it is.

176
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,250
Trust, nature, but verify.

177
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,740
So what they found is that.

178
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,280
Yes, Maxwell's equations are invariant in the universe.

179
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,190
And this was the main dilemma of the time.

180
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,520
People could not understand why this theory was from.

181
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,260
And then Einstein came around and he said.

182
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,870
Guys, it's right in front of us, right in front of us.

183
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,130
You need to take your educated mind, your program and mine.

184
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,030
What do you expect to see?

185
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:23,730
And throw it in the garbage?

186
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,960
Do not expect, observe, develop.

187
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,790
And then critique.

188
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,550
Do not control reality.

189
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,160
Nature will not conform to your wishes.

190
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,560
It will not conform to your imagination.

191
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,510
It will not conform to what you want.

192
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,190
There is no ether.

193
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,330
There is no special, fabricated idea.

194
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,130
Get out of here, guys.

195
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,080
What I'm going to say is that our conception of space and time is not quite right.

196
00:12:54,310 --> 00:13:00,280
We haven't seen the full picture yet, and that is exactly what happened in his paper he published in

197
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,260
1985.

198
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,960
What he asserted is that space time is going to bend or change.

199
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,360
To compensate for this fact.

200
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,010
But it's only going to arise in certain circumstances.

201
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:26,940
In other words, we're going to reserve that time dilates and length contracts to very important topics.

202
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,110
Keep that in the back of your head.

203
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,860
So that was the main dilemma at the time.

204
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:39,440
This is what perplexed scientists back in the day before Einstein came around, slot them on the piece

205
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,760
and said, Wake up, brother.

206
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,890
The answer's right in front of you.

207
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,530
Stop trying to force reality.

208
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:55,540
Observe and then develop theories to explain what you observe, nature is not trying to trick you.

209
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,330
Nature will not trick you.

210
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,020
OK.

211
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,440
So the next few videos we're going to jump into.

212
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:16,070
What Einstein asserted he was able to resolve this nonsense, this big mess through a very simple experiment

213
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:23,780
and get Donkin OK and through that experiment, he was able to show how our conception of space time

214
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,760
is completely and utterly wrong.

215
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,440
And he changed.

216
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,820
You changed the fabric of physics as we knew it.

217
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,830
But at the same time?

218
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:42,170
He saved ENM in a sense, made everything in that.

219
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:50,560
Came up with a universal apps like Inception and Progressed The Theory of Relativity.

220
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,930
I hope you enjoyed the video.

221
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,810
A lot of background information, not a lot of math, not a lot of physics, but I thought it was important

222
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,100
for you to understand.

223
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:11,830
The dilemma scientists face is it seems simple to us nowadays, but this perplexed everybody for years,

224
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,840
years and I wanted you to appreciate.

225
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,230
How a simple experiment.

226
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,000
Simple facts.

227
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,170
Can divulge so much about the universe.

228
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,570
OK, so I look forward to explaining the special theory of relativity next, going through Einstein's

229
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,100
get Duncan and showing you.

230
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,320
How time dilates and life contracts?

231
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,820
Stay tuned.
