0
1
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,680
All right.
1

2
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,930
Over the past few months, I've been looking at the physics of radar systems in some general background
2

3
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:31,730
information on that, and one topic I came across was how to calculate the Doppler shift frequency of
3

4
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,990
a target that's approaching a radar system at a very fast speed.
4

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,550
Now when you do this radar systems, you know, they emit beams hoping to hit a target.
5

6
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,080
And then those beams come back when you're trying to calculate that frequency.
6

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,850
What frequency you would expect based upon the velocity of that object?
7

8
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:01,670
What you find is that if you fail to include a relativistic effects, if you do not account for Einstein's
8

9
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,270
theory of special relativity, what you calculate will be incorrect.
9

10
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:11,000
It will not conform to what you actually observe in nature.
10

11
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,590
So given that fact, I started reviewing special relativity.
11

12
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,460
Looking into that again, derivations and stuff, I found a very interesting.
12

13
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,860
So I thought, why not teach you guys about special relativity?
13

14
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,540
You'll be fine.
14

15
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:28,010
And you know, this is a very cool topic, one of the coolest topics in physics.
15

16
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:28,600
OK?
16

17
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,010
A lot of Einstein stuff is OK.
17

18
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:38,570
So what I intend to do in this video is I want to provide some background information, some history,
18

19
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:46,820
some background theory and some ideas related to relativity to help you better understand the general
19

20
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:54,410
climate that scientists were encroached in back in the day when Einstein made his breakthrough discovery
20

21
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,780
in a paper he published in Nineteen Oh five.
21

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:05,030
I want you to understand the dilemma everybody faced what they are trying to solve and why.
22

23
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,250
Einstein's pretty straightforward idea, you know, he developed all this stuff.
23

24
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,380
So a very simple thought experiment.
24

25
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:21,080
Why this was such a huge, huge breakthrough in physics, one that segment it physics in half between
25

26
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,230
classical physics and modern physics, in a sense.
26

27
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:29,360
OK, so first and foremost, we're talking about relativity.
27

28
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,600
What exactly is relativity?
28

29
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:41,360
Well, as with most SECTS in physics, most topics in physics, the name conveys the meaning, right?
29

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,910
The terminology conveys the physical phenomena.
30

31
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,210
So this is no different relativity.
31

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,670
If you look at it and break down the word, the main root word here is relative.
32

33
00:02:53,270 --> 00:03:02,690
Relativity is the study of how our perceptions of physical phenomenon, how our conception of the universe
33

34
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,830
and how things transpire in front of us, how that is contingent upon the reference frame from which
34

35
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,140
we conceive it again.
35

36
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,630
Our perceptions are contingent upon our perspective, our reference frame.
36

37
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,140
In essence, if somebody perceives something in a certain way based upon their reference frame and somebody
37

38
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:33,680
else perceive it in a different from a different perspective, the outcomes, the analysis, how they
38

39
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,780
interpret that it may not gel up together.
39

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:45,890
So what relativity is trying to do, it's trying to bridge the gap between perceptions from different
40

41
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:52,940
perspectives such that we can get some universal absolute conception of the universe.
41

42
00:03:53,270 --> 00:04:01,370
Now this can crop up in physics or metaphysical ideas, right in metaphysics, philosophy, opinions,
42

43
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:07,480
even politics, for example, somebody's perception, somebody's interpretation of things.
43

44
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,800
It's based upon their perspective.
44

45
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,000
It's based upon how they saw things, is based upon what information they had available.
45

46
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,150
But in terms of physics, relativity has to do with measurements.
46

47
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,750
OK.
47

48
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,100
The way in which you measure length time, velocity, momentum, so on and so forth.
48

49
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,000
But in particular, space and time.
49

50
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,600
What you find is that.
50

51
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,950
Your conception of your conception of how physical laws are played out in front of your eyes.
51

52
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:48,120
It's contingent upon your perspective is dependent upon your reference frame.
52

53
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:56,220
OK, and this is a very cool idea because what physics is trying to do is we want to divulge the essence
53

54
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,210
of the universe.
54

55
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:03,660
All the physical principles that govern motion govern how things are supposed to be right.
55

56
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,760
Any good physical theory is one that should encompass every event that could happen in the universe.
56

57
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,910
Every perspective that could observe that kind of phenomenon, it should be absolute.
57

58
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,410
It should be universal.
58

59
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:24,000
So any kind of theory of relativity is trying to do that.
59

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,950
It's trying to find its absolute universal conception of reality that bridges differences between perspectives.
60

61
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,460
OK.
61

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,410
And what I'm going to say is that relativity, the conception of it, is very, very old.
62

63
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,130
So it did not come about for the first time in history when I signed developed his theory of special
63

64
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,820
relativity.
64

65
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,210
When it came about was back in the day when Newton was developing his theories.
65

66
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,590
This is a very classical idea, the very classical idea.
66

67
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,110
So what new was trying to do?
67

68
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,760
He wanted all of his laws to be universal across these reference frames.
68

69
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,450
OK.
69

70
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:14,040
And when we observe different phenomena throughout the day and, you know, general terms, things that
70

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,130
are moving at a slow speed, key work, keep that in mind.
71

72
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,880
The back of your head.
72

73
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,840
Slow speed.
73

74
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,110
We find that different perspectives.
74

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,400
You know, they can converge based upon transformations.
75

76
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,720
So what Newton showed first, what he said is that.
76

77
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,440
There is something known as a Galilean invariance.
77

78
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,900
This is part of Newtonian mechanics.
78

79
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,110
What this basically asserts is that physical laws are universal.
79

80
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:49,300
They're absolute regardless of how you perceive something, regardless of your reference frame, regardless
80

81
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,130
of your perspective, the same physical phenomenon will arise.
81

82
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,300
Things will behave as they are governed by physical laws.
82

83
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:58,570
Right.
83

84
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,850
Nature is not going to play a fast one on us.
84

85
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,170
It's not going to try to trick us.
85

86
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,970
So we get into the quantum world.
86

87
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,470
That's what makes it super interesting.
87

88
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:14,110
But in a Newtonian world, Newton's laws are going to rise just as they are so Galilean and variance.
88

89
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:20,740
A formal definition states that if Newton's laws are valid in one reference rate for one person for
89

90
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,700
one perspective, then they are also valid in an in inertial reference frame.
90

91
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:34,570
Key word inertial moving at a constant velocity of relative first system.
91

92
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,020
So.
92

93
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,540
There are special relativity is only for inertial reference frames that are moving at a constant velocity.
93

94
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:48,440
So as you probably learn a physics one to one in inertial reference frames, which the walls are, they
94

95
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,890
are the dominant governing force at play.
95

96
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,300
They always apply.
96

97
00:07:54,230 --> 00:08:02,240
That's why sort of inertial Newton's laws give rise to inertial concepts, and any other reference frame
97

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,600
has to have a constant velocity relative to the first system.
98

99
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:13,730
So to illustrate the initial problem that was faced with Newtonian relativity, which people thought
99

100
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,500
was no big deal, right?
100

101
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,600
They said, Oh, there's this dilemma, they solved it very quickly, which I'll show you in a little
101

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:22,840
bit.
102

103
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,240
They said, this is not interesting.
103

104
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,380
We're not going to look at this ever again until Einstein came around.
104

105
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,850
And a dilemma was presented that he was trying to solve, which I will get to in a second.
105

106
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,340
But let's do a thought experiment.
106

107
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,080
Let's do a thought experiment.
107

108
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,380
Let's see if we had multiple perspectives.
108

109
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,680
If the laws are valid.
109

110
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,330
A space and time can relate it in a universal absolute sense.
110

111
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,560
OK.
111

112
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,580
That's the name of the game.
112

113
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:01,720
So to do this, what we're going to do is we're going to say we've got two people who are going to conduct
113

114
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,470
this experiment.
114

115
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:11,710
A guy named Terrence and a guy named Philip Notability MP Al Tarrant's is going to be in a car and he's
115

116
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,160
going to drive at a constant velocity and throw an object and measure.
116

117
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,600
Philip is also going to measure it standing on the ground.
117

118
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:19,990
So.
118

119
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:27,720
Philip and Terence, what they do, they say my reference frames are designated as follows Philip's
119

120
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,890
reference frame, his perspective on the physical phenomenon transpiring all around him is going to
120

121
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,990
be a reference frame.
121

122
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,020
S and Terence is going to be a reference frame.
122

123
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:45,060
S Prime Atari's is only going to move in the X direction.
123

124
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,660
Not going to move in the wide direction or the Z direction coming out of the board.
124

125
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:57,810
But the S reference frame is going to have an X and Y system at the origin and before the experiment
125

126
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,590
is conducted.
126

127
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,140
What Terence is going to do is say, Hey, I have a clock.
127

128
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,880
Philip has a clock.
128

129
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,460
We're going to synchronize that clock.
129

130
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,280
This references system is primed for Terrence was designated by 02 y prime.
130

131
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:24,010
So it's going to be fixed through this car, but initially it's going to line up with the origin up.
131

132
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:27,610
So Terrence is origin, which is going to move the car.
132

133
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,650
I'll call Oprah Prime.
133

134
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,130
His origin is going to be as follows.
134

135
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,620
So first, Tenet.
135

136
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,700
Of relativity back in the day, Newtonian relativity, if you will, you could probably agree that.
136

137
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,910
The time for fill up is going to be the same time as parents, provided that they sync up, right?
137

138
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,380
For example, if we both have a clock which is calibrated properly, the good tool, good instrument,
138

139
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,240
we set it together.
139

140
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,880
I stay at home and I tell you, hey, take your watch.
140

141
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,680
Go to the supermarket.
141

142
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,850
Keep track of your time.
142

143
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,380
Pick up some chicken.
143

144
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:18,030
We'll make some Chinese food when you come back, something like that when he comes back.
144

145
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,410
You and I would agree.
145

146
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:20,790
We would agree.
146

147
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,820
Time would be the same our watches would match provided that the tool was precise.
147

148
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,320
That's not surprising.
148

149
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,640
That's a given fact of life that we observe every day.
149

150
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,960
So that's not surprising.
150

151
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,020
So Terence and Phillip, they're going to do that.
151

152
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,990
They're going to synchronize their watch at time.
152

153
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,980
T equals zero.
153

154
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,880
And right when they want to start the experiment, parents.
154

155
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:53,400
He's going to hit a pedal that makes him automatically go the speed of V v relative, in this case,
155

156
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,560
we're going to go 60 meters per second.
156

157
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,540
And they're going to start their time launches at the same exact time, so their time will be universal.
157

158
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:12,070
So the transformation that's going to relate time a team breakfast frame as prime in this.
158

159
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,690
Time tea for fill up.
159

160
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,580
It's going to be the same as Prime.
160

161
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,410
Returns not surprising now.
161

162
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,780
Terrence, you guys are speeding off.
162

163
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,020
Then he's going to throw a baseball right here.
163

164
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,160
And he's going to measure it, so Terrence throws it.
164

165
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,140
Throws the ball, shoe flies out, Terrance says.
165

166
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,520
Look at that smirk, baby.
166

167
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm going to measure that baseball.
167

168
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,150
It's 10 meters per second, it's 10 meters per second, so he gets a call to his buddy.
168

169
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:52,990
Hey bro.
169

170
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,100
Yo, Philip.
170

171
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,640
I measured the speed, it's 10 meters per second.
171

172
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,010
What did you measure, would you measure?
172

173
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,460
Well, Philip says, Oh, oh, my God, what are you talking about then?
173

174
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,110
You're lying to me, bro.
174

175
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,340
You're lying to me.
175

176
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,790
I see so many meters per second.
176

177
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,010
What's going on here?
177

178
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,780
Has the universe?
178

179
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,320
Played a trick on Terrence and Philip.
179

180
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,570
Well, you're probably thinking this is sort of silly.
180

181
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,880
And right now it is silly because.
181

182
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,890
We know that.
182

183
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,550
And I'm going to show you very shortly that, you know, we just take the velocity of this and add the
183

184
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,730
velocity of that 60 plus 10 gives us 70.
184

185
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,500
And we're used to that because we're used to everyday events transpiring in front of us.
185

186
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:50,170
I say kids are like the best physicists because they observe everything there of how things are going
186

187
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,920
to operate and then form their own theories related to it.
187

188
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,520
They would have.
188

189
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,520
Form some kind of theatre related, but since they disagree, what they say is, oh, well, let's.
189

190
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,700
Let's take a step back.
190

191
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,380
And.
191

192
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,740
Let's analyze what the distances are going to be.
192

193
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:22,930
So at a time, t, we say that if Terrence is moving at a concert velocity, his car will have traveled
193

194
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,950
a distance viti.
194

195
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:25,830
Right?
195

196
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,470
Makes sense.
196

197
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,620
Simple physics, right?
197

198
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:29,910
The.
198

199
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,170
Is Delta L or Delta T?
199

200
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,450
If you multiply by Delta T?
200

201
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,720
You get Delta Elm.
201

202
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,770
That's just what that is.
202

203
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,680
Simple physics, baby, simple physics.
203

204
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,700
So he says, Oh, you traveled a distance beat and blue right here.
204

205
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,810
B relative times T.
205

206
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,680
That's going to give me your conception of the car and you're going to tell me that the length you see
206

207
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,340
the ball has traveled is relative to your origin, which is implanted on the car, which the distance
207

208
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,240
from way.
208

209
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,140
Where your origin is right here at the left side of the car to the ball, that's going to be ex prime,
209

210
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,380
right?
210

211
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,560
His reference frame is designated by a prime that's ex prime.
211

212
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,480
But what I see is that.
212

213
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,220
It traveled first this distance.
213

214
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,660
In the car.
214

215
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,810
And then the distance you threw it.
215

216
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,890
So my distance x is going to be x prime plus v t.
216

217
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,650
Which is what we find here.
217

218
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,020
So, OK, that that makes sense.
218

219
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,950
And I want to make a note that when he throws it, it just goes in the X direction.
219

220
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:51,370
You don't have any change in why it's like, Oh, well, that's cool.
220

221
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,990
Maybe that's why there's a difference.
221

222
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:58,600
But as for Y and Z Y, your Y is the same as mine.
222

223
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,090
They line up horizontally.
223

224
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,010
Same with Z out of the board.
224

225
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,660
Nothing's changing.
225

226
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,170
There are reference frames in.
226

227
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,120
Not so.
227

228
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:15,580
What does gives rise to what we just arrived is a very simple idea of relativity, what it says is that
228

229
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,540
you know what?
229

230
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,740
We haven't proved this yet.
230

231
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,520
It says the laws of physics are going to hold their universe, their absolute, they govern nature.
231

232
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,490
Nature will conform to those laws.
232

233
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,300
Whatever.
233

234
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,460
Regardless of what we do.
234

235
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,420
But our perspectives may be changing the phenomena that arise.
235

236
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:45,110
So in order to come up with this absolute universal conception, we're going to develop this transformation,
236

237
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,200
which we're going to call Gavilan transformation.
237

238
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,850
And it is as follows.
238

239
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,440
So given this, we say, OK, we have this universal conception of the physical phenomena that happened.
239

240
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,260
It's true.
240

241
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,150
Regardless of the reference frame that we choose, it's going to stay true regardless of what we choose.
241

242
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,800
And it is as such.
242

243
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,560
Now we could further generalize this by saying that, oh, this is going to move in a cost velocity
243

244
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,500
in the Z direction or the Y direction.
244

245
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,330
We could that to realize this and say that.
245

246
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,320
Are.
246

247
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,350
You know, Vector R, which is X Y.
247

248
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,260
Z.
248

249
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,000
Sorry about that, guys.
249

250
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,740
Vector like that because they are.
250

251
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,380
Her fill up is equal to the R.
251

252
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,080
It's Prime.
252

253
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,210
That's what the prime designate is with respect to this reference rate, plus the relative velocity
253

254
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,830
times tick.
254

255
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,660
This is going to represent V Zvi v z.
255

256
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,970
So we could have done that.
256

257
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,350
We could have done.
257

258
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,270
And this gives us a nice transformation.
258

259
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,710
What you're saying?
259

260
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,040
Wait, a second, that's just space.
260

261
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,800
How does this affect velocity?
261

262
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,450
How does this affect velocity?
262

263
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,410
So.
263

264
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,510
If we erase our invariants principle.
264

265
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:24,680
Which we hold to be true, and we want to be true because that is the goal is to assert that malls are
265

266
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,010
universal and crop up in nature regardless of how we perceive them.
266

267
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:42,230
All I can say is that, oh, we can take this general form are as equal to our prime plus v relative
267

268
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,620
sea, and we can just differentiate this right.
268

269
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,040
Simple count, baby, we could say OK.
269

270
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,040
Are not all transformative, the.
270

271
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,070
Is equal to the prime.
271

272
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,440
The derivative this is a constant remember he's moving out of control velocity.
272

273
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,560
So the derivative of Constantine's is just the constant.
273

274
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,710
And then you say, well.
274

275
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,480
Terrence, you told me the blast, you observed the prime.
275

276
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,660
It's 10 meters per second.
276

277
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,880
I have to add your velocity, which is 60, and that give me my 70.
277

278
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,670
Everything makes sense.
278

279
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,410
Everything makes sense.
279

280
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,390
This is known as the lost the edition.
280

281
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,010
OK, so.
281

282
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,150
What have we done here?
282

283
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,310
What have we really done?
283

284
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,820
We came up with a mechanism.
284

285
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:55,930
You can conceive of the world to perceive physical phenomena around us in an absolute universe, universal
285

286
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,260
manner.
286

287
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,920
We say that regardless of how we perceive things, regardless of our perspective.
287

288
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,710
It's going to conform to physical laws.
288

289
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:12,470
And it's going to give rise to the theory that applies regardless of your reference frame.
289

290
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,790
Cool stuff.
290

291
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,980
But what about the invariance principle?
291

292
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:24,130
How can we show that Newton's laws are the same in each reference frame?
292

293
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,690
That's one of the accomplishments.
293

294
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,050
Of physics.
294

295
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,320
I'm just going to write what I raced right here.
295

296
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,270
Velocity Edition.
296

297
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,470
OK.
297

298
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,010
OK, so all I want to show really is.
298

299
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,360
Philip.
299

300
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:44,800
Says.
300

301
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,610
I took the baseball.
301

302
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,190
I dropped it on a spring scale.
302

303
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,810
I measured the force that was going on here.
303

304
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:01,720
Force gravity, my force should be the same as yours if physical laws are going to line up.
304

305
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,370
That's how it has to be.
305

306
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,900
This is the dilemma back in the day for any tiny mechanics.
306

307
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,550
So you might be reasoning that regardless of your preference for him, regardless of your perspective,
307

308
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:25,170
it seems to be the case that your mass in one reference frame will be the same mass in another reference
308

309
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,540
frame.
309

310
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,790
Seems plausible, right?
310

311
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,950
We cannot create or destroy mass.
311

312
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,070
Conservation of mass.
312

313
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,430
Right.
313

314
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,630
So Philip says let's test this out.
314

315
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:49,130
Terrence, take the ball, travel as fast as you can, take my spring balanced, so the same instrument
315

316
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,740
shot that baseball on it in measure it.
316

317
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,030
Tell me your force.
317

318
00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:02,350
We want to find that this is equal to that the forces in both reference frame are equal.
318

319
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,240
So.
319

320
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,970
When he does this.
320

321
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,960
But the spring balanced, he says, Oh, the horses are equal.
321

322
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,560
That seems plausible.
322

323
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:22,700
We've all probably done that, and we probably consider that subconsciously based upon what we observed
323

324
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,600
in the world in front of us, based upon how physical phenomena has transpired around us.
324

325
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,390
So you could probably agree that.
325

326
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,260
Masses in variance in your reference frames.
326

327
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,210
For now, and you're probably thinking since he married it.
327

328
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,440
The tool does not lie.
328

329
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,270
So this is true.
329

330
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,980
But what about acceleration?
330

331
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,390
What about acceleration?
331

332
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,040
Acceleration must be the same.
332

333
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,730
To make that line up.
333

334
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:57,490
Right.
334

335
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,310
So if we take this, we can differentiate it again.
335

336
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,860
Note that the relative is a constant.
336

337
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,200
And we end up with a sequel to a Prime.
337

338
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,250
What that means is we get that this.
338

339
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,870
Is equivalent
339

340
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:28,220
f equals Emma looks like invariance has held up our physical laws to give rise to inertial effects the
340

341
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,910
universal.
341

342
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,520
Philip and Terence are happy.
342

343
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:34,850
The only thing they are unhappy about.
343

344
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,320
Is space their conception of space?
344

345
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,340
And they came up with this nice universal conception to measure it?
345

346
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,380
OK, so you might be thinking that's almost that's all fine and dandy shirtless, either.
346

347
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,170
This cannot be the theory of special relativity.
347

348
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,900
That's an interesting and I agree with you.
348

349
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,610
It's not super interesting.
349

350
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,500
So what's the problem?
350

351
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,480
Well, my question for you is.
351

352
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:10,420
This little experiment here, does this encompass every possible situation that can arise in the universe
352

353
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,700
because of physical theory is true.
353

354
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,740
What it should do is it should converge on every situation that can happen.
354

355
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:21,670
That is the ultimate test for any physical theory.
355

356
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:32,410
Can this encompass every situation, what I'm going to say is, no, we have not tested every single
356

357
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:39,370
situation that could arise, and in particular, we have not checked that in variance is true for every
357

358
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,420
physical law.
358

359
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:49,240
OK, so next, what we're going to do is I'm going to outline the main dilemma back in the day that
359

360
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:55,900
was presented, which challenged Einstein and gave him a run for his money and allowed him to become
360

361
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,500
the famous physicist he is today.
