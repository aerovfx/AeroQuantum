1
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,570
All right.

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,000
At this point in the course, we've taken a brief look at Newtonian relativity and the sort of relative

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,490
questions we asked back in the day.

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,500
And technically, we are ready to really dive into that wacky world of special relativity.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,490
However, before proceeding, what I want to do is run through an example problem with you in terms

6
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,700
of Galilean relativity and the Galilean transformation.

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,520
And then I want to give you an opportunity to run through problems yourself and to check your understanding

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,810
of these ideas.

9
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,090
And the reason why is twofold.

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:01:00,270
First, the Galilean transformation and Newtonian relativity, as it is as stated, as we've studied

11
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:09,780
so far, it does provide value and it can provide analytical process, even if there are problems associated

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,250
with it, right?

13
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,380
We saw that problem started to crop up when we started looking at velocities and speeds close to the

14
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,130
speed of light.

15
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:17,820
All right.

16
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,610
However, if we look at situations that are in tune with what we typically see, such as, you know,

17
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,390
a car driving by lower velocities, it still does give us good analytical power and allows us to predict

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,950
things and could be useful.

19
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,730
OK, so that's one reason why we want to do it.

20
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,400
The other reason why is because if you can build an understanding of how you solve very simple relativity

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,870
problems where the situations really gel with your intuition, with how you would expect situations

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,390
to unravel in front of your eyes, right?

23
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,110
You can take that same approach the ideas you put forth and develop in solving these problems.

24
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,770
And that can help you to better solve special relativity problems when your intuition is thrown out

25
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,610
of the window and it's harder to decipher what really is going on, right?

26
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,510
So if you feel really comfortable with this material, feel free to skip ahead.

27
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,850
Skip the quiz, jump to the next section.

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,460
But I would highly advocate taking a look at this example problem we're going to run through now and

29
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,000
running through the exercises I provide after this video OK.

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,080
So let's jump straight into the problem, the problem we're going to discuss today.

31
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,900
The example problem is a classical physics problem you usually see in an introductory physics class.

32
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,480
And that's the problem of how do you really reconcile the different velocities of somebody in a boat,

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,910
a boat who's moving across a river with a stream that's pulling it along?

34
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,570
OK, so I'm going to read the problem statement and then we're going to jump into each section of the

35
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,080
problem so that the problem we're going to look at states that a river has a width of de equal to 40

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,350
meters and water flowing at a constant velocity V equals negative six.

37
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,290
I means negative six in the extraction.

38
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,180
If you have not seen that in notation before the units from that our meters per second.

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,750
What is with respect to a frame of reference that rest?

40
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,410
S.

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,720
OK, so it's going to be tied to the ground and that's what you would observe if you were standing on

42
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,140
the ground.

43
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,140
The first thing you want to make note of in any kind of relativity problem, the Galilean transformation

44
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:32,330
problem or special relativity is the fact that we had a constant velocity, right?

45
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:38,610
These ideas, and especially in special relativity, as we're going to find, only apply if we have

46
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:39,570
a cause of velocity.

47
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:45,660
Once that velocity starts fluctuating, these ideas break down and you can't use exactly what we derive

48
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,110
previously.

49
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,460
So that's an important fact.

50
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,280
Let's continue the problem statement.

51
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:57,090
It's across the river from point A to point B, but the bop fill up right now is joining us again in

52
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:57,630
this problem.

53
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,840
Decides to row his boat with a velocity v equal to positive for J meters per second.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,620
That's in the Y direction straight up means.

55
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,900
Second, with respect to the water.

56
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,810
OK, so that's how he's rowing across in this boat here.

57
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,750
And his partner, Terrence also decides to observe what's happening in this river.

58
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:26,310
He's going to observe this event while cycling on a bike across the river at a cost of Alaska V is equal

59
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:32,250
to plus two positive 2J again up in the Y direction meters per second.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,410
Now we're going to be multiple parts past this problem.

61
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,960
The first one, and we're going to consider right now is part a what is the velocity to the vote of

62
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,380
the boat?

63
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,500
According to someone on the ground standing here?

64
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,130
So how do we approach any kind of relativity problem?

65
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:54,270
Whenever you jump into a relativity problem, your path to success lies in identifying the different

66
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,100
reference frames keeping track of them and being organized.

67
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,460
OK?

68
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,780
So let's do that first.

69
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,470
The way in which I like to solve these problems is I like to have a column on my sheet, a given column

70
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,540
where I label all the different information and helped make sense of it.

71
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:19,080
Help make sense of what has been given to me, so we have quite a few big losses that are given here,

72
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,000
let's try to make sense of what's going on and label things.

73
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,230
The first thing we know is that we have water flowing out a concept velocity in the negative x direction.

74
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,280
And that's this last year.

75
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,270
So we have water here.

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,430
It's going to pull the boat to the left, and we know that somebody's on the water would have a different

77
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,500
reference rate and different interpretation of events than somebody on the ground.

78
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,580
OK, so the first thing we're to do is we're going to label that and I'm not sure the label system.

79
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,530
I like to use both the relativity and when you start getting into things like robotics and mechanical

80
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,010
engineering.

81
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,610
So what I'm going to say is I'm going to say the velocity.

82
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,050
All the water.

83
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:05,060
With respect to the ground, so this is how I read it, and then this notation is going to the power

84
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,060
of it is going to become clearer as we start working through the problem.

85
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,280
I think it makes it nice and easy to really figure out what reference frame is doing what.

86
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,690
So we're going to write this down.

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:23,990
OK, so the water with respect to the Ground G is going to be this vector is going to be negative six

88
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,700
in the eye or extraction meters per second.

89
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,690
All right.

90
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,690
So we got one velocity and that's a cause of velocity.

91
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:39,920
We know that Philip is in the boat also, and he's going a paddle with respect to the water with a velocity

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,050
of positive four j meters per second, basically in the Y direction up on the board.

93
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,040
So what we're going to do is, well, that's the velocity of fill up in the boat.

94
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,870
So we're going to use the same notation.

95
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,620
We're going to say the velocity of fill up.

96
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,490
So up with respect to what with respect to the water, OK, with respect to the water.

97
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,540
So here we had lost water to the ground.

98
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,870
This is going to be the velocity of fill up with respect to the water that's given as what?

99
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,420
Well, we can just reach the a border that's a positive for J.

100
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,580
Meters per second.

101
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,360
OK, so we got two of the three ingredients in this problem.

102
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,070
And the next lawsuit we have on the board is this guy here that's going to be parents.

103
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:36,260
That's how it's going to be cycling across this bridge as he watches this event.

104
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:43,970
So what we can say is that's no different than the velocity of parents with respect to what respect

105
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:44,600
to the ground, right?

106
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,520
He's moving with respect to the ground.

107
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,850
And as you see, as you work through these problems, the hard part is identifying the frame that's

108
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:59,960
moving, identifying the Fremont rest, which is the ground in this case and then identifying any other

109
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:07,430
reference frames and figuring out the losses, what that is in respect to with respect to this guy.

110
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Going back to the problem, Terrence, this back to the ground, we have another positive to J meters

111
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,300
per second.

112
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,720
OK.

113
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:24,290
The only thing you can do is you can have a column is looking for specifying what exactly you're looking

114
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,650
for.

115
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,510
I'm going to skip that in this video just to open up more space for us.

116
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,020
But now we go back to the question, we want to find the velocity of a boat according to someone on

117
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,560
the ground.

118
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,280
OK, so what we want is we can use the same notation.

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,110
We want really the velocity of the other boats back to the ground.

120
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,700
And what we're going to use is the velocity addition equation we derive previously.

121
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,050
So refresh your memory.

122
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,600
That guy was velocity of.

123
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:05,200
Something I grasp on the rest frame around is equal to the velocity, the relative velocity measured

124
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,420
by somebody in the moving reference frame.

125
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,100
Plus the velocity of that moving reference.

126
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,370
That's what we do right now, we're going to take this.

127
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,920
We're going to fly to this problem, OK, so if we're looking for the velocity of the boat according

128
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,370
to somebody on the ground, what we're going to do is we're say, OK, that's in the reference for it.

129
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,890
That's at rest on the ground.

130
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,210
That would be this guy, right?

131
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,600
So we're going to write down velocity, the vertical, some on the ground.

132
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,500
So that's going to be fill up this back to the ground.

133
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,190
Now read the question OK, how do we figure that out?

134
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,610
Well, we know a relative last year, right?

135
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,600
This relative velocity will be fill up with respect to the water, right?

136
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,700
Because he's in the moving reference frame.

137
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,260
Let me break it down for you.

138
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,550
We're standing here.

139
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,320
This is the reference frame that's moving.

140
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,460
It's moving up.

141
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,790
It's moving up the East Coast velocity, according to fill up.

142
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,880
And we know that it's in a reference frame that's moving.

143
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:04,660
OK.

144
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,470
So.

145
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,700
We say the moving reference frame.

146
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,440
It's going to be VP with respect to water.

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,080
Neither vectors.

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,850
And then the relative reference frame.

149
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,130
Well, the relative reference frame is going to be what frame is pull up and he's in the frame of the

150
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,000
water and we know the velocity of that reference frame with respect to the ground.

151
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,300
Right.

152
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:33,610
So that becomes the water with respect to the ground.

153
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,930
So the way in which we set this up is we come right across here, we can identify all our reference

154
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,380
frames.

155
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,250
We can identify what they're measured with respect to.

156
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:46,280
And what's really cool with this notation is that.

157
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,560
If you want to find some velocity, that's Kopano combined with other velocities, what you can do is

158
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,940
you take this got these ratios, so it's sort of like PE with respect to W, and it can sort of multiply

159
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,260
them together like this so you can get something like this.

160
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,210
You can't pull that out and you get.

161
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,750
Fill up with respect to ground, so it sort of gives you a way to track these things and find the term

162
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,980
you're really looking for.

163
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,240
OK, so that's the notation I like to use.

164
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:26,270
You can come up with whatever notation you want, but the key idea here is to label everything, be

165
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,090
consistent and chug along.

166
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,140
And you know what?

167
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,900
To make this gel a bit.

168
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,310
Well, the problem a bit better at the problem.

169
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,200
We're going to take these guys and literally put them on our diagram here.

170
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,950
So this is the W.

171
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,630
With respect to ground.

172
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:43,870
Right.

173
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,820
That's the water, Terrence.

174
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,250
Well, that's larceny of Terrence.

175
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:56,740
With respect to the ground and similarly, this this guy would be VP with respect to the water, but

176
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,760
we don't have a vector on this diagram, so we got that guy there.

177
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:07,780
We're looking for the velocity of the boat fill up, according to ground p with respect to ground.

178
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,890
Now we can literally plug and chug because we have all the other ideas here.

179
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,540
We go back to our given column.

180
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,980
We have the unknowns.

181
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,600
It's plug in shock, baby.

182
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,780
So this is that equal to.

183
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,120
Well, let's plug that guy in.

184
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,520
This is a positive for.

185
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,910
In each direction.

186
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:30,390
And the velocity of the water with respect to the ground.

187
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,800
That's a negative six.

188
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,570
In the I direction.

189
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,130
And the units are all meters per second.

190
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,580
OK.

191
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:52,910
So what we get is we rearrange this in which we usually use vectors where X we go X and one z, we get

192
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:58,580
negative six i plus four J.

193
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,310
Meters per second.

194
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,270
OK.

195
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,670
So it's pretty easy problem.

196
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,600
We took.

197
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,200
What we derive previously, we have faith in this.

198
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,900
There's a constant velocity and then the real challenge is really making sense of the numbers we're

199
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,950
giving, making sense of the scenario and keeping track of everything.

200
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:32,850
If you can do that, if you can label everything and you stay on top of what's going on, then chug

201
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,270
along.

202
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,730
The answer pops right out.

203
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,950
OK, so that's the number we're going to get.

204
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,760
And next what we're going to do, we're going to jump into the next section of the problem.

205
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,270
Try and complicate it a bit further.

206
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,400
Test your knowledge and give you some more practice.

207
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,450
All right.

208
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,930
Now the next thing we want to question and figure out using all the tools we've just developed is Part

209
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,800
B the following.

210
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,930
What is the velocity of the boat?

211
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,590
According to Terrance, as he cycles on the bridge.

212
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,930
Now, in this case, we're going to consider a different set of reference frames, but we can still

213
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,420
use this basic equation here.

214
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,090
And what's really going to guide this problem again?

215
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:20,160
The solution to this part is really labeling everything, being consistent and having a grasp on what's

216
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,780
going on right in front of us, OK?

217
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:29,550
So using this thing and going back to the question at hand, we're trying to figure out the velocity.

218
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:36,210
But according to Terrance, so this is according to a reference frame that is moving.

219
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:43,320
OK, so we know from here is we have about ensuring that ground addressed is equal to a reference frame

220
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:48,240
that's moving the velocity according to that, plus the velocity of that reference frame, OK, the

221
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,230
relative velocity.

222
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,990
So we're trying to figure out this guy, right?

223
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,580
It's the velocity according to somebody as measured in that moving reference frame.

224
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,000
So what we can do is, again, we can just write up something similar to this, OK?

225
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,460
We're concerned with this guy.

226
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:11,220
So we want the velocity of fill up with this to ground.

227
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,200
But now our moving reference frame is parents.

228
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,110
And the one at rest is in ground.

229
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:26,520
OK, so v. prime the measurement, according to the moving reference frame, the guy on the bike, Terrance,

230
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,760
that's going to be literally the velocity of fill up.

231
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,440
With respect to the movie governance and with respect to Terrence.

232
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,440
And then what's left is the velocity of the moving reference.

233
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,170
So that's going to be the velocity of Terrence with this back to the ground.

234
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,650
Right?

235
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,400
As such.

236
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,430
OK.

237
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,080
And.

238
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:00,480
Again, we see that once we label everything we could say, OK, I want people to inspect the ground

239
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,350
that will give us PE with respect to Ji, right?

240
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,180
Because the teaser council, that's the power of this kind of notation, OK?

241
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,610
So we're really interested in one of the variables within this equation.

242
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:20,110
We want to get to the velocity of the boat or fill up, according to talent.

243
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:20,700
Terence.

244
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:27,680
So basically, if the velocity as measured by somebody in the moving reference frame or the prime,

245
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:34,490
so we want to isolate this guy, and if we do that, we have BP with respect to G already and we're

246
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,020
giving or g.

247
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,680
Then the problem gets reduced to a plug and chuck kind of problem.

248
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,880
So let's do that right now.

249
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:41,510
Let's do that.

250
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,800
This should be pretty straightforward.

251
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,880
Once you label everything out and you get a grasp of what's going on.

252
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,100
So we want to isolate this guy here.

253
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:58,220
And when we do that, we end up with VP with respect to T is equal to VP, with respect to the ground.

254
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,820
We just subtract VTi with respect to ground.

255
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,970
We get the following.

256
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,170
OK, so.

257
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,270
What we need to do is just plug in shock, so we got this guy right here, we know that Vector is negative

258
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:22,020
six in the eye direction, plus four in the J Direction meters per second.

259
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:30,050
And again, if you have not seen that notation, eyes just shoot in that direction, J is in that direction.

260
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,270
We like to think in terms of Cartesian coordinate systems, and that helps us understand what's going

261
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:35,480
on.

262
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,910
OK, so now we need to subtract.

263
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:44,520
80th strategy that's two in the J direction, minus two.

264
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,750
J.

265
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,380
Meters per second and all we get is we just.

266
00:17:53,410 --> 00:18:04,050
Combine like terms we get for minus two, so we end up with a result that is negative six high plus

267
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,090
two.

268
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,510
J.

269
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,150
Meters per second.

270
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,240
All right.

271
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:18,820
And that is the velocity of the boat or fill up with respect to the cyclist parents.

272
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,830
OK, so.

273
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,990
What we want to do is we want to take this to see if it makes sense, right?

274
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:36,660
We know on the ground the sky is moving to the left six meters per second and closer to Point B in Y

275
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,760
direction by four meters per second.

276
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,700
If you have a guy that's going in this direction two meters per second, it makes sense that what he

277
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,880
sees in the X direction will be the same as somebody on the ground because he's only moving up in this

278
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,240
direction.

279
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,120
It doesn't change his interpretation of the X direction.

280
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,300
But from the y direction he's already going to.

281
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,620
So according to him, this is going to be slower.

282
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,120
What do you want to think of?

283
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,710
Is having somebody in front of you driving a bit faster in a car, right?

284
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,690
If you're traveling 60 and he's traveling 80, right, he's really going 80.

285
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,850
But to you, it looks like he's not moving as fast because he's only going 20 meters per second.

286
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,120
So this jives, well, our intuition.

287
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,040
And you should do this after you saw relativity problem and it makes you Tony Relativity much easier.

288
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,160
But we jump to special relativity.

289
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,020
We all have that luxury because things won't really jive well with our intuition as we're going to see.

290
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:44,400
That's why the wacky world of special relativity and we have to trust the labeling and the mathematics

291
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,480
and the concepts we derive in subsequent sessions.

292
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:49,830
All right.

293
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,020
Let's jump to the next section of this problem.
