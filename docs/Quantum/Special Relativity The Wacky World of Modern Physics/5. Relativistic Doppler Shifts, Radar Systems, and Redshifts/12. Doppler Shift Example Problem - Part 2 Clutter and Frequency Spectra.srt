1
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:18,570
All right.

2
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,890
Well, I just noted Terrance shoots out his radar gun.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,660
He misses fill up and he's really -- off because he really wants to give you a ticket so he hops

4
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:30,230
into his car and drives after him and shoots the radar gun.

5
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,840
But in this time, he's traveling at a constant 20 meters per second as opposed to being stationary

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,420
and just shooting that gun straight at him.

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:45,020
So what happens is as he's looking at it and he's debugging his radar gun, he's shooting in, what

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,640
he finds is that the change in his frequency is it's a little smaller instead of ten thousand three

9
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,130
hundred and twenty or ten point three two kilohertz.

10
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,150
He finds that he gets a negative five point five two kilohertz, and he thinks that he might be getting

11
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,050
the incorrect result.

12
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,720
So to check that what he does is he quickly runs through the calculation in use, and he's smart now

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,160
because he knows he can use the non relativistic equation based upon what we've done previously in this

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,670
example.

15
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,550
So he immediately jumps to this equation right here, and he just plugs and shrugs.

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,880
OK, so what he gets is he plugs it in here.

17
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,290
He says, OK, all I need to is is one minus the original frequency I'm sending out.

18
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:29,690
It's still, you know, my my waveform is being sent out as 36 gigahertz, so it's one minus thirty

19
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,610
six times 10 to the nine hertz.

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:37,160
And then the delta is just a negative five, five thousand five hundred and twenty hertz.

21
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,430
You plug that baby in there and just divide by the original frequency, which is 36 gigahertz and multiply

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,440
by the speed of light and divide by two.

23
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:49,040
When he does that, he finds that we have a minute.

24
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,970
The last thing you measured is 23 meters per second.

25
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,690
Well, that is not the speed of Philip as we know previously, right?

26
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,270
And it really doesn't make much sense to him to because, you know, he's traveling at 20 meters per

27
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:08,630
second and it doesn't look like he's just changing in front of him in three meters per second.

28
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,400
He's going, it looks like he's going much faster.

29
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,340
So he knows that this is inherently wrong.

30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,680
And this brings us to one little problem you might encounter when you design a radar system because

31
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,080
what you normally see when you send it out, if you look at a spectrum, the spectrum of the different

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,130
frequencies that are being received back with the y axis being the intensity you're seeing that usually

33
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:38,540
you see that you find your source frequency f not right here, you get a huge peak and that is when

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,920
you're stationary, you get a huge peak.

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,590
That is that is mostly due to what is known as clutter, which is basically you're hitting stationary

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:51,530
objects that get sent back and you're picking that up in your Doppler spectrum, your frequency spectrum.

37
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,800
So what you're really, really concerned about is the change from your source frequency because that's

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,880
an object, a target that is moving because it got Doppler shifted, right?

39
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:08,090
So what Terence does do is take a step back and he's like, I've discovered a time relation and all

40
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,500
these cool relativistic effects I can figure this out is his travels.

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:19,070
So what he says is he looks at especially like this is the one he gets, and he says, Well, this is

42
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,200
pretty interesting, right?

43
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:26,600
I don't see any source frequency and I see my target for him, so I know my target, he's moving away.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,920
The thing is, he has to decrease the this spike right here that I'm getting back.

45
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,290
That probably corresponds to my target.

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,330
Right, that makes sense, right?

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,930
We even see that right here are Delta F has to be a negative five five two.

48
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,690
So we see the negative 5.5 to which actually did not right up here, which I'll do that right now.

49
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:51,590
It's negative five thousand five hundred and twenty hertz that he receives back.

50
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,640
So like, what?

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,930
What can I do here?

52
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,920
How can I fix this?

53
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,410
I thought, This is amazing design what's going on here?

54
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:04,790
So if you take a closer look at this diagram, what you will see is that the clutter which used to be,

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,620
if not, has changed.

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,360
Why is this?

57
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,570
We have another peak right here, which I'm going to say for now is the clutter.

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,560
What's going on here?

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,330
Why don't we increase in the frequency?

60
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:21,560
Well, what's going on is that as parents is traveling in the positive X direction with the velocity

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,820
of 20 meters per second, when he shoots off his radar gun, it's going to hit.

62
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,010
Maybe if he's in the desert, it's going to hit a cactus and that cactus is going to send that signal

63
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:31,310
back.

64
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:36,740
But because the cactus are stationary now and he's moving towards it, he's moving towards it.

65
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,770
This sign gets flipped right.

66
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,480
We originally had one minus two v roll over.

67
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,860
See, it becomes one plus.

68
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,460
So now the distance between Terrence, it's Terrence, Real, Terrence and the Cactus.

69
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,930
It's getting smaller as the wave travels back and forth.

70
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,570
So as a result, your frequency has to increase because your wavelength decreases, right?

71
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,900
As the same concept we've been studying in a section so far.

72
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,250
So what happens is clutter now gets a Doppler shift, but it's in the opposite direction than that of

73
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,470
your target, assuming it's moving away from you still.

74
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,740
Right?

75
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,810
So relative to terrorism, it looks like Philip is going in twenty three meters per second.

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:27,200
And that's why if he's really going forty three metres per second, as we determined in the first part

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,040
of this problem, it has to be 23 due to the shift.

78
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,350
And that frequency has to be smaller because relative to him, it's only going 23, right?

79
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,980
In essence, when he travels out, when he's when there's a stationary, the distance is getting.

80
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,680
It's increasing at a higher rate than if he's moving towards him, right?

81
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,470
So is that this is a smaller than the Doppler shift is not as prominent.

82
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,280
We only get, you know, we get a smaller frequency change and we get a smaller, measured velocity.

83
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,380
So this is incorrect.

84
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,050
You describe the other systems, you do not account for the fact that you are moving.

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,800
You would get the wrong result.

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,060
But that still begs the question how can Terrence fix his design and make it converge upon reality?

87
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,630
Well, what you can do is you can take a look at the spectrum and the answer lies in this frequency

88
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,530
plot right here.

89
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:33,050
So what we did in the first portion of this problem is we measured his velocity with respect to somebody

90
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,010
who is stationary.

91
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,560
So what if we did the same exact thing here, even though Terrence is moving?

92
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,960
Well, you're like, Whoa, how do I do that?

93
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,450
That's that sounds a little weird, right?

94
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,020
That's a little.

95
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,400
Let's take a closer look at it.

96
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,930
Well, if we measure the frequency change with respect to the clutter, the cactus, that stationary.

97
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,270
That would give us the speed difference relative to somebody in the stationary reference frame, right?

98
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,510
So what we could do is we could take.

99
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,780
The frequency change from here, this peak to this peak, and that would tell us the relative velocity

100
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,030
of our targets with respect to the cluttered, which is stationary.

101
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,410
Let's try and do that.

102
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,730
Let's see what happens.

103
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,790
So if we take our frequency, so from a stationary object, it would look like the frequency change

104
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,160
would be 400 plus five thousand five hundred twenty and would be a negative change.

105
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,420
So that would be.

106
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,870
Well, what does that come out to be?

107
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:38,090
Oh, that's so nine thousand plus 13 hundredths?

108
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,760
That's ten thousand three hundred.

109
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,310
That's ten thousand three hundred twenty.

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,210
Whoa.

111
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,120
Wait, a second.

112
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,220
Didn't we have that number before?

113
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,090
This might sound familiar.

114
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,910
That's number we had in part a right.

115
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,100
Part A. So what happens?

116
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,450
What happens if we use it?

117
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,350
Let's work through the math.

118
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,180
So we take the same exact equation we have here.

119
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,410
We know this guy with respect to somebody on the on the ground.

120
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,420
Let's say the cactus is right here and be a terrible drawing, but I'll just do it.

121
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,670
As a cactus.

122
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,950
Abortion is hitting this cactus is being sent back.

123
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,420
Another portion is sending that, but we spoke to the cactus.

124
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,990
This guy has to be going 43 three meters per person, so.

125
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,440
We had this guy here, and the point of that was I'm trying to indicate that it's still he still moving

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,360
away from the source, in essence.

127
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,490
This guy's the source now, so plugging in our numbers.

128
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,720
All right, we are the originally from we sent out its 36000 on Hertz.

129
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,200
We're going to subtract these two guys out together.

130
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,480
The forty eight hundred and fifty five twenty.

131
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:48,990
We're going to abide by our original waveform frequency and then just multiply by the Sierra two three

132
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,170
times 10 to the second over two.

133
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,130
Now when we do that, we get to the forty three meters per second back, which is the correct result

134
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,910
for something which is known as a moving radar.

135
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,720
What did you learn?

136
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,870
What did you learn when you learned that you have to be very cognizant about how you're measuring your

137
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,440
velocity?

138
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:16,080
What is it in terms of if you want this in terms of an absolute sort of an absolute value measured by

139
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,220
a stationary object?

140
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,350
You have to do some little tricks with your frequency domain, your frequency spectrum.

141
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,690
And you know this entire science.

142
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,820
I don't know a lot about this, but radar signal processing, that's a huge part of designing a radar

143
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,890
system because, for example, let's let's assess some different situations.

144
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's say we are taking part one of this problem, and we had a cluttered which is centered on our source

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,790
frequency and we get this big large peak.

146
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,940
We get this big large that peak.

147
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:01,540
So our race has been let's say it's like instead of that little thin peak, we get this big, big fat

148
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:01,900
peak.

149
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,860
Maybe it's composed of multiple peaks and we'll see.

150
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,050
That's due to a lot of different maybe certain things are moving.

151
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,460
Other things aren't moving.

152
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,110
We get this big fat peak.

153
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,770
Well, what happens if our Doppler shift?

154
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,920
It's very small.

155
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:27,360
If the target is moving very slowly with respect to us, well, what could happen is the frequency could

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,720
be inside or I'll use a different color here.

157
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,770
These beautiful blue?

158
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,250
It would be inside this peak.

159
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,960
And you would not be able to resolve the frequency out, right?

160
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,610
How would you know where the peak is?

161
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,300
How would you know where that built is if that happened, your radar system?

162
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,250
It would just.

163
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,950
Well, what would it be able to get a result because you would not be able to identify that guy right

164
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,130
there.

165
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,350
So there are a lot of albums you can do that for trying to get rid of your clutter, your background

166
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:06,250
noise and trying to amplify and focus upon the frequency of your target.

167
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:13,630
So radar algorithms can be very complex, very convoluted, and there's a huge big science between that

168
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:17,770
where you know, you look at a lot of things in the frequency domain.

169
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,260
You take Fourier series and you can take a look at some of the signals you send that usually send out

170
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:30,760
a signal where if they post signal like this and you do that, you can derive something called a zinc

171
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:37,090
sync function, which tries to reconcile what this looks like in a frequency domain.

172
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:45,040
So you can find that delta from your source that you send out and try to resolve what the actual frequency

173
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
is of your target to get the velocity.

174
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,450
If that's what you're interested in, in particular for trying to track the target and figuring out

175
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,200
where it's actually located in physical space.

176
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,090
OK, so that's the example problem for this section.

177
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,060
I hope you enjoyed designing your first radar system.

178
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,020
That's pretty cool, right?

179
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,970
I can brag about that to your friends.

180
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,890
You joined Terrance and Phillip in their experiments, and parents in particular with this section is

181
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:22,000
very happy that he redesigned his reader system because now that smirk again, he can give Philip a

182
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,640
ticket and get revenge on him doing all these wacky, insane experiments.

183
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:26,980
OK?

184
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,390
So I hope you enjoyed that.

185
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:35,920
Next, we're going to jump into mechanics, look at some really intriguing ideas such as relativistic

186
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,420
momentum, relativistic energy, and you're probably going to encounter some of the most famous IDF

187
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,750
in special relativity.

188
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,770
I hope you're excited.

189
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,870
I'm excited to teach you, but the first thing you need to do is run through some problems of your own

190
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,150
so you can become a master Jedi.

191
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,740
All these ideas and you know it's your exam ace your designs in real life as an engineer, so on and

192
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,340
so forth.

193
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,510
Stay tuned.
