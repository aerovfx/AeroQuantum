1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,490
All right.

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,890
To wrap this video up on the relativistic Doppler shift, what we're going to do is we're going to calculate

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:30,760
the two way Doppler shift because we know from our previous discussions that the the equation for the

4
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:36,400
frequency at the target is not exactly what the radar is going to see return back to it.

5
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:42,220
We know that we have to fly to Doppler shifts, and we only calculated that with a non relativistic

6
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,640
value.

7
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,580
Let's do the same thing here for the relativistic value.

8
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:46,900
So to do that?

9
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:54,010
To try and calculate the frequency that is received by Terence and his radar station, and I put a little

10
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,120
relative sign here to indicate that we're using relativistic quantities.

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,180
We know that that is going to equal basically our Doppler shift equation, the one minus variable over

12
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,880
C square root of that divided by the square root of one plus b relevancy times the frequency at the

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,740
target that Philip sees.

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,780
And again, that's the relative term.

15
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,190
And we know that what we just arrived is that the frequency of the target is basically the same huge

16
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,150
radical term right here times the frequency in the source that parents emits up.

17
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,130
So to make progress on this, we're going to do the same exact thing we did previously.

18
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,230
We're going to take this guy right here, which I will box in for you.

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,030
And we're going to literally throw it right there.

20
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,800
We're going to plug it straight into this guy.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,880
So when we do that, we retain this guy here and basically we get the same exact quantity multiplied

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,430
out.

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,000
So we got a lot of radical sides.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,940
The little it's not super nice, but I'll show you it's not going to be too bad.

25
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,840
And then we multiply by the frequency of the source, which is right here.

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,820
We have the fine.

27
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:06,000
So if we're going to take the terms on the square roots and multiply it together and ban the square,

28
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,960
it's drop out and we get this equation here for the two way Doppler shift.

29
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:17,470
OK, so what this is is the receive frequency is equal to one minus V relative of a C divided by the

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,920
quantity one plus v relative or mercy times the source frequency that is the minute by Terence in his

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,550
radio station.

32
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,780
So when you see something like this compared to our previous term, which was, I mean, it was like

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,640
one minus two times the relative velocity or C times the source frequency.

34
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,600
It's not quite as nice as a lot more terms.

35
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:43,070
It would take a lot more effort to do that computation program it up, so on and so forth.

36
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,330
So what I want to do is I want to try and compare this to that previous result.

37
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,730
And the way in which we do that is we take this guy here.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,040
We try and get rid of this fractional term, right?

39
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,620
Because fractional term makes it really hard to deal with.

40
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,580
How do we do that?

41
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,050
How do we get rid of this guy?

42
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,880
We want to take an expense.

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,070
You want to expand this out and see how it's expressed in terms of polynomials.

44
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,960
We do that by a serious binomial expansion, so on and so forth.

45
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,910
Luckily, we saw previously in this section when we're dealing with the Doppler shift that we could

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,990
take an expansion.

47
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,180
We can recall the expansion from earlier.

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:30,160
So pilots that one over one plus x is the following it's one minus x plus x squared minus excuse, so

49
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,790
on and so forth.

50
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,990
You can see the pattern that is arising straight out of this.

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,210
So if we take that, we can apply to both these terms and we'll have to do it separately because it's

52
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:46,210
much more convoluted and you can see why working with the relativistic opposite might be a little bit

53
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:46,900
of a pain.

54
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,400
It's not as elegant.

55
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,810
It's not as nice as the other one.

56
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:56,470
So what we could do is we could split up one over one plus B relevancy as one terminal can have a not

57
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,580
another term, which is minus Berala to C developed by one plus B or C.

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,610
And we're going to set our X term here.

59
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:08,800
We're going to set this guy equal to row over C.

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,000
OK, so we're going to do that in two steps and then we're going to add them together.

61
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,370
OK.

62
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,910
So the first third, which is one over one plus the C, when we do that, all we need to do is just

63
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,580
plug this guy into that guy.

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,040
So the X becomes a V rollover c.

65
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:32,890
So we have one minus B relevancy plus v relevancy squared minus BRL over C cubed as models, plus an

66
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,420
infinite number of polynomials.

67
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,510
And we can drop this off when it starts to approach zero as the relevancy ratio.

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,930
But we know that we're going to have relativistic double shifts.

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,460
We'll probably traveling close to the speed of light, so we're going to go out, have to go up very

70
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,200
far before we find negligible terms.

71
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:57,850
So it might not be as feasible to expand this out and use the expanded term, but I'm doing this to

72
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,130
show you something pretty cool.

73
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,830
Stick with me.

74
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:07,540
So next we got the one term we want to take care of the minus B relative or C divided by the denominator.

75
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,150
So in order to do that, we have to do that in two states, it's not as nice.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,330
So first, what we're going to do is we could take basically this term here, this guy right here and

77
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,320
throw it down into the brackets.

78
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,090
So this is basically.

79
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,160
This entire term here.

80
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,490
We throw down into the brackets and we just have to multiply by negative zero.

81
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:39,030
So when we do that and we multiply everything through, what we end up with is a negative relative ever

82
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,080
seen plus zero or c squared.

83
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,580
Minus bureaucracy.

84
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,320
Cute.

85
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:58,360
Plus, the relevancy, so forth, so on and so forth, so we could take this result and add it to this

86
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,350
result right here.

87
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,110
When we do that, we basically recover back this guy right here, which is that guy right there.

88
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,360
So when we do that, we see we got a one, a one right there.

89
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:21,490
Minus a B relevancy plus of euro, plus a negative vitriol, see, so again, that's one minus five

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,250
euros the minus the euro or C, so that gives us a one minus two B rollover C.

91
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,040
And then we go back up, we see we have a very c squared.

92
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:39,190
Well, we have that also in gesture here, so we get two times that and a minus.

93
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,780
We're so cute.

94
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:41,860
We have that.

95
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,420
Also over here is a minus two.

96
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,940
And basically what happens is we just get two times the power using the same kind of pattern.

97
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,820
You can see the pattern that's arising from that expansion.

98
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,180
OK.

99
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:59,020
So when we get this result in corporates who are not relativistic scenario, we find something interesting.

100
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:08,140
So I got the result down here that this this guy goes all the way up over here and our frequency, our

101
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,080
C frequency and relativistic sense.

102
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,050
If we expand it out, it's going to be one minus two times virality of over 30 plus two times B relative

103
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,480
or C squared, minus two times the rest of our C cute.

104
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,930
We have to keep on going until these terms can really dampen out that they don't contribute anything

105
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,290
additional depending upon the precision we're looking for.

106
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,960
And then we multiply by our source frequency.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,130
So if we take this.

108
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:41,680
And compare it to our non relativistic result when we expanded it out.

109
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:51,780
What we had was one minus two times virale over C, but we sort of locked in as this turns the source

110
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,380
frequency.

111
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:58,710
But initially in the expansion we saw, we had a plus viral load of C squared and we could continue

112
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,760
expanding it out now.

113
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:08,490
We decided to drop this term here because a small ratio when the relative velocity is much less than

114
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,830
C a small ratio squared, it's much smaller than the ratio itself, right?

115
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,960
So it's insignificant.

116
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:22,260
But what's really cool is that we see these initial terms line up with a relativistic result and then

117
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,000
we get a V relative of a C squared term popping out.

118
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,920
But it's missing this, too.

119
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,620
And if we continued, we would get similar results that are popping out.

120
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,470
So we see that.

121
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,350
The moral to the stick result.

122
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,590
It's sort of like the relativistic result.

123
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,410
And as the speeds start to slow down, this will converge upon this.

124
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,790
That's what we would find.

125
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:56,250
But in situations such as the USS Enterprise, the Millennium Falcon, a lot of fictional ideas so far

126
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:56,970
so far.

127
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,240
We would want to use this relativistic result, and we've got it right here.

128
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,730
So whatever you're doing this, you want really precise results.

129
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:13,020
You can use this guy, you know this guy right here and this for radar systems when you want to the

130
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,190
two way Doppler shift.

131
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,760
You can tell, you know, it's not as nice to work with, but it would get you that nice, precise result

132
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:29,420
for manmade vehicles, we found that beta is much smaller than one or the velocity is much lower than

133
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,170
the speed of light.

134
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,310
And we could get away actually with using this nice, simplified equation if we want a more precision.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,270
Right.

136
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:47,380
Instead of taking one minus two times B rather c, we can add in the square turn and hold just a bit

137
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,800
closer to the relative term here.

138
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,280
OK.

139
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,230
So there you have it.

140
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,040
The moral to the relativistic result is more convenient, easier to work with, but this guy's going

141
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,460
to converge upon reality and this is what we want if we really want to bridge the gap between an infinite

142
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,910
set of perceptions of the universe.

143
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,480
OK, so whatever you do, any problem like this pay attention to your relative velocity and let this

144
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,430
guide your logic in choosing what equation you want.

145
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,320
I hope you enjoy the video.

146
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,330
Stay tuned for the next section.

147
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,630
When we start jumping into more wacky ideas, crazy effects related to momentum, energy and maybe other

148
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,680
interesting ideas.

149
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,630
I'm not going to ruin it for you right now.

150
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,440
Stay tuned.
