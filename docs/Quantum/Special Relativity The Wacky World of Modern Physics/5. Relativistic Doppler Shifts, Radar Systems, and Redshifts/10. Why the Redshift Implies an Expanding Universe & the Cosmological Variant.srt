1
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:24,520
So back in the day, the early 1980s, we were doing kind of calculations and measurements like this,

2
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:32,050
and a lot of astronomers were looking at the light that comes back from different case hours, galaxies

3
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:32,710
and nebulae.

4
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:41,850
One particular astronomer, VMC lifer at the local observatory in 1912, what he did is he measured

5
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,790
these Doppler shifts and he made a very stark conclusion.

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,320
He concluded that surrounding nebula and a nebula is that could be a galaxy of basically any kind of

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,740
dust arrangement that is being held together by gravity.

8
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:03,720
But he concluded, the surrounding nebula to our Milky Way galaxy are receding away from us at high

9
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,770
velocities.

10
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,120
OK, so that was a very important note that was thought to suggest that perhaps the universe is woohp

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,520
expanding, continually expanding, which would support what it would support the Big Bang Theory and

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,220
sort of disprove another notion that was around during the day that perhaps the universe is the steady

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,140
stays stagnant kind of entity, which we know to be false to this day.

14
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,120
So that was his contribution.

15
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:36,210
That's why this was superimposed the redshift classically and from a historical context, because this

16
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,070
individual cipher, you know, we were making these measurements and we could deduce that the universe

17
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,880
is expanding.

18
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,380
But he didn't have really the full picture.

19
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,370
So Edwin Hubble, after he saw some some of these conclusions coming from Cypher, he worked quite diligently

20
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,970
for about 20 or so years with another individual.

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,100
And by 1935, what he was doing is he was compiling the velocities and distances of hundreds of galaxies,

22
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,660
a form of a nebula to deduce that the universe is.

23
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,450
It's expanding, it's expanding what's really supported.

24
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:17,910
The notion of the Big Bang Theory is what he did is he made these nice, precise measurements, which

25
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,000
are very difficult to make, and he took that information.

26
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:27,300
He measured the distance, the approximate distance that these galaxies were located from us, and he

27
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,130
plotted up their recessional velocity calculated using this guy right here.

28
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,520
It's pretty easy to calculate here because you measure these, this, this redshift and multiply by

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,330
C. You can get the relative velocity pretty easily.

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,720
This one is a bit more complicated.

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,160
Again, we're increasing the complexity so you get more accuracy.

32
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,300
But he plotted all these guys and we feel that we can regretfully fit a lie to this, right?

33
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,220
We just need a straight line.

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:04,570
And what he came up with next using all this information was a quite an amazing conclusion.

35
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,350
You can have what is known as Hubble's law that the universe is expanding and at different distances.

36
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,650
The last year, which it expands, is different and I've lost.

37
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,510
He was described using this chart as false.

38
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:28,240
He said the velocity of expansion of the universe at any distance are away from the Earth is described

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,490
linearly using this constant h.

40
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:39,190
And as it became known as the Hubble parameter, it's important to note that it is not static, it's

41
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,120
always changing.

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,820
And that's because at different areas in the universe, in an isotropic.

43
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,360
Spacetime kind of kind of picture.

44
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,450
We know that the universe is expanding and expanding and expanding at different rates.

45
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,890
And the way you want to think about the universe is twofold.

46
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:07,060
You can think about the universe in different galaxies located on the spacetime as there are two analogies

47
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,960
one you can think of it as.

48
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,140
A balloon that's expanding and you have little dots on the outside of the balloon.

49
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,760
And we know that even though the Earth is not at the center of the blue, it does not have to be at

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,750
the center of the universe.

51
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,850
This is not conclude that we're at the center of the universe, that the dots as you blow up the balloon,

52
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,490
they're going to move away from each other on the surface of that balloon of that curvature.

53
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,790
So we're going to get some recessional and some there might be some dots actually move close to us.

54
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:45,500
And these lifer and Hubble actually did observe that maybe one or two galaxies were being blue shifted,

55
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,460
if you will.

56
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:54,980
But in general, the universe is expanding at a different rate, at different areas along along that

57
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,370
balloon, so that supports this sort of idea here.

58
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,850
Another way to look at it is sort of like raisins in bread.

59
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,710
So when you put raisins and bread and you bake it and the bread starts to expand, the raisins gradually

60
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,910
move away from each other.

61
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:18,770
But they've lost the air, which they're expanding is contingent upon the radial distance from the center,

62
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:20,390
for example, or from each other.

63
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,780
So the further away you get your velocity, your obsessional velocity tends to increase linearly.

64
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,380
OK.

65
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,100
And.

66
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,750
This each term is going to change based upon heredity, the universe's characteristics are going to

67
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,510
change and evolve over time.

68
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,460
So this snapshot that Hubble generated back in what?

69
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,280
Oh, 1935, it's going to be different.

70
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,920
It's going to be different, slightly different than the snapshot we would generate now because the

71
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,780
universe is expanding at a different rate.

72
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,170
Right.

73
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,920
Time has evolved how the universe behaves.

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,260
So what we also have is we can take this sort of beyond the scope of this course.

75
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,580
I'll go over it briefly.

76
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,270
And what I want you to understand after I talk about this conceptually is the cosmological redshift,

77
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,990
which I'll get to that.

78
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:13,380
But.

79
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,010
An individual named Friedman, he solved the Friedman equation, which should have been a solution to

80
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:28,030
Einstein's field equations and general relativity, which helped to give a sense of the form of spacetime

81
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,870
or different metrics that are being observed in our universe.

82
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,490
And in doing so, we were able to see that this parameter is going to change.

83
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,230
It's going to evolve with time based upon a skill factor of that metric space.

84
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,110
One over a is the scale factor.

85
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,780
But the Hubble parameter changes as one of her a times DADT.

86
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,020
OK, so the details about this are very complex, very convoluted.

87
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,660
It's a bit beyond the scope of this course.

88
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:04,090
If you want to look up the freedman equation, and I think it's far RTW metrics based on Google Wikipedia.

89
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,930
If you feel like you have enough mathematical background for that.

90
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:14,260
But what I want you to understand is that the universe is expanding and at the velocity at which it

91
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,220
expands.

92
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,600
Is different words, a function of the radial distance you are?

93
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,780
From other objects, OK.

94
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,470
So.

95
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,420
As you can see, the relativistic Doppler shift can be used a lot in cosmology can be used a lot in

96
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,140
astrophysics.

97
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:41,520
And it really helped us deduce from this redshift that the universe is indeed expanding.

98
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,290
And when we combine that with other information such as there's sort of like a background radiation

99
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:54,720
that we always observe, which is sort of from the beginning of the the birth of the universe.

100
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,060
All this really supported the Big Bang Theory because the Big Bang Theory states that we had this most

101
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:08,640
condense or rather dense ball of matter that exploded and we are continually expanding as a result of

102
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:08,880
that.

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,180
This supports that theory, supports that theory.

104
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:20,760
OK, so the last thing I want to talk about in this particular video is the notion of the cosmological

105
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,120
redshift.

106
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:29,040
Now what we talked about here is literally a change in wavelength of frequency, which is really driven

107
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,030
by the recessional or approach velocity of different objects.

108
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:40,560
But based upon this information here, we found that the universe is expanding.

109
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,790
Space is expanding.

110
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,670
So this gives rise to another type of redshift that is sometimes confused.

111
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:56,390
With a Doppler based red shift, and this is called a cosmological redshift, because what it's saying

112
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:02,390
is that if you have two galaxies and light is traveling from, let's say, this galaxy here to this

113
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,380
galaxy there know that's a big distance that's like millions of light years.

114
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,820
It's a very large distance.

115
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,510
So as it's traveling, the universe is expanding.

116
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,130
So as the light from the sky is coming over here, these guys are moving apart.

117
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:21,230
Spacetime is moving, which means that the wavelength gets longer.

118
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,930
It gets red, shifted right.

119
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:31,670
So we do get a redshift as a result of the fact that the universe is expanding and that expansion increase

120
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,500
the distance that light has to travel.

121
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,560
That's going to change a frequency, right?

122
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,080
That's what we learn.

123
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,630
That's the basic concept of Doppler shift.

124
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,080
OK.

125
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,820
So as a result of this, sometimes there's a cosmological redshift.

126
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,920
It's not going to really do off in this course, but just for reference, our redshift parameters seeing

127
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,870
as a different form.

128
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,110
We find that one plus is equal to it.

129
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,190
It's it's equal to the scaling factor at different periods of time.

130
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:04,610
So the scaling factor now compared to at a different time in the past, that's going to give our redshift.

131
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,510
And that sort of makes sense because if you're expanding at a different rate now than when you were

132
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:15,650
previously right, that's going to change the distance between the two different objects.

133
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,360
And that sort of gives rise to this cosmological redshift, which is indeed different than a Doppler

134
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,710
based redshift.

135
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:31,430
The only thing I want to make note of is that this phenomenon is so interesting because it gives rise

136
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,890
to situations in which it looks like objects are traveling faster than the speed of light.

137
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,410
Whoa.

138
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,240
Wait a second.

139
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,370
I hope you're thinking, Hey buddy, you told me that we can't travel faster than the speed of light.

140
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,360
Are we got that from our time dilation equation that crops up many times in this course?

141
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,740
What's going on here?

142
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,490
What I'm trying to insinuate here is that.

143
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,190
If the distance between here is expanding.

144
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,970
It may appear as though this object is moving super fast, faster than the speed of light because of

145
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,730
its expansion.

146
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,430
But in actuality, it's an illusion, right?

147
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,450
If you would open your eyes and take a deeper look at the situation, what you find is that as we studied

148
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,150
in the first video in a section right, we're just expanding the distance that the the light has to

149
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,070
travel over, so we expand on and off.

150
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,870
It may appear, or it may seem like.

151
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,690
You're traveling at the speed of light.

152
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,410
But in essence, what is happening is you're just expanding so much while you travel like millions of

153
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,780
light years that it may appear as though this galaxy is moving away from us faster than the speed of

154
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,110
light.

155
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,260
But indeed, it is not.

156
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,870
It's just.

157
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,420
It's just an artifact that's the proper word of the expansion of the universe, so there you have it.

158
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,980
That's the red shift.

159
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,750
That's how it was used in astrophysics and cosmology to show that the universe is expanding.

160
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:08,980
And it shows us that, yes, indeed, the relativistic Doppler shift does provide valuable information

161
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,940
that can allow us to make some stark conclusions regarding the evolution of the universe.

162
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,320
I hope you enjoyed that.

163
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,900
Next, we're going to run through an example, and then I'm going to be some practice problems to work

164
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,880
through so you can become a master of both the Doppler shift and the redshift.

165
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,170
Stay tuned.
