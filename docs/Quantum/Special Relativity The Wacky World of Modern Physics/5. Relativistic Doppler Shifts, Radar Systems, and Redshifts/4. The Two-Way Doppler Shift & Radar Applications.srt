1
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,110
All right, Rob.

2
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,570
More discussion on the derivation of opposites.

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,110
What I want to do is go over one last derivation of the equation to do this.

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,390
What we're going to do is we're going to make no use of any prior results that we have derived and it's

5
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,670
going to be 100 percent organic.

6
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,830
We're just going to run through the math, the physics and the representations we have for waves, and

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:44,180
we're going to find out the same exact real result actually drops out of what we're working on.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,660
And that's going to strengthen our confidence and make us feel very, very confident that the bridge

9
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,350
we built to sort of bridge the gap between different perspectives and reference frames is bad, is good

10
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,120
and is the correct way of interpreting frequency shifts with these different observers.

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,970
So to do this, what we're going to do is we're going to make use of what we just talked about with

12
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,740
ENM waves with a propagating wave to the right, and we're going to have some kind of target a plane

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,080
that's fly to the right with a velocity V.

14
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,920
What we know is that the distance to that plane is going to change with time from the source of the

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,750
wave all the way to the the actual object, the type we're trying to detect.

16
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:33,620
And that's going to have a distance of X as a function of T. So what we do is we take the equation for

17
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,400
a propagating wave traveling in the positive x direction.

18
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,450
Write that down.

19
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,940
We found in the last video that was the function, which is the function of X A. is equivalent to the

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:52,670
amplitude a times the cosine and the angle is omega t minus K, where again omega is the angular frequency

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,950
and K is the propagation number or wave number that we talked about previously.

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,880
So using this, the first thing we want to do is put in our definitions we have for again, the propagation

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,770
constant and the angular frequency.

24
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:14,120
We take omega and plug in to pi f not we know that omega naught, which is this guy right here.

25
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,080
This is equal to two by f Nazi.

26
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,430
We plug that guy in there.

27
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,450
Basically plop that straight in and for the wave number of propagation constant, we know that is equivalent

28
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:32,270
to two pi over land and off the original wavelength that is observed transmitted from the radar system.

29
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:40,400
Next, what we want to do is we want to get rid of this wavelength here and inject the frequency.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,110
What we're really interested in.

31
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,500
So as we've seen previously, we've done this in the previous video.

32
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,390
We've done it in our original derivation.

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,500
We know that the frequency is related to lambda by C over lambda.

34
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,660
This is the equation we have derived.

35
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,320
OK.

36
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,350
Again, I always bring up the units we take me to for second, divided by mean meters, we get one over

37
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,610
second, one over time.

38
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,950
Those are the dimensions of frequency, so it seems to make sense and jive well with our intuition.

39
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,560
OK, now what we want to do is we want to take this and move the ladder over here and the frequency

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,770
down so that we can plug it straight into here what we're going to use.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,460
If we take this, we find that ladder, not the original wavelength, is equivalent to the C, the speed

42
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,030
of light divided by F, not the original frequency.

43
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,590
So we pop this guy in C gets on the bottom, f not pop up.

44
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,000
And what we find is that we have common terms in here.

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,080
We have an f, not that we're trying to get with an X and we have the speed of light.

46
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:49,220
OK, but we know that the Doppler shift is in terms of relative motion between the source and the observer,

47
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,720
the target that we're trying to detect.

48
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:58,400
So when the world, what's going on here in order to make progress, we must first make note that inside

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,070
here, this is the angular argument, OK?

50
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,980
So here if we group the two pi f not.

51
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,910
We end up with a T minus X over C or something like this, we know this is the angle that described

52
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,170
any position on this way as it propagates in time.

53
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:23,240
Next, what we want to do is we need to make note of a relationship that we derived or whether we didn't

54
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,530
derive is just physical intuition that crops up in classical mechanics.

55
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,290
And this is the fact that the angular frequency omega.

56
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:41,390
If if we take the Omega that is observed by the target, this guy is equal to two pi times f prime,

57
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,020
but it's also equal to the change in that angle, right?

58
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:50,840
This is the angular frequency, it's how it's changing d theta d t, it's that derivative, right?

59
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,770
We've made use quite extensive use of this in basic mechanics.

60
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,200
It crops up in dynamics, so on and so forth.

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,910
This is a intuitive physical quantity right here.

62
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:09,440
So if we take this this result here and we're trying to figure out how the frequency where the angular

63
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,800
frequency observed at the target is different than the original produced frequency of the wave.

64
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,470
What we can do is we can isolate FPI by divide it by one or two pi of heredity, and we get this relationship

65
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,010
right here.

66
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:30,310
Well, we know what the angular quantity is because we just tried to previously right here.

67
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,450
And all we need to do is basically just take the derivative of this guy.

68
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:41,080
So we plop it straight in, straight and down here, throw it into that derivative and we distribute

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,980
this through all turns.

70
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,970
We know that two PI, if not the original frequency, is a constant.

71
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,750
It's not changing.

72
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,700
That pops out right here.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,840
We can divide by the two pi right there that cancels, and then we just have to distribute this through

74
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,350
these terms.

75
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,640
The T minus x the receipt.

76
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,060
Well, the trade with respect to time of time is just one, which is what we get here.

77
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:09,960
And the derivative of a C is a little tricky to actually compute that.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,330
We know that C is the speed of light that's constant that pops out.

79
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,440
But the X here, the X, we must remember, is the position going to our target?

80
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,020
So this is a function of time.

81
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,740
But the derivative, this becomes the velocity.

82
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,280
It's the distance between here and and the target.

83
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,880
So you know, that is increasing by a a quantity of the relative motion.

84
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,820
And that's where the relative motion between our source and our observer comes into play.

85
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,340
This is how it jumps into the equation.

86
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:45,730
OK.

87
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,740
So the duration of this is one third of X, it's just B.

88
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:56,860
And when we put that into play here, we end up with the same exact equation that the angular frequency

89
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,780
f prime is equal to one minus V or c f not.

90
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,560
OK.

91
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,120
So this is going to be when the source.

92
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,520
The source.

93
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,070
An observer.

94
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,660
Are moving.

95
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,970
Away from each other.

96
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:32,360
And then we could take this guy and say that f prime is equal to one plus the oversea.

97
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,850
If not for.

98
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,680
Moving closer.

99
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,060
So.

100
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:51,610
The sign of the paucity of that relative motion dictates the arrival of that different phenomena, the

101
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,380
Doppler shift that we've been talking about, and I want to make note about these two differences here.

102
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,400
Because when you're if you're doing any kind of problem that you're working on.

103
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,310
If they're coming together, you want to use this guy, right?

104
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,710
Because the frequency is going to increase.

105
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,600
Right, it's moving into the wave train, so it's seeing that crest more frequently.

106
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,390
And then if they're moving away from each other, you use this guy where the frequency decreases because

107
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,970
you're moving away from that wave that's coming towards it.

108
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,490
So the wave has to move over a longer distance.

109
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,280
You see that wave less frequently.

110
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,540
It leads to a smaller Doppler shift, OK?

111
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,660
Or rather, the frequency is lower.

112
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,210
OK, now what?

113
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,370
We have just arrived throughout this video in the previous videos is the fact that.

114
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:53,170
If we're trying to detect a target with radar in this particular application, what this guy sees is

115
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:53,620
this.

116
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,830
But when you're dealing with radar, what you're trying to do is you're trying to emit a light, some

117
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,030
kind of wave, some kind of beam, you're trying to hit a target.

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,430
And then that gets reflected back.

119
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,920
To your source towards your dish.

120
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:10,630
Right?

121
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,200
So this is only half of the picture, right?

122
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,230
It doesn't help to know the frequency here.

123
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,020
We want to know the return frequency here.

124
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,990
So the way in which we think about this is if this guy is moving in this direction, right?

125
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:34,690
You increase the distance between the wave and the object that decreases the frequency as we have just

126
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,140
arrived.

127
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:42,640
However, when it hits this, it's going to bounce off and come back and the time difference between

128
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,620
when it hits this.

129
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:52,220
And it moves and then another one hits it means that you have to add on that extra vote, that extra

130
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,790
distance.

131
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:59,000
So there's a Doppler shift that this observes and then there's a Doppler shift from this frequency.

132
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,950
So this guy black that we have there, so there's a double Doppler shift.

133
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,610
I want to make sure you understand that.

134
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,680
Do you understand that?

135
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,340
So initially, this guy sees something different because it's moving away, it's adding in distance.

136
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,530
But this guy wanted to reflect it back.

137
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,800
This becomes the source and the source is moving away.

138
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,570
So this guy observes, you get extra distance that keeps adding up incrementally.

139
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,030
And that means that you see that same beam less frequently back here, right?

140
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,250
It bounces off.

141
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,250
There's a time delay.

142
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,280
So we're going to have to have another Doppler shift.

143
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,220
What this guy sees is not this.

144
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,810
It's not that.

145
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,900
So let's do it.

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,870
OK, well, this tells us that I'm going to rewrite this.

147
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,180
This is the source frequency right here.

148
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,740
I'll put a little se here.

149
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,630
And this is the target.

150
00:10:54,310 --> 00:11:00,060
Hours, yeah, so the target sees this Doppler shift at frequency.

151
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,860
But now what we want is the frequency at the receiver, so the frequency.

152
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,240
At the receiver, it's going to be the same exact idea, right?

153
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,900
Based upon this, looks like this guy's moving away, so we're increasing that distance again.

154
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,840
It gets Doppler shift, we get another decrease.

155
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:29,230
So what actually ends up happening is if the same exact formula we get one minus v over C, well, this

156
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,000
time it's on the target.

157
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,160
See, this is the produced frequency.

158
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,960
And we want to see how that's shifted back to the receiver.

159
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,700
So what you end up having is you get this one minus B or C.

160
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,980
And then we just put this guy in, we know what the target is.

161
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,860
So that's another one minus B or C.

162
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,160
Times the source frequency.

163
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,340
Which is something you know, right, right, when you admit that frequency in your signal processor,

164
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,180
you know what's being generated, you know what you're modulating and what you're sending out.

165
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,320
So that's what we know.

166
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:06,830
OK.

167
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,840
So if we take this and work through the math we end up with is one minus two B or C.

168
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,170
Plus B squared.

169
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,600
Overseas Square.

170
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,140
OK.

171
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,300
And I hope you're thinking when you see this, there's some of the stuff we would have previously.

172
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,320
If B or C is small as it is in a non role, it is the case.

173
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,070
If you square a small turn, it gets even smaller, so this relative to this, which is multiplying

174
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,380
by two, is drastically smaller.

175
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,210
So when you open up a radar textbook, what you're going to find is that this is going to be reduced.

176
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,000
You're going to get something that looks sort of like this.

177
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,760
You're going to get there are seat frequency.

178
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:04,710
Is equal to one minus two the oversea.

179
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,500
Times that guy.

180
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,400
OK, so that would be what the dish.

181
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:19,610
The Signal processor actually observes when the signal is actually received back at the dish.

182
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,000
OK.

183
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:27,080
And another way of actually dividing this is you might see sometimes people say there's like a two way

184
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,770
Doppler shift.

185
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,970
In my opinion, it's not quite right because it doesn't capture what's going on.

186
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:40,130
They would change X to two x here becomes two x oversee the distance actually traveled because it has

187
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:42,530
to go out and then come back.

188
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,120
Well, that's not.

189
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,090
That's not 100 percent kosher, if not now, because you have multiple phenomena occurring here.

190
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,500
And if you did that, you get this result, but this term would fall out.

191
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,260
We get a sort of similar term if we work on it and do it in a relativistic sense, which you'll see

192
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,570
in subsequent videos, but.

193
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:08,990
What's important to note here in the application is if you know your source frequency which you send

194
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,010
out, you're going to know that because you generate the beam that's actually sent out to your target

195
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,620
and you measure what comes back.

196
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,840
If you relate to as such, you can determine the velocity of your target.

197
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:27,270
And I can give you a lot of information now in terms of the signal processing of this.

198
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
It's a lot of weird stuff that's going on.

199
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,470
Usually you have sort of a post signal.

200
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,160
Something like this where you send out a beam.

201
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,570
You energize your your dish and then you wait to receive, you energize.

202
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:49,860
Waiter Steve Um, it's known as like a peeler up pri pulse repetition interval.

203
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,110
Um, something like this when you actually process it.

204
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,030
The resolution you get is dependent upon, you know, how long you sent our signal, how long you wait

205
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,450
for it.

206
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:07,680
And that can affect the Fourier transform you receive back, which might not be able to to show this

207
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,270
shift, the Doppler shift.

208
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,950
So there's a lot of interesting things that go into play with radar systems.

209
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,980
That's just a general idea of what's going on, but for the most part, your Doppler shift.

210
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:29,010
It's showing you when something is moving, one and two allows you to compute the velocity of that guy.

211
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,750
So this can tell us, Hey, you have a nuke that's coming in super, super frickin fast.

212
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,660
Freak out, do something or you can see that it's some target that's remaining still, which would be

213
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,760
like a mountain, for example, something where you don't want to engage a target that's coming in to

214
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,560
take it down before it blows up your town.

215
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,350
OK, so you get that information from it.

216
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,840
What I want to do is to wrap this up.

217
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,390
Just talk about some other applications of this.

218
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,210
Doppler shift is not off the relativistic Doppler shift.

219
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,780
I talked about the ambulance, what you hear on an everyday basis.

220
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:08,100
Another application is the radar gun that policemen generally use, like in their car shoot out a beam.

221
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,740
And when it comes back, that can allow them to determine the velocity that you are traveling right

222
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,200
because it's going to hit your car instead of a plane, a car, and it's going to come back and it could

223
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,250
use something like this.

224
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,940
It probably would use the relativistic quantity because that's more accurate.

225
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,170
But if you're going slow, it could technically use this guy right here.

226
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,580
And that gives you a quantity.

227
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,360
You're right.

228
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,920
You can measure the receive frequency versus frequency, and you could figure out how fast somebody

229
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,840
is going, I can tell.

230
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,850
Are they traveling within the speed limits of the law?

231
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,660
You can pull them over and, you know, get tickets for that reason.

232
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,870
So when you get tickets, yes, this is pretty accurate.

233
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,410
That gun.

234
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,310
Another application you've probably heard of is Doppler radar, which is used a lot in meteorology and

235
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,120
weather systems.

236
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,590
The way in which that works is you have like a big dome that's sending out signals, light waves.

237
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:08,700
It's going to hit a cloud and then it's going to come back, one that signifies the presence of storms,

238
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:13,770
but also based upon the frequency that you receive back.

239
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:19,050
That's going to tell you whether there's a storm moving in or whether it's receding and moving away

240
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,010
from your location.

241
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:27,540
So when you see, like on TV, you see Doppler maps where you have like green areas for precipitation

242
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,550
that signifies the velocity.

243
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:36,030
When you get a tornado, for example, when it's rotating around, you have a portion that's moving

244
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,810
to you and a portion on the other side that's moving away from you.

245
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,990
So if you start getting a very green color over here in a red color over there that signifies the rotation

246
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:52,410
of particles, debris or any kind of wind, so on and so forth, and that allows you to determine that,

247
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,130
hey, you know, we have some kind of circular cyclone kind of thing.

248
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,200
Perhaps there is severe weather or some kind of tornado that comes that comes in.

249
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,740
So that's sort of how Doppler is used in a weather sense.

250
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,280
But that's that that's the Doppler shift, the non relativistic term.

251
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:18,820
What I want you to pay attention to when you use this is whether the target is coming in together or

252
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,600
the target is moving, moving away from the source.

253
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,280
Depending upon that, you use one of these equations that controls the sign.

254
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,340
Um, but yes, the Doppler frequency.

255
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,840
I hope you enjoy that after we run through some practice problems.

256
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,460
Next, what we're going to do is we're going to jump into the relativistic Doppler shift.

257
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,310
We're going to modify this a bit by using some of the information we have learned, such as the Lorenz

258
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:49,410
transformation, time dilation, length contraction, so on and so forth.

259
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,420
So they can.
