1
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.660
All right, so if you felt like that was to conceptualize were there is too much hand-waving going on

2
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.860
now we're going to read arrive the same exact result by food back you put up within the derivation of

3
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.960
this equation and showing how the result we just arrived early pops straight out from mathematical principles.

4
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.780
If you run through back from the back preceding part of this starvation, so what we found?

5
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.420
We derive this guy is, we said all we need to do is we need to take a look at in waves, right?

6
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.240
If we do that, the results should just fall right out.

7
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.840
So we said, Terence, when he's emitting some kind of being some kind of radar signal, what he says

8
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.440
is that he's seen as little waves or cosine.

9
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.240
In this case, the real component is defined as an amplitude A and the cosine of omega T minus K X were

10
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.660
measured.

11
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.530
Your angular frequency and K is your wave number.

12
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.450
So using this, we know that the result is measured in the radar system and in order to get the correct

13
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.710
result when he jump to relativity, what did I suggest?

14
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.410
I suggest that you must be very cognizant and stay in tune with what reference frame.

15
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.150
Each measurement is made within an account for each one consistently.

16
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.560
So we're going to be very careful about where this electromagnetic wave is being measured and what the

17
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.790
X component and the key component, how that's actually measured.

18
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.280
So we know that initially when this was shot off Tarrant's, it's going to measure some kind of wave

19
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.090
in his wave generator, his pulse pulse train.

20
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.160
And we ended up with the falling relationship here where we had the Cosine two PI final times T minus

21
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.990
two pi, f not x oversee, right?

22
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.040
We had that relationship between our weight number and our angular frequency omega.

23
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.320
And then when we had this, what we did is we said we could take this angular point and all we need

24
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.360
to do is just take the derivative right.

25
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.700
We stated that if the target wants to predict its frequency after our prime, all he needs to do is

26
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.320
fill up.

27
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.520
He just says I take one or two pi and multiply it by the derivative D Theta D T.

28
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.420
But the important thing here is to say or rather to question.

29
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.720
What is the time and how is that measured and how is this angle measured?

30
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.030
So according to Philip, he's going to measure it.

31
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.930
The only way you can measure it is in his reference rate and that broken train is moving.

32
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.870
So his time is different than the time of the wave train that was sent out.

33
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.390
So we put a little prime to designate that here are no good accounting, good organizational skills.

34
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.530
We put a price for the theater so we could take this guy here, but we have to make note that it's measured

35
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.780
in Terrence's reference frames.

36
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.750
So let's do that right now.

37
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.060
So what we did in our derivation.

38
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:24.610
We said one or two pi times the derivative and Phillips reference frame of this quantity here.

39
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.770
So we grouped the two by, if not, we pull them out and then we just get T minus x number.

40
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.680
So this is where we left off in the previous derivation, which you should feel comfortable with.

41
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.270
You don't feel comfortable with that.

42
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.260
Back up a bit in the different lectures review.

43
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.280
That's before you proceed.

44
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.420
But what we need to do now is make note that, OK.

45
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.330
Again, as I said, this quantity is theta.

46
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.710
It's not theta prime.

47
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:59.050
So to convert to Theta Prime, we would need to convert this tea and this X into that measured by Philip.

48
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.380
OK.

49
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.080
So when we take this and we keep track of the derivative, what variable that's in terms of, we're

50
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.950
going to find that the correct result pops out due to the chain.

51
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.760
OK.

52
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.750
And I'll do in the next portion of this derivation, I'll use the Lawrence transformation where we could

53
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.600
actually factor these guys out the X in the Ti to get x prime and Ti prime.

54
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.820
But we're going to let the math handle that.

55
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.460
OK, so we could do going up here.

56
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.780
We know that the two pie pops out that cancels with this guy.

57
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.680
So that cancels with that the f.

58
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.920
Not that's the source frequency as measured by Terrance.

59
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.150
That's going to pop out and.

60
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:47.930
We get the following.

61
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.500
So when we apply or derivative, we're going to get a third of tea with respect to tea from that looks

62
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.280
a little weird.

63
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.370
We'll go over that in a little bit and then we get the minus one over C because the derivative of a

64
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.710
constant it pops out from the C pops out.

65
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.160
And then we take the derivative of X as measured by parents with respect to the time as measured by

66
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.580
fill up.

67
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.120
So again, this is sort of a weird idea here.

68
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.740
When we get when we get this term, the X, the prime like what?

69
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:21.920
What does that actually mean?

70
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.950
Because we have an ambiguous relationship between these two frames so well, you really have to do is,

71
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.030
well, this guy.

72
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.100
This is in terms of time, right?

73
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.600
So all you can really do is DST and then use the the chain rule because, right, we're doing it in

74
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.650
terms of teh prime.

75
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.860
And I know that T is a function of T price.

76
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.660
So the way I should have really written this is that like that.

77
00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.980
So you take it with that.

78
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.450
You do d, d, c times d t, d t, right?

79
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.790
So it sounds a little weird.

80
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:56.840
Let me read it out for you.

81
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.900
D T, D T, right?

82
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.330
So we get the following derivative right here, thanks to the Chabrol.

83
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.110
So what we can do is this well, we can use this guy right here.

84
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.980
So what's the derivative of this, the spec to try?

85
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.290
Well, it's just, well, we take this guy here.

86
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.970
That guy pops up, right?

87
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.930
So this.

88
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.930
It's no different than Gamma, and we could do the same thing here, Gamma.

89
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.210
All right, the gamma pops out.

90
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.140
OK.

91
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:40.720
Because remember, this is the important fact this guy is a constant because the relative and sea are

92
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.540
not changing in special relativity, right?

93
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.860
That's part of our assumption.

94
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:50.080
So if this is constant, we have Constantine's a thriller that is just the constant.

95
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.220
That's all I did.

96
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:58.960
So we see that by keeping track of our reference frames, labeling everything appropriately following

97
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.470
the math, the chain rule pops out this Lorenz turn.

98
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.900
OK, so we get the following as such.

99
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:12.330
And then we just pull this guy out, say we get gamma times one minus B relative privacy, right?

100
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.300
The gavel popped out times our source frequency.

101
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.400
And when you look at this, you say, Oh, wait a minute.

102
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.390
That's the result.

103
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.340
We had previously worked for further.

104
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.670
We would get the same result.

105
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.250
So again.

106
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.430
It's sort of a more mathematical approach to what we were doing.

107
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.000
You could do what we did previously say conceptually this if not, is measured in terms of parents,

108
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.760
and we just have to get a gamma that doesn't really sit as well with me.

109
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.810
So I want to run through this and show you that, yes, if you make use of your your relative relativistic

110
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:55.650
ideas and so on and so forth that you've been practicing, you can get the result from mathematical

111
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.340
principles.

112
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:02.130
And that's what I want to do is wrap up this derivation of the relativistic Doppler shift.

113
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:11.980
I want to read to write this using the Lorenz transformation so that it can be useful as a third derivation.

114
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.220
And then I want to compare this result.

115
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.430
The final result that we got previously, you know, the square root of one minus the rollover C or

116
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.260
the square one plus irrelevancy.

117
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:29.590
I want to compare that to the non realistic equation, which we found to be pretty accurate for a lot

118
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.610
of manmade vehicles.

119
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.900
And see if it's similar or if it's completely and utterly different.

120
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:36.310
Stay tuned.
