1
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,570
All right.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,260
In the last few videos, we derived a Doppler shift equation that is used for determining the apparent

3
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,420
frequency from a reference frame that's moving away from some kind of radar source.

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,440
Now in those videos, I noticed that when we got the equation, which I have right here, when we derive

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,260
that equation, I thought that it was inherently a non relativistic result.

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,960
And as we ran through the derivation, you yourself probably should have noted that I was making certain

7
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,950
assumptions that were not quite true, given what you currently know about time dilation, length,

8
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,870
contraction, so on and so forth.

9
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,740
OK.

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:10,230
So in those videos, what I I asserted was that time was absolute between a moving reference frame in

11
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,160
a stationary reference frame attached to a radar source.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,510
And we know that to be inherently wrong because we study time dilation and we know that a moving body

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,780
is observed, its clock is observed to tick slow.

14
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,770
So if we don't account for that result, wouldn't that insinuate that the Doppler shift equation we

15
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,170
derive right here is not correct?

16
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,370
And it would yield incorrect predictions on the frequency observed by somebody in a moving reference

17
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,670
frame.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,920
You would think that, but in order to assess how valid or how invalid our previous result is, we have

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,540
to take a look at the general relative velocities we observe in everyday situations.

20
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,810
And then what we're going to do is we're going to derive a more accurate and more precise Doppler shift

21
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,690
equation that accounts for relativistic effects and accounts for what we learned for when we study time

22
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,110
dilation.

23
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,400
OK?

24
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,990
But back it up.

25
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,180
What we want to do is want to take a look at the relative speeds we're going to observe in any kind

26
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,870
of radar system.

27
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,830
Now, a radar system.

28
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,670
Generally, what it's trying to do is trying to detect any kind of enemy, target, man-made kind of

29
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,010
vehicle that fly through the air for defense purposes.

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,620
And that's the main objective and a missile defense system.

31
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,000
OK.

32
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:36,870
So what I've tabulated, I've searched you, Google, and I found the fastest manmade vehicle, which

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,440
is actually a vehicle designed by one of my previous companies, Lockheed Martin.

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,200
It's an SLR 71 Blackbird.

35
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:53,670
And what we found is that this can travel up to speeds of approximately 20 100 miles per hour.

36
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,830
So that's a very fast speed.

37
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,580
But relative to the speed of light, is that faster?

38
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,210
Is that slow?

39
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,640
Whoa, you look at this, you know, like, whoa, wait a minute.

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,170
I don't usually deal at the speed of light in terms of miles per hour, right?

41
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,920
I like the seafood assistance.

42
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,380
So let's first calculate the relative velocity by by converting our speed of light and then throwing

43
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,050
it into our general equation we generally use.

44
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:26,160
So we know that the world have lost EBITA is equal to the velocity of our target, oversee the speed

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,550
of light.

46
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,160
So we have the maximum loss who had ever observed with a manmade vehicle up to twenty one hundred miles

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,760
per hour.

48
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,470
And then when we convert the speed of light, you can use Google, you can use Mathematica, you can

49
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,530
use MATLAB, or you can do the calculation by hand, right?

50
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,650
You need to convert meters to miles, seconds, two hours.

51
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:50,850
We get that it comes out to be six point seven zero six times 10 to the eight miles per hour.

52
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,850
So you can see this is this is out of the ballpark compared to this guy.

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,660
But so when we do the calculation, we find that the relative velocity is three point one times 10 to

54
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,080
the minus six, and that is unit less tuneless.

55
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,120
So we get a result like this based on what you study previously.

56
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,360
What does that tell us?

57
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:17,760
What does that indicate that indicates that our Lorenz factor this guy right here, this guy is going

58
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,090
to be approximately equal to one, right?

59
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:25,650
It's going to be approximately equal to one because what we have found is that that equation.

60
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,200
Right.

61
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,520
It goes where this is one, it basically goes one for a lot of.

62
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,710
Portion and then it shoots up and becomes often that high rollers have lost.

63
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,700
So we know that we are probably closer to this region here.

64
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:50,920
What that tells us is that relativistic effects should not really arise if and this is the conditional,

65
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,850
the important conditional.

66
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:59,170
If we're only trying to detect manmade vehicles, which cannot go close to the speed of light yet,

67
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:07,180
OK, so relativistic effects should not arise for manmade targets and the equation we derived this guy

68
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,370
right here is still quite accurate.

69
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,880
And that is why if you look up some radar textbooks, you're going to find this equation and you're

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,460
going to see it sometimes in computations.

71
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,400
There's going to be a slight error, but that error is in essence negligible unless you're going into

72
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,070
very precise measurements you're trying to make.

73
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,070
So there is value in using this equation equation, which is derived.

74
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,400
And you know, we went through the two way Doppler shift to figure out what the frequency would be back

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,760
here.

76
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,390
So that can give us some accurate results and still make use of that.

77
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:49,000
But let's say we want stuff that is 100 percent accurate, something that converges completely upon

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,520
reality, right?

79
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,230
We're trying to get this universal conception of reality.

80
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,470
That's the point, of course.

81
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,870
So if we're going to do that, what we can do is we can go to Tarrance and fill up and say, Hey, guys,

82
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,310
help us out here.

83
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,750
We want to do another experiment.

84
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,060
What you did was it's not quite right.

85
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,560
Fix it, fix.

86
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,130
And they say, Hey, man, since we talked, we quit our job as scientists and we became actors.

87
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,250
So we're actors on the set of Star Trek.

88
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,870
And what we found is that, you know, they have a lot of manmade vehicles that travel close to the

89
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,470
speed of light.

90
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:27,480
Whether or not this is true and ours is possible actually found, but this is not quite possible based

91
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,380
on physical laws that these guys can go faster than the speed of light.

92
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,060
But we're going to assume it's going to go close to the speed of light.

93
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,810
And.

94
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,530
Tears of Philip say, Hey, this is pretty interesting, I'm going to dive back into my science.

95
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,210
They're going to help us out there to help us derive the relativistic Doppler shift.

96
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,670
And Rudy is USS Enterprise won't assume it's going to fly straight out to the right.

97
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,570
We're not parachuting beans at it trying to figure out.

98
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,270
How long or the apparent frequency?

99
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,740
That the US has enterprise actually observes, and you could use any kind of fast vehicle.

100
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,930
We have to generally use fancy.

101
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,330
I'm not a big Star Trek fan.

102
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,150
Maybe you could use Star Wars Millennium Falcon going straight out.

103
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,090
The point is, we want the relative velocity to be approximately equal to the speed of light and maybe

104
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:27,630
point nine, nine times C, I say at minimum point five times the speed of light to get from relativistic

105
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,960
effects, we get to this point on the curve where it's awesome.

106
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,260
OK, so if we take this, we can say, Oh, I'm not going to do these convoluted derivations because

107
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:45,180
previously I found this result and this for a target moving away from the source, moving away from

108
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,650
the radar.

109
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,890
OK, so we know that's true because if it's moving away, we know that the distance each wave has to

110
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,800
travel is going to be an extra v delta T.

111
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,780
So with the crest this guy sees, they're going to be separated by the distance.

112
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,900
The frequency is going to decrease.

113
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:04,440
Right?

114
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:10,680
OK, so we got this result and it's not quite right because we know that from time dilation, we cannot

115
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,490
assume, as we did in the previous generation, that Delta T prime equals Delta T or the.

116
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:25,110
The time difference, as observed by the USS Enterprise, cannot be equivalent to what terrorist measures

117
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
we got fill up on the U.S. enterprise, and he's going to measure a different time.

118
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,520
Right?

119
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,140
Space time tends to bend to account for the second posture, the special relativity.

120
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,550
That's what we learned, right?

121
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
Let's put it to use right now.

122
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:45,420
So we say that, OK, well, when time was observed by somebody who stationary or Terence Delta T,

123
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,630
it has to be delayed by this Lorentz factor.

124
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,470
We have the gamma times deputy prime reguilon's defined as such.

125
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,770
So what we could do is we could take a look at the times that are measured in our equation here.

126
00:08:59,310 --> 00:08:59,730
So.

127
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:11,610
When Terence shoots out these pins every time he sees a crest or the frequency cycles per second, this

128
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,240
is measured in terms of his reference range in terms of Delta T.

129
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,710
In other words, he's measuring the number of press emitted for a time period.

130
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,210
Delta T observed in the radar system.

131
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:32,370
What Tarrant or Philip is interested in on the USS Enterprise is he wants something a bit different.

132
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,560
He still wants to measure these red crests hitting his vehicle.

133
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:44,460
However, he's measuring the number of press received for a time period Delta T Prime.

134
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,670
Which is different, a novelty as we learn in time dilation.

135
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,450
He wants it for a time for Delta T Prime observed in the U.S. enterprise.

136
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,550
The time he sees would be different than the time Terrence seized.

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:09,960
So if that's what we're really looking for, then this equation we start off with cannot be quite right

138
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,370
because Philip, once cycles per deputy prime, the number of cycles per his time measurement.

139
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:27,700
But he's calculating it in terms of these quantities in X source is the number of cycles per regular

140
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,040
delta, the Delta T in the radar system.

141
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,010
So what we need to do is we need to convert this time and if we can do that.

142
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,410
Then we can get the correct result, so we go back to time relation.

143
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,730
And we say, OK, Delta T is equal to Gamma Deputy Prime.

144
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,490
We can flip, we can flip.

145
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,630
Both of these to get one Delta T equals one of a gamma delta T prime and multiply the game over to the

146
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,670
left, and we get this equation here.

147
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:07,490
We see that if we multiply gamma over here, we get a camera T or get gamma over Delta team and that

148
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,100
transforms into a one over a deputy prime, which would get what we really want because what we have

149
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,950
now if fill up.

150
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,060
Takes everything on the right.

151
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,690
He would get cycles of respect to Terrence's clock.

152
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,340
So we want to convert it over.

153
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,460
OK, so what we could do is.

154
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,800
We would take this Lawrence factor, multiply it in here.

155
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,920
Laurence Packer, Delta T, I guess this one of Delta T Prime the number here, he's really measuring

156
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,310
this.

157
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:47,990
But when we multiply by gamma, it turns into what we once were the cycle per Delta T prime.

158
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,000
OK, so this is important.

159
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,020
Make sure you understand this is a conceptual derivation.

160
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,970
We'll go back, take a more convoluted or a more mathematically intensive approach next.

161
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:09,710
But if we just want to convert this result into a relativistic result, we just have to make note that,

162
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:19,070
OK, we're calculating in terms of clock multiply by gamma that will make it in terms of the USS Enterprise

163
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,160
s clock and what we want right here.

164
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,310
OK, so when we do that, we multiply by gamma.

165
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,070
Right.

166
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:34,630
On both sides, actually, and then this turns into the correct form we want as measured by the.

167
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,020
And all we need to do is just plug in this guy right here, so we just take the gavel, that's a one

168
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,610
over square root of one, minus the relative over C squared.

169
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:53,390
This guy comes along for the ride, the one minus the relative ever c times the source frequency.

170
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,760
And then we just need to do some math.

171
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:56,450
OK.

172
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,250
So what we could do is.

173
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:06,460
Well, you know that one minus x squared is equal to one minus x times one plus x, right?

174
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:14,380
So we could do that on the bottom and we get the square root one minus the rail or C and one plus Fiorillo

175
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:22,800
C, and that on the top, we can make note that this guy is no different than this quantity squared

176
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:23,890
or two of them.

177
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:30,460
And then you take the square root, so the top becomes the square root of one minus v relevancy has

178
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,900
one minus the irrelevancy.

179
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,010
I didn't do anything because it's technically this guy squared.

180
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,100
Take the square root band.

181
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,550
You recover the original term, right?

182
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,410
We didn't do anything.

183
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,490
We didn't do anything special.

184
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,750
So if we take this guy and we say, Oh, look at this man, look at that.

185
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,030
We can cancel out parliamentarians, bam, we cancel that with that guy right there.

186
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,920
And what we end up with is our relativistic result quite quickly.

187
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:05,020
Just by taking our understanding of time and swapping those guys out with the rest factor, we end up

188
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,600
with the following equation, which is a bit more convoluted than our previous result.

189
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:19,540
Not as nice, but it gives us that the observed frequency at the target as measured as measured by fill

190
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,780
up.

191
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:27,390
It's going to be the square root of one minus relative velocity of a C over the square root of one.

192
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,830
Plus the relative velocity oversea times the source frequency, and it's important to note that this

193
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:39,630
only applies for a target moving away from the source.

194
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:47,400
If we want to move towards the source right, the relative, the sign with swish must be coming in this

195
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:47,970
direction.

196
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,760
All we need to do is change the signs.

197
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:58,110
And you should be able to reason through it because if it's going away, you would expect the frequency

198
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,740
to be lower.

199
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:06,420
So currently, one minus the quantity, you may get a 0.5 five, you're taking like a fraction of something.

200
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,980
Divide it by one plus you divide it by like one or two.

201
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,520
So this is making the frequency smaller as expected.

202
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,870
Switch the signs.

203
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:18,540
We're going to get one plus a ratio.

204
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,380
So that's going to increase it divided by one minus.

205
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,330
So we're dividing dividing by a fraction, which means it's going to increase it further.

206
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:34,240
So then as it travels close, you're increasing that frequency because you're decreasing the distance

207
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,010
each wave has to travel.

208
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,430
So the apparent frequency to fill up would be increased.

209
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:46,390
So if you were really concerned about accuracy, really concerned about maybe your radar algorithm being

210
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:50,590
precise and converging from reality, you want to use this equation here.

211
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:55,180
This is the relativistic Doppler shift we obtained.

212
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,480
What I want to do next is, you know, there were sort of sort of felt like we're doing some hand waving.

213
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:08,440
I want to do a more direct derivation of back up in terms of what we're doing for this guide and show

214
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,420
you how we can derive this exactly.

215
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,740
And why is that important?

216
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,820
Why is that important?

217
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,670
Because if you derive a result once, that's nice, it's fine.

218
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:16,750
And.

219
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:25,120
But if you can derive it twice or three times, that would increase the validity of the result you get.

220
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,480
It increases your confidence.

221
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,880
OK, so let's do that.

222
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,560
I want you to be confident in this result and understand where it came from.
