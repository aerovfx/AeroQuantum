1
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.710
OK.

2
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.750
By this point, you're probably tired of hearing about a physical interpretation of the Doppler shift.

3
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:31.190
We've banged it home, ready to proceed and start deriving what that Doppler ship actually is going

4
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.580
to be.

5
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.400
OK, so to do this, I'm going to do it in multiple ways.

6
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.720
I'm going to do it in approach that's aligned with what we're talking about here.

7
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.870
It's more of a physical, intuition based approach.

8
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.870
And then I'm going to repeat the derivation by taking a look at ENM waves, OK?

9
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.050
And we're going to find that the result pops out naturally from the mathematics, as you've probably

10
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.720
heard me say multiple times in previous courses.

11
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.900
If you dry, result once, that's awesome.

12
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.750
If you can derive multiple times, that strength is the likelihood of it being true and increases your

13
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.320
confidence.

14
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.180
That's the route we're going to take.

15
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.930
OK.

16
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.070
So for this derivation, we're going to use the scenario I outlined with Terrence and fill up.

17
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.520
And what is important is taking a look.

18
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.430
At the total length of the weight room, as I outlined right there.

19
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.450
Now, normally if we had an emission of a wave and it was received by a stationary observer, the length

20
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:41.900
of the wave chain, which is B and C T or rather, you know, give you the total number of emitter waves

21
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.470
three times.

22
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:50.660
In this case, what we find is that after time, t from a transmission to receival terrace to when it

23
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.290
was received.

24
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.310
We know that the waves traveled C times T, right, two meters per second time time that gets meters,

25
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.310
but it didn't have to travel that entire distance because it's being decreased the distance that has.

26
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.520
So the total distance it has to travel would be c t minus b t.

27
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.690
OK.

28
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:19.440
So what we want to try and compute is the new wavelength that's observed by Philip.

29
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.750
Why did he observe a different frequency?

30
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.390
Why did he observe a different wavelength?

31
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.260
Let's try that.

32
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.260
So to signify that rather I'm going to call it land the Prime.

33
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.250
And the original parameter is going to have a not.

34
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.380
But we said that the distance that was traveled by the wave is.

35
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:49.710
CC, the total time elapsed, observe from source to receiver, same rounder's, the key characteristics

36
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.470
we talked about minus the speed of that observer and the same time.

37
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.650
So that's the total distance traveled.

38
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.720
And in that time, in that time, we know that terrorists emitted and we the total number of ways to

39
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.120
run time.

40
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.100
So we take the time, the distance it traveled and divide by the number of waves emitted.

41
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.300
Remember the number ways and the number of wavelengths that will give you our new apparent wavelength?

42
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.620
Right.

43
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.090
So let's do that calculation.

44
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.720
Let's do that.

45
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.730
So you divide by and here.

46
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.090
And then next, what we want to do is we say, Hey, Philip is going to observe this new wavelength

47
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.070
due to the motion.

48
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.030
Of his reference frame, his different perspective, if you will, next, what we want to do is we want

49
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.180
to see how that affects the frequency, right?

50
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.230
We know the frequency is related wavelength as such.

51
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.520
OK, so let's try and calculate a new relative.

52
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.930
Frequency asked Prime.

53
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.370
So if you use our definition, we can say that's just see.

54
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.760
Over our new relative wavelength.

55
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.440
Let's see how that affects.

56
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.930
How about affects our frequency so we could just take?

57
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.460
This guy right here.

58
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.210
So let's see the bottom by all this, the end pops up.

59
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.830
We get see.

60
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:26.740
And over C C minus B C.

61
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.710
OK, so I know what you're saying, you're probably like, oh, we didn't even we barely even made any

62
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.510
progress here.

63
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.420
What are we doing?

64
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.140
This looks more tolerable.

65
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.330
What she could do actually is you can pull out the sea.

66
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.670
Right.

67
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.510
We have sea over sea, just a one.

68
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.680
And to make this.

69
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.520
Easier.

70
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.930
I'm going to pull up the tea, also love this guy right here.

71
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.560
Not irate there.

72
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.980
And we know that is on the bottom line is Betty.

73
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.540
So we want to get rid of the C, so we take this guy and divide by sea.

74
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.620
OK, so now we got that, that apparently nice value here and we can cancel that.

75
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.780
See, so we end up with the foul.

76
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.500
Next, we want to do is we want to make note of this.

77
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.600
OK, so we know that.

78
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.930
If we take a situation where the observer is still right, we take this.

79
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:44.140
We know we could take the initial frequency multiply by the time traveled, and that will give us the

80
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.980
number of weeks.

81
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.700
Right.

82
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.910
The frequency is how frequent this cycle occurs every second.

83
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.260
Multiply by the total time that gives you the total number of wavelengths, in essence, the total number

84
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.050
of bit of width.

85
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.440
So if we use this fact?

86
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.240
Using.

87
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.070
This guy right here.

88
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:13.620
And the equal, the original frequency, f not horns, our teeth.

89
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.490
We could plug this guy in here and we get a pretty interesting result.

90
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.100
So we end up with f prime.

91
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.170
Is equal to if not.

92
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.310
See?

93
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:34.050
Over three times, one minus v, over C.

94
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.380
OK, so if we cancel the total time observed and now you can see, see that was sort of a term that

95
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.200
was used to try and pull out this result.

96
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.650
We get the final result we end up with.

97
00:06:51.020 --> 00:07:00.230
The relative frequency is defined as the original frequency, if not divided by one minus V.

98
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.860
Oversee, OK.

99
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:10.970
It's important results, and what we want to do is take a look at this and see if we can understand

100
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.500
what's going on.

101
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.180
So what's really cool is.

102
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.320
We've seen the definition that it talks about a phenomenon caused by relative motion, so you would

103
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.090
expect to have a velocity that velocity of your reference frame.

104
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.800
And we do observe that in the final result, we have this one minus B over C term.

105
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.180
But let's take different situations and see if it makes sense.

106
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.010
So if we take this situation where the velocity is moving towards the source.

107
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.870
Right.

108
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:48.810
So we put an age as a positive value v, we see that one minus fee, which is less than C, so it's

109
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.860
like one minus 0.5.

110
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.570
So it's like multiplying the frequency.

111
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.420
So we're increasing the frequency.

112
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:03.870
We get an increased frequency and that makes sense because as I said, as tears or fill of flies, twist

113
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.350
stands.

114
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:11.670
He's decreasing the distance between the wave and him, so his apparent observation of that, he sees

115
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:13.470
more crests or more droughts.

116
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.180
Right.

117
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.750
The wavelengths watch for in between that wave, right?

118
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.870
So it makes sense that his frequency is increasing.

119
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.880
Now, if he's flying in the opposite direction, what we could do is.

120
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.900
We just change the sign of big.

121
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:36.150
So if that happens, this gets a positive in on the bottom.

122
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:38.430
This is always greater than one.

123
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:44.970
So we're making that frequency shorter, which makes sense because as Phil flies out, he's increasing

124
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:50.550
the distance between the wave and his observation point that has to travel.

125
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.420
So he experiences less crests or less throughout.

126
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.820
OK, so that's what is happening.

127
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.460
And the same exact thing can happen if your source is moving towards a stationary observer.

128
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.450
Right?

129
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.090
The observer is going to experience that shift.

130
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.050
This is what we observed with the ambulance that I talked about previously.

131
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:11.160
Same idea.

132
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.570
What is important is the relative motion between the two.

133
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.740
OK, so that's going to dictate the sign in this case.

134
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.270
What we have here, I put a negative here and this.

135
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:32.800
This scenario is going to represent the case where the distance between the two is shortening, the

136
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.090
relative motion is towards one another, the source and the receiver are moving towards one another

137
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.950
if they're moving in the opposite direction.

138
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.600
It is a sign and you get results when you run through problems.

139
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:49.540
It'll be important to know distinct the two different scenarios and use them, as such as the relative

140
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.520
motion, whether it's closing up or opening up.

141
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.910
OK.

142
00:09:55.270 --> 00:10:03.610
The last thing I want to do before we move on a bit is I want to make a distinction between what you

143
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.950
may observe in a textbook.

144
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.920
And.

145
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.290
The result we just arrived because.

146
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.120
This may be a source of confusion, and I want to eliminate that from what we're doing.

147
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.810
So if you open up a textbook on Doppler shifts, we do some kind of search.

148
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.830
You might see this result, but you might see a different result.

149
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.810
OK, so what I want to say is that.

150
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.930
If we take this, we can simplify it a bit further.

151
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.350
Right?

152
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.150
So one, if we if we assume this guy we oversee.

153
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.290
Is X our variable?

154
00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.470
We say one over one minus X.

155
00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:51.310
You actually do a Taylor series or something known as a binomial expansion, and you can express this

156
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:51.850
as.

157
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.660
The Sun over NW from an equals zero.

158
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.890
To Infinity.

159
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.200
I believe it's X to the end.

160
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.750
That's correct, x to the N.

161
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:11.700
And that's just going to equal one.

162
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.880
Plus X.

163
00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.440
Plus x squared.

164
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.150
Over two factorial.

165
00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:29.980
OK, so that can go on infinitely.

166
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:36.130
But the important thing to note is that if X is very small and I've run through the starvation multiple

167
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.580
times, YouTube videos, my courses, so on and so forth.

168
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.110
This is really small.

169
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.950
The square, a small value is extremely small.

170
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:54.100
So this relative to this is much more as X gets small y you could do is you can approximate this.

171
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.050
As approximately.

172
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:08.550
One plus x, so what you may observe is that f prime.

173
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:16.860
The observed frequency is equal to the original source frequency over one minus VRC.

174
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.310
But it's also.

175
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.170
One plus the embassy.

176
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.810
Times at not.

177
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:39.320
And this is applicable when VRC it much less than one.

178
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.830
OK, and especially a radar.

179
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.810
Radar computations when?

180
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.540
The observer velocity is very small compared to the speed of light.

181
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:56.770
This is much more useful and much easier to work with because you can see the shift quite clearly,

182
00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.010
right?

183
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.040
If V is positive, it's moving toward each other.

184
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.390
The frequency increases.

185
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:07.000
If it's moving away from each other, put a negative in here one minus that parameter, you're decreasing

186
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.630
the frequency.

187
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.890
It's easier to work with.

188
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:10.870
But what have we done?

189
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:18.520
What we have done is we briefly reviewed some parameters for the waves that allowed us to drive this

190
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.090
universal conception between two different perspectives.

191
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:22.600
Right?

192
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:29.830
So by running through this analysis, we developed this bridge that we bridge that gap between two different

193
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.700
perspectives.

194
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:40.120
And that allowed us to derive a more inclusive language that encapsulates reality and covers everything

195
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.320
we could observe.

196
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.340
In essence.

197
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:50.110
It's a a more accurate and more inclusive perspective, while in reality on the universe.

198
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:57.700
OK, so we observed that when there's relative motion between reference frames, that relative motion

199
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:03.520
helps to drive a shift in frequency when we're dealing with waves in sound.

200
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.640
This could be a change in pitch as we're going to find.

201
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:08.710
With light waves.

202
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.730
That change.

203
00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.270
It's going to be known as a red shift can change the color.

204
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.700
Of observed entities, whether it be stars and astronomy, so on and so forth.

205
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:26.680
If you're in the ocean, if you're a surfer, you have waves coming up and down and you're moving into

206
00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.160
the wave.

207
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.030
It could be how choppy the water appears.

208
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.850
OK, so that's the Doppler shift.

209
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.770
This is more of a physical intuition, a derivation from physical principles.

210
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.850
That's what I'm going to take a look at is a propagating electromagnetic wave.

211
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.890
Just because we're dealing with radar and, you know, radar emits light.

212
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.490
So we're going to try to derive the same results.

213
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:57.060
By taking a mathematical representation of a propagating wave.

214
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:05.220
And then working through all the math to find out the same result pops out and strengthen.

215
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.450
Well, he's just arrived.

216
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.680
Stay tuned.
