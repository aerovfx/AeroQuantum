1
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.430
All right.

2
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.870
To wrap up this session and give you some experience at the concepts we've been talking about, namely

3
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.760
the Doppler shift, what I thought would be a good idea is to run through an example problem where you

4
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.710
design your own radar system.

5
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.600
It's going to be a simplified one and also work through some of the problems you might encounter when

6
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.730
trying to execute it and implement it in the real world.

7
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.780
OK, so for the problem statement, for this example problem, we're going to take a look at Terrance

8
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.270
and Phillip.

9
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.700
Terrance is going to try and monitor the traffic using a radar gun that you're going to design, and

10
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.630
he's going to try assess the velocity of Philip riding in his car away from him.

11
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.240
So the problem statement says to monitor the traffic.

12
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.080
Terrence designed a radar gun that emits a signal with a frequency, if not a 36 gigahertz.

13
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.980
You decide that you're going to send out this signal, it's going to have that frequency.

14
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.490
And as we discussed previously, we want to fly out, hit the car, come back and measure the frequency

15
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.150
we obtain.

16
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.910
That's going to give us information regarding the velocity.

17
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.510
But the rest of the province states that when Philip flies by, parents is gone, receives the emitted

18
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.700
signal back with a frequency change.

19
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.920
We're going to measure the change in the frequency, the what the wave form that comes back.

20
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.700
We're going to get a delta of negative ten point three two kilohertz.

21
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.730
And what we want to figure out is how fast is Philip traveling when he's traveling away from parents?

22
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.330
Now, when you work through this problem and you're trying to design an algorithm for calculating the

23
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.510
velocity of the car that's speeding up, what you have to ask is what equation drives, what equation

24
00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.050
do I use?

25
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.380
The first thing you're going to say is, well, parent or fill up is traveling in a car at a speed that

26
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.760
is Newtonian.

27
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.590
In a sense, it's not just the speed of light.

28
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:15.610
So can we or can we not get away of using a simplified non relativistic form of the Doppler shift equation?

29
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.060
Can we?

30
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.540
Yes, indeed we can, because he's going to be traveling very slow, and that's the justification for

31
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.960
using it.

32
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.670
We're getting high accuracy with the simplified non relativistic equation.

33
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.620
So that's the first equation we're going to use.

34
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.940
And that's a question we have to ask is how many times of the Doppler shift that phenomenon, that concept,

35
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.890
how many times is it applied?

36
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.000
Well, initially we shoot out a beam, then it's going to hit the car.

37
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.610
So we're going to have a Doppler shift that fill up actually seasonless car, but then it's going to

38
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.930
bounce back and come back.

39
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.040
And because he's traveling away, he's increasing the distance between them.

40
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.650
It's going to experience another Doppler shift.

41
00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.500
Now what we talk about when running through Doppler shifts and radar in particular, that's the main

42
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.020
application we had in the section.

43
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.180
So we have to have a 280 opposite.

44
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:12.460
So it's important when you design your algorithm, you use this equation here for the non relativistic

45
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.730
Doppler shift, which accounts for the phenomenon twice.

46
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.690
All right, now that we have a general form of the equation, we're going to use for our algorithm.

47
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.440
Next, we want a question do we want a positive sign here or a negative sign, right?

48
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.010
Depending upon the situation at hand, whether the car is traveling away or traveling toward the radar

49
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.910
gun, we're going to get different effects arising right when it's traveling away.

50
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.590
That's increasing the wavelength, but decreasing the frequency right.

51
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.390
So when the the object is moving away from the source, we need to put a negative sign, right?

52
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.120
We want the frequency to be smaller, right, because it's not going to hit him as frequently when it's

53
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.260
traveling towards him.

54
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.060
We would need a positive sign.

55
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.060
So we've selected the correct equation here and now all we need to do is isolate the term that we're

56
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.600
interested in.

57
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.870
So where is it in the relative velocity of fill up the parents respect to his radar gun?

58
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.780
And what we could do is we could say, wait a second, the frequency of the beam with that comes back,

59
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.190
right?

60
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.160
We we we don't know that because our device is going to measure a change in frequency and that's typically

61
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.000
what you observe.

62
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.060
And a lot of radar guns when it's doing these computations.

63
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.260
So we have to convert this first to use the terms that we do have are givens and then we can isolate

64
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:37.420
the re the V relative and get a nice expression for what our radar gun should be computing once it gets

65
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.920
all these quantities back, OK?

66
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.780
So we know that f prime would be f not plus the change, right?

67
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:53.980
Because the change, the change Delta F not or Delta F, this is no different than the final, which

68
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.200
would be f prime minus f not only make that more pronounced for you.

69
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.570
So when you add that to f, not the f not cancel on your left with the f prime original.

70
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.490
So we're going to substitute in that equation here.

71
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.000
So f not you can literally just isolated f prime is equal to Delta F plus f not.

72
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.410
And then when you divide by.

73
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.100
Sky on the left right here.

74
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.140
We do that, we end up with this expression and now all you need to do is isolate the relatives.

75
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.740
So what we're going to do is we're going to subtract this already here.

76
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.830
We're going to take to the Yellow Sea over here.

77
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.560
So we end up with a one minus this term here, which is showing up in our final form right there.

78
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.200
And then we have to be row over sea over here.

79
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.320
All we need to do is multiply by sea over two.

80
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.320
That's how we get that guy.

81
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.360
And this is our final expression.

82
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.490
OK, so we've got this nice expression here.

83
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.250
And what's going to happen when we set up a signal?

84
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.150
It's going to bounce off.

85
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.140
It's kind of come back.

86
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.890
We're going to measure, we're going to measure the change in the frequency.

87
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.700
And then it's going to do a competition like this and display the last.

88
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.660
That's how radar guns in police cars actually work.

89
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.850
This is what they're doing behind the scene.

90
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.770
All you see is just the velocity, OK?

91
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.440
So it's a bit more complicated than that.

92
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.090
You know, you can't just have one single beam going on usually sends out like a cone.

93
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.460
So we get this wide spread, so it's easier to get a red signal back.

94
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.050
And there are some other problems that we're going to go through in the second part of this problem.

95
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:33.590
But this is an equation we could get right here now just for fun and just to emphasize that this equation

96
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.670
still is valid.

97
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:41.810
What I want to do is I also want to derive the same exact equation using a relativistic Doppler shift,

98
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.510
and then we're going to plug in numbers and see if there's any difference if we gain any kind of accuracy

99
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.320
by using a more complex and intricate form.

100
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.440
OK, so we're going to use a relativistic Doppler shift.

101
00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.100
We still have to use a two way Doppler shift, and we have to use the form for the object moving away

102
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.880
from the source.

103
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.030
So in our previous videos, what we found is that that form is as follows.

104
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.020
And we can use our intuition to make sure that it is of the correct form.

105
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.320
So what we know is that if it's traveling away, the frequency is going to drop because the wavelength

106
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.460
is going to increase right.

107
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.720
We're increasing that distance.

108
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:28.070
So the same number of crest not hit this vehicle if it was stationary.

109
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:35.330
So the equation we get the f prime should be smaller than the original frequency.

110
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.150
And we see that happening because one minus the fraction making it smaller over one plus a fraction.

111
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.080
If you divide by that, it's making it smaller even more.

112
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:50.210
So this is the correct form that we want to use and we want to do is we want to get rid of this f prime,

113
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.740
just as we did previously.

114
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:57.410
Using this equation here again, we isolate f prime the Delta F plus f not ban.

115
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.860
Plug that baby in and divide by this f not over here.

116
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:08.280
We can multiply that by the OnePlus virale over sea to get this guy, and all we need to do is try and

117
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:08.750
isolate.

118
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.150
So you can see, you know, as many more lines.

119
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:18.120
It's a little bit more convoluted to get the expression we want, and it becomes even more convoluted

120
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.470
if we're doing a one way Doppler shift where we have the square roots, they sort of cancel out because

121
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.520
we have to apply it twice.

122
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.090
But you can see it's a bit more complex complex already.

123
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:33.570
So is a trade off in terms of increasing the complexity in order to get some more accuracy, right?

124
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.800
So it requires some more work.

125
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.790
Let's just chug along.

126
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:42.000
So what we need to do is we need to isolate the relevancy, and what we could do is initially we can

127
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.790
just multiply by sea on both sides, which I'm going to do now.

128
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.310
We think that got rid of that, get rid of that.

129
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:59.490
And what happens is when you multiply by sea on both sides, see times one, we were all see the sea

130
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.210
disappears.

131
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.720
And you just get something like that.

132
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.660
That's what we want to do, is basically be relative.

133
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:13.170
So what we can do is we want to pull the V relatives onto one side, so we add this guy over, so we

134
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:19.530
get one plus B relative times this frequency fraction as follows.

135
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:19.960
OK.

136
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.170
And then we also want to isolate the CS on the right side.

137
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.040
We have one see you want to bring this C over, so it becomes a minus.

138
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:34.650
So we get C times one minus C times the frequency ratio, which is that's false.

139
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.060
And then all that's left really is to divide by this big hunk of junk.

140
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.930
And we get the following so you can see this guy compared to that guy.

141
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.700
It's not as elegant.

142
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.620
We don't get as quick of a solution.

143
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.910
And furthermore, I programmed some radar algorithms, which are much more complex than this.

144
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.170
But this is extremely support.

145
00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.860
You know, when you start getting a lot of fractions and divisions and so on and so forth, that has

146
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.860
the potential of introducing bugs introduced, introducing errors when you're actually trying to program

147
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:07.980
it.

148
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.860
So that comes at a cost, right?

149
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.860
You usually what you do is you program an algorithm and then you do testing to verify that it's operating

150
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.970
as expected.

151
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:18.810
That's good engineering.

152
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.240
That's good systems engineering, if you will.

153
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.840
So you have like a testing department and they would test all this information.

154
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:32.970
And if you find errors and if you have to test more things with a more convoluted equation that increases

155
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.690
your cost, and it also increases the chance for putting out a bad product.

156
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:38.780
And also your timeline?

157
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.080
OK.

158
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.230
So that's a trade off.

159
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:47.760
So you're real trading time, cost and potential defects by going with this more convoluted route.

160
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:48.060
OK.

161
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.190
This would be ideal if we get the accuracy that's I'm going to show you shortly.

162
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.290
OK, so we've got these two approaches now.

163
00:10:55.290 --> 00:11:01.080
All we need to do is plug and chug, put in our information and see what kind of result we get.

164
00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:06.990
So if we take our givens, which is the source frequency of thirty six gigahertz that we shoot out and

165
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:12.660
a change of negative ten point three two kilohertz and again, that makes sense because what it's going

166
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:18.870
further away, we're increasing the distance to half travel as a result, the frequency so we should

167
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:19.260
drop.

168
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:19.740
OK.

169
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.540
So taking that information and taking our form here for the non relativistic equation.

170
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.260
All I need to do is plug in shock.

171
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:33.560
So one minus ethanol plus Delta F. That's one minus 36 times tend to the night.

172
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.240
That's four gigahertz.

173
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.210
Minus ten thousand three hundred and twenty Hertz, four kilohertz.

174
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:46.950
Ten point three, two kilohertz and any divide by the original frequency of wave form, which is thirty

175
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.420
six points 10 to the ninth hertz.

176
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:53.190
And I just multiply by our speed of light three times Terminator two.

177
00:11:53.940 --> 00:12:00.600
And when you do that, it's your favorite program or your calculator to three, your preference.

178
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:07.080
You plug and chug and you end up with the relative is equal to 43 meters per second.

179
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.380
So that's how fast a slope is going.

180
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.150
And you can see Terry here has a little smirk on his face because he's noticing he can give him a ticket.

181
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:22.050
So he's excited because he he got revenge on Philip for making him do all those annoying experiments,

182
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:22.260
right?

183
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.570
OK, so we got that result here.

184
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.730
He's going forty three meters per second.

185
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.790
And this is a pretty viable design for a radar gun rights.

186
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.890
Very similar simple radar system.

187
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:33.930
So yes, be proud of yourself.

188
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.360
You have designed your first radar system.

189
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.540
It's probably the simplest radar system you can buy in a consumer marketplace.

190
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:47.970
OK, so let's repeat the exact same calculation using the relativistic result.

191
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.870
So when we do that, we see that, you know, it's not as nice.

192
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.830
It's much more convoluted.

193
00:12:52.830 --> 00:13:01.230
We got a ton of frickin fractions going on here, but all we need to do is take one minus f not plus

194
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.880
Delta F.

195
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:09.990
We got those guys their one minus f not plus Delta F, so three six times telling the truth hurts minus

196
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.950
ten thousand three hundred twenty hertz divided by the original frequency.

197
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:15.600
Thirty six to deny Hertz.

198
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.100
Then you divide all that junk by one plus thirty six.

199
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:26.460
The original frequency thirty six times to the ninth hertz plus Delta F, minus ten thousand three hundred

200
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:31.650
twenty hertz divided by the original frequency as follows thirty six gigahertz thirty six on Saturday

201
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:32.190
night Hertz.

202
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.380
And then you multiply by the speed of light the C right there, which is three times ten to the meters

203
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:37.890
per second.

204
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.790
And when you do that, plug and chug, what you end up with is low and behold.

205
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.920
It looks very similar, right?

206
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:51.180
We get forty three point zero zero zero zero zero six meters per second, so you see the difference

207
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.170
here and.

208
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.400
You know, you see this and you got you say, OK, that's a minimal difference, right?

209
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.410
This is essentially identical to this.

210
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:06.940
We put in all this work to get this more complex expression and equation and then really bias anything

211
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:07.150
right?

212
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:14.830
It can increase our time, our cost and the deficiencies in our final product by giving us no more additional

213
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:15.140
apps.

214
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.690
We don't need this accuracy because this, in essence, is pretty close to 43 meters per second.

215
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:25.540
If something was going 43 miles per seven miles per hour, that's how we usually measure things in the

216
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.580
United States standards.

217
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.830
You know, if you saw someone 40 miles per hour, you don't care if they're going that.

218
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.590
If they had that fraction in there, right, that's that's negligible, we don't care about that.

219
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.070
So you throw it out and generally radar systems with manmade targets.

220
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.530
That's why we use this.

221
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.120
This not an altruistic form.

222
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.980
It's more elegant.

223
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:52.770
It's simpler, and it expedites our path to the solution next.

224
00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:59.370
What I want to do is I want to question what would happen if, let's say, Terrence starts shooting

225
00:14:59.370 --> 00:14:59.670
off his.

226
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.640
And for some reason, he misses fill up.

227
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:09.030
Maybe there's clutter preventing him from reading his exact signal.

228
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:17.280
And as a result, he has to hop in a car and chase him in a cruiser and try and measure this while traveling

229
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.100
at a speed that is not stationary.

230
00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:21.870
OK, let's jump to that next.
