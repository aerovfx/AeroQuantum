1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,580
All right.

2
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,950
And our last video, we had our first encounter with a concept known as a Doppler shift.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,080
What do we find in that video?

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,490
We discovered that any kind of relative motion, whether it's closing the gap or opening the gap between

5
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:41,350
a source, an observer of any kind of waveform experiences, a change, a relative shift in that frequency,

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,700
and it's due to the relative motion between that observer and the source.

7
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,910
OK, so what the helped us do?

8
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,300
It helped us extend our universal conception of reality such that we could further bridge the gap between

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,250
different perspectives and get a nice, all inclusive perspective of the universe.

10
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:07,390
Now what I want to do in this video is take another look, another perspective of that same phenomenon

11
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,430
and derive the same exact result.

12
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:16,570
But this time, instead of taking a physical approach by using our physical observation and understanding

13
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:24,130
of the phenomenon at hand, what I want to do is take a more organic mathematical approach by taking

14
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,840
a look at ENM waves.

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,220
That's electro and magnetism waves.

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,690
OK.

17
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:34,090
So in order to do that first, what I want to do is I want to review what happens with the traveling,

18
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:41,260
propagating wave, and I want to use that information and some, some input we had in the beginning

19
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,450
of this course for the non relativistic shift between different perspectives.

20
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,730
We're going to use that to derive the same result to strengthen what we obtained and increase our confidence

21
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:53,020
in that result.

22
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:53,890
OK.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,490
So first and foremost, traveling waves, OK?

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,880
We're going to we're going to go over the key characteristics of sir.

25
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,850
So any kind of traveling way of what we have is just like we saw previously in the last video on some

26
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,900
function, which the function of X and time this is at time equals zero.

27
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,480
The independent variable is X.

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,190
When you have a source that emits wave, it's going to go up and down in a cyclical fashion.

29
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,560
It's going to have an amplitude, a that's going to be the maximum point of the crest and the travel

30
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,900
and one is propagating.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,810
We know that the wave moves in the right direction.

32
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,690
Now you study physics before, maybe also to throw away phenomenon some kind of stuff like that.

33
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,200
What you find is that we can describe this wave mathematically in two ways.

34
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,690
First.

35
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,410
What we can do is we can use the Euler identity to describe in terms of cool signs and signs that function,

36
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,010
which is the function of X and T, usually describe as the amplitude.

37
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,590
And this exponential function with J.

38
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,620
We're J is the square root of negative one.

39
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,280
An imaginary number times the quantity omega T minus K X. This representation.

40
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,990
Is intended to describe a wave of travels in the X direction, and I'm going to go over the difference

41
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,910
between traveling in the X direction and traveling in the negative X direction because they are a little

42
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,330
different.

43
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,080
And that's going to drive what we talk about in this lesson here.

44
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,850
First and foremost, what in the world is so mega?

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,090
And one, the world is this Kater?

46
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,980
And he studied the stuff previously.

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,410
You've probably found that K, which is the propagation constant or the wave number.

48
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,430
It describes how many radians are transpired per each wavelength of our waves.

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,110
The wave ones, as we described previously, is once like one complete cycle that wave.

50
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,930
And it's generally defined as K is equal to two pi over land at the wavelength.

51
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,430
That's the wave number.

52
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,550
We're trying to figure out how the angle changes with respect to one one wavelength.

53
00:03:59,640 --> 00:03:59,910
Right?

54
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,260
It's in terms of distance.

55
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,460
We also have omega, which is the angular frequency.

56
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,830
So conversely, to the propagation concept with wave number, this is how much time progresses or rather

57
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,400
how many radius progress per one period one cycle.

58
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,570
OK, so we know one cycle is going to be you two pi going from beginning to the end, OK?

59
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,050
So omega is defined as two pi over the period C, and we also discovered in the last video that one

60
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,490
or T one of the period.

61
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,190
That's basically the frequency, right?

62
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,010
So this is defined as two pi times frequency.

63
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,260
OK, so that's our angular frequency.

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,860
And what I what I want to point your attention to is a wave that's traveling in a positive direction

65
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,090
and the negative direction.

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Why is this guy traveling in the opposite direction?

67
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,970
The trick I like to use for figuring that out is to take any points.

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,850
It's got any point on the way we take this crest right here as it moves.

69
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,180
It's going to move only in the X direction, but.

70
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,190
If we want to describe this point as a muse after a time's up at sea, it might be over here.

71
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,300
We know that the theta is constant, right?

72
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:23,820
So for example, if we're trying to describe when F Vex equals zero at this point here, we know that

73
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,860
this is always occurs at an angle of two pot.

74
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,200
Right.

75
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:36,630
And it could be two multiples of two pirate two, and it lets you describe this, that this the angle

76
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,490
has three main thing is try the same exact point as it moves in the X direction.

77
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,960
So that means is that.

78
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:50,130
The angular term, which is described right here, omega seed has three main causes, so if we take

79
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,270
omega T.

80
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,630
Minus K X equals zero.

81
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,120
Right.

82
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,860
There's no no change.

83
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,230
What we can do is we can say, OK.

84
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,020
If it increases, we don't want any change in the sky, we want the Anglo angler part remain the same

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,070
and where the anger comes into play, sometimes we have a face constant.

86
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,860
So you could add a.

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,410
Little face constant, they're added, they're in this case, I'm thinking it to be zero.

88
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,430
That's our reference point.

89
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,510
But if we want to maintain that same point, right, this has to be true.

90
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,590
Um, so well, maybe it's the must equal access of time.

91
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,350
It's increasing.

92
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,660
You never go backwards in time.

93
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,130
And we want this to remain the same X as that increases.

94
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,230
As such.

95
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,120
Actually increases, and we see that this guy balances out because of these relationships here.

96
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:54,200
So in order for it to travel in the X direction, this guy must be zero.

97
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,560
This is positive that that works.

98
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,590
So this is truly an extraction because as as X increases and time increases.

99
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,530
We have no change in the angular displacement.

100
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,020
Now, if we want travel in the opposite direction, what we would have to do is we just change the sign

101
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,030
omega t plus.

102
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,360
OK.

103
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,180
And the reason why this works is because as time increases, acts as a function of time.

104
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,810
We find out if he's traveling in the negative direction.

105
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,170
X must decrease because if it's going this way.

106
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,200
It's going to decrease, so in the same sense, this negative term cancels out with that positive turn.

107
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,120
And we still have a constant value.

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,070
We still get that phase term right there.

109
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,210
OK, so that's how you can determine whether a wave travels in the right direction or the left direction.

110
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,750
OK.

111
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,750
And you might see this rate as let me make some more space here really fast for you guys.

112
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,970
You might see this term written a little bit differently, but I can show you that they're actually

113
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,540
equivalent.

114
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,570
So you might see it written as K acts.

115
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,190
Minus Omega T.

116
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:14,160
Some textbooks or if you do a search online and it's the same thing because as T increases.

117
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,000
X must increase in the right direction.

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,260
This guy is constant.

119
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,680
That's the trick I've always used for determining if a wave that I'm provided is going in the positive

120
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,740
direction or negative x direction, and I hope that makes sense for you guys.

121
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,760
So in this situation, when we're we're going to look at this.

122
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,070
Um.

123
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,610
It's going in the right direction and the observed entity, it's going to be in the positive right direction.

124
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,300
Awesome.

125
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,110
OK.

126
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,340
So one last key term, I want to go before we actually jump into the analysis.

127
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,720
It's got two options.

128
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,310
I'll go over briefly is.

129
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,680
Usually, we don't want to deal with a lot of cases and fines.

130
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,050
So we want to work with the real term, not the imaginary term, because if we remember from Euler's

131
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:11,640
identity e to the I X is equal to cosine x plus, I can sign X and I switched off the guy with a j here.

132
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,990
Usually, physics uses a j.

133
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,560
Mathematics uses an AI, but regardless what you use, it's going to the square root of negative one.

134
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,730
If we're dealing with real entities of physics, we had to take the real part all the oil or identity.

135
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,310
So this wave is usually expressed as eight times the cosine, which is the real part of this right.

136
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:37,810
The amplitude pops out and the cosine and then the angular term in here.

137
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,740
OK, so that's what we're going to use the analysis.

138
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,730
And one last thing I want to note is that if we take definitions of the frequency, the wavelength,

139
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,320
the angular frequency and the wave number, we can relate them.

140
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,820
And we're going to use that throughout our analysis.

141
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,750
Let's run through that.

142
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,180
We know previously that the frequency was defined as see over the wavelength.

143
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,660
OK.

144
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,010
And this seemed to work out in terms of units meters per second, divided by meters because you won

145
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,170
over a second, which is the units where the frequency if we take this term here.

146
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,840
And we plug in what we have for Lander, so we multiply the story to get a two pie arc to buy comes

147
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,410
down here, the cave flips up, we get a KC over two PI.

148
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,200
And if we note that to pie in the sky over a times, F is equal to a mega.

149
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,960
We can find that Casey is equal to Omega.

150
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,020
So that's a term which we can relate these two guys.

151
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,360
And it's going to help us pop this guy out in some of our analysis and get the result that we're trying

152
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,670
to look.

153
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,840
OK, so now what I want to do, you have some background, some understanding of traveling or propagating

154
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
ENM waves.

155
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,890
We're going to take that definition and just organically derive a Doppler shift by working through the

156
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,630
mathematics that are behind this.

157
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,900
Some textbooks take the approach that I took in the last video.

158
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,210
That's sort of an elementary approach.

159
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,780
More of a sophisticated, complex physics approach that you'll probably see at higher levels is the

160
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,010
approach I'm going to take here.

161
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,780
So let's delve into that and do that now.

162
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,500
OK.

163
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:18,500
So if we make use of the non relativistic relationship we derived in our first video, we are trying

164
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,170
to bridge the gap between two different perspectives of the same phenomenon.

165
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,180
What we found is that if you don't account for relativistic effects, we find that a moving reference

166
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:35,120
frame ex-prime can be related to a non-moving referencing X.

167
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,840
By the relative motion between them, we find that as prime is equal to X minus B T.

168
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,610
And we also found that there is no difference between the moving reference frames conception of time

169
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,850
and original ones, which is unlike what we saw with relativistic effects, where we observe time dilation,

170
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,850
where time sees the tick at a different rate.

171
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,160
OK, so we're ignoring those effects for now.

172
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,410
We'll jump into that in subsequent videos.

173
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,470
But if we just take these simple relationships and take what we've just discovered for propagating plane

174
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:15,770
waves, we can take f x see a wave that is a function of x A. We know that's defined as a cosine omega

175
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,060
T minus K X, and what we could do is we can just plop these guys straight.

176
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,020
So here we have a time to adjust changes to T Prime.

177
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,730
And here we have an X.

178
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:34,490
Well, we can take this and we can say OK, if we plus v t x is equal to x prime loss v t.

179
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,270
And you know, you could actually observe that pretty clearly.

180
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,850
Like if we have x y here and I show this in the video, it's confusing.

181
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,380
Jump back to the first few videos.

182
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,850
Of course we get x y if we have an x prime y prime.

183
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,590
That's moving in a positive direction.

184
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,200
Well, if you want to figure out X, you can take what X Prize is to this point here.

185
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,160
It's going to be there for there, plus the distance that has elapsed.

186
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:05,700
Right?

187
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,470
The same thing works for X Prize, right?

188
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:13,890
If you want prime, you can take the distance of this guy all the way from there with respect to X minus

189
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,450
the distance to travel there.

190
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,820
And then you would get that guy, which is just the measurement and the moving reference.

191
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,480
OK.

192
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,790
So we can use this stuff we get.

193
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:28,560
This relationship is universal conception of reality to make use of it, make use of it, right?

194
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,410
We invested all that time and writing this let's actually use it.

195
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:41,100
So if we plug in for x x prime plus b t right, we get the mega C prime minus K x prize plus beauty.

196
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,750
We use this relationship here.

197
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:50,100
And then if we distribute all these guys, we get omega t prime minus K v t prime.

198
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:59,090
Minus K X. Prime, and then we can group the terms sort of make use of some of the relationships we

199
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,200
have, right?

200
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,340
We can come back up here.

201
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,470
We say, Oh, we have a mega, we have an AK.

202
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,460
I want to group the TS so that we can find some relationship because we know from this definition here,

203
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,180
whatever is in front of a T is the frequency of our weight.

204
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,660
That's how it works.

205
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,600
That's what the angular frequency is defined as.

206
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,920
So if we try to get rid of the K, define it in terms of our original frequency.

207
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,900
We know that this relationship off here that we establish a mega is equal to Casey.

208
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,460
So if we divide by C, we know that K is equal to a mega over C.

209
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,650
We plop this guy in there and we end up with is a cosine times or negative line minus a mega tonnes

210
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,830
b over C.

211
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,130
Right?

212
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,020
We just plug this straight into here.

213
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:48,530
Put a mega receiver omega over C and then we see that we have a common omega and T prime between the

214
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,010
terms.

215
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,210
So we're not really interested in this guy, but we can just pull out straight ahead.

216
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,900
Now, Megan, to Prime Omega's prime, what are we left with?

217
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,070
One?

218
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,070
And an Omega tribe has VRC one minus B or C.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,240
That that's the result we're looking for, so if we take this literally a mathematical reduction of

220
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,120
everything we have been doing, what we can do is we could say OK, based upon that, based on our mathematics,

221
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,140
based upon our relationships, we found that just because of this relative motion, right?

222
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,830
The V between this guy and this guy.

223
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:33,520
That says that our apparent frequency, what we're supposed to observe in the wave is literally as follows.

224
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,170
It's really this parameter here.

225
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:43,450
So we get the observed frequency at omega prime equal to one minus B or C omega, which looks very similar

226
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,800
to the previous term.

227
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,150
We observed, right?

228
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,690
However, right.

229
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,710
That was in terms of the frequency, not the angular frequency.

230
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:57,880
So, you know, we know that this is just different by a parameter of one of two PI.

231
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:04,550
So if we take this guy multiply by one hour two pi, that is equal to f you multiply on the left, you

232
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:09,020
multiply on the right that maintains the equality and then omega two.

233
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,620
What about two?

234
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,840
Pi is no different than the frequency.

235
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,630
So mega primes becomes um.

236
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,760
F Prime.

237
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,490
Which I should make note of that the apparent observed frequency and that is just the quantity one minus

238
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,380
B or C times the original frequency.

239
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,930
And I know, wait a minute, you're thinking, what's going on here?

240
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,240
This is a different sign.

241
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,650
That's just because based upon how we derived all this stuff.

242
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:42,360
Our original derivation was assuming a V in the positive direction, positive direction when we derived

243
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,430
the previous one, the the V was in the opposite direction.

244
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,740
So the results are synonymous.

245
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,480
We've got the same exact result.

246
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,650
This if it's going in a positive direction, right?

247
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,900
We're adding that on top of the city, the the distance, the way it travels, that's traveled an extra

248
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,600
distance to get to that observed and that observer, right?

249
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:12,780
We get less crisp hitting that observer that results in less cycles completed per second, which he

250
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,870
observes or results in a lower frequency.

251
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,100
This is the result.

252
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,510
We expect this is the result.

253
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,060
We got the same as we previously had.

254
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,470
That strengthens our confidence.

255
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,770
That's awesome.

256
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,180
OK.

257
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,500
But but this was option number one we worked with, and it makes use of a previous result, which sort

258
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,330
of uses from relativity.

259
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,410
What we could do right is just purely by mathematical means.

260
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,030
I mean, pretty cool, right?

261
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,920
That would strengthen.

262
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,520
The validity of the argument and increase our confidence, so next, what we're going to do, we're

263
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,200
going to one more derivation.

264
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,370
Stick with me.

265
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,900
We're going to get the same result.

266
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,170
But doing it purely just by the physics, the math and what we've put up here.

267
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,340
Stay tuned.
