### Đoạn 1

All right. And our last video, we had our first encounter with a concept known as a Doppler shift. What do we find in that video? We discovered that any kind of relative motion, whether it's closing the gap or opening the gap between

### Đoạn 2

a source, an observer of any kind of waveform experiences, a change, a relative shift in that frequency, and it's due to the relative motion between that observer and the source. OK, so what the helped us do? It helped us extend our universal conception of reality such that we could further bridge the gap between

### Đoạn 3

different perspectives and get a nice, all inclusive perspective of the universe. Now what I want to do in this video is take another look, another perspective of that same phenomenon and derive the same exact result. But this time, instead of taking a physical approach by using our physical observation and understanding

### Đoạn 4

of the phenomenon at hand, what I want to do is take a more organic mathematical approach by taking a look at ENM waves. That's electro and magnetism waves. OK.

### Đoạn 5

So in order to do that first, what I want to do is I want to review what happens with the traveling, propagating wave, and I want to use that information and some, some input we had in the beginning of this course for the non relativistic shift between different perspectives. We're going to use that to derive the same result to strengthen what we obtained and increase our confidence

### Đoạn 6

in that result. OK. So first and foremost, traveling waves, OK? We're going to we're going to go over the key characteristics of sir.

### Đoạn 7

So any kind of traveling way of what we have is just like we saw previously in the last video on some function, which the function of X and time this is at time equals zero. The independent variable is X. When you have a source that emits wave, it's going to go up and down in a cyclical fashion.

### Đoạn 8

It's going to have an amplitude, a that's going to be the maximum point of the crest and the travel and one is propagating. We know that the wave moves in the right direction. Now you study physics before, maybe also to throw away phenomenon some kind of stuff like that.

### Đoạn 9

What you find is that we can describe this wave mathematically in two ways. First. What we can do is we can use the Euler identity to describe in terms of cool signs and signs that function, which is the function of X and T, usually describe as the amplitude.

### Đoạn 10

And this exponential function with J. We're J is the square root of negative one. An imaginary number times the quantity omega T minus K X. This representation. Is intended to describe a wave of travels in the X direction, and I'm going to go over the difference

### Đoạn 11

between traveling in the X direction and traveling in the negative X direction because they are a little different. And that's going to drive what we talk about in this lesson here. First and foremost, what in the world is so mega?

### Đoạn 12

And one, the world is this Kater? And he studied the stuff previously. You've probably found that K, which is the propagation constant or the wave number. It describes how many radians are transpired per each wavelength of our waves.

### Đoạn 13

The wave ones, as we described previously, is once like one complete cycle that wave. And it's generally defined as K is equal to two pi over land at the wavelength. That's the wave number. We're trying to figure out how the angle changes with respect to one one wavelength.

### Đoạn 14

Right? It's in terms of distance. We also have omega, which is the angular frequency. So conversely, to the propagation concept with wave number, this is how much time progresses or rather

### Đoạn 15

how many radius progress per one period one cycle. OK, so we know one cycle is going to be you two pi going from beginning to the end, OK? So omega is defined as two pi over the period C, and we also discovered in the last video that one or T one of the period.

### Đoạn 16

That's basically the frequency, right? So this is defined as two pi times frequency. OK, so that's our angular frequency. And what I what I want to point your attention to is a wave that's traveling in a positive direction

### Đoạn 17

and the negative direction. Why is this guy traveling in the opposite direction? The trick I like to use for figuring that out is to take any points. It's got any point on the way we take this crest right here as it moves.

### Đoạn 18

It's going to move only in the X direction, but. If we want to describe this point as a muse after a time's up at sea, it might be over here. We know that the theta is constant, right? So for example, if we're trying to describe when F Vex equals zero at this point here, we know that

### Đoạn 19

this is always occurs at an angle of two pot. Right. And it could be two multiples of two pirate two, and it lets you describe this, that this the angle has three main thing is try the same exact point as it moves in the X direction.

### Đoạn 20

So that means is that. The angular term, which is described right here, omega seed has three main causes, so if we take omega T. Minus K X equals zero.

### Đoạn 21

Right. There's no no change. What we can do is we can say, OK. If it increases, we don't want any change in the sky, we want the Anglo angler part remain the same

### Đoạn 22

and where the anger comes into play, sometimes we have a face constant. So you could add a. Little face constant, they're added, they're in this case, I'm thinking it to be zero. That's our reference point.

### Đoạn 23

But if we want to maintain that same point, right, this has to be true. Um, so well, maybe it's the must equal access of time. It's increasing. You never go backwards in time.

### Đoạn 24

And we want this to remain the same X as that increases. As such. Actually increases, and we see that this guy balances out because of these relationships here. So in order for it to travel in the X direction, this guy must be zero.

### Đoạn 25

This is positive that that works. So this is truly an extraction because as as X increases and time increases. We have no change in the angular displacement. Now, if we want travel in the opposite direction, what we would have to do is we just change the sign

### Đoạn 26

omega t plus. OK. And the reason why this works is because as time increases, acts as a function of time. We find out if he's traveling in the negative direction.

### Đoạn 27

X must decrease because if it's going this way. It's going to decrease, so in the same sense, this negative term cancels out with that positive turn. And we still have a constant value. We still get that phase term right there.

### Đoạn 28

OK, so that's how you can determine whether a wave travels in the right direction or the left direction. OK. And you might see this rate as let me make some more space here really fast for you guys. You might see this term written a little bit differently, but I can show you that they're actually

### Đoạn 29

equivalent. So you might see it written as K acts. Minus Omega T. Some textbooks or if you do a search online and it's the same thing because as T increases.

### Đoạn 30

X must increase in the right direction. This guy is constant. That's the trick I've always used for determining if a wave that I'm provided is going in the positive direction or negative x direction, and I hope that makes sense for you guys.

### Đoạn 31

So in this situation, when we're we're going to look at this. Um. It's going in the right direction and the observed entity, it's going to be in the positive right direction. Awesome.

### Đoạn 32

OK. So one last key term, I want to go before we actually jump into the analysis. It's got two options. I'll go over briefly is.

### Đoạn 33

Usually, we don't want to deal with a lot of cases and fines. So we want to work with the real term, not the imaginary term, because if we remember from Euler's identity e to the I X is equal to cosine x plus, I can sign X and I switched off the guy with a j here. Usually, physics uses a j.

### Đoạn 34

Mathematics uses an AI, but regardless what you use, it's going to the square root of negative one. If we're dealing with real entities of physics, we had to take the real part all the oil or identity. So this wave is usually expressed as eight times the cosine, which is the real part of this right. The amplitude pops out and the cosine and then the angular term in here.

### Đoạn 35

OK, so that's what we're going to use the analysis. And one last thing I want to note is that if we take definitions of the frequency, the wavelength, the angular frequency and the wave number, we can relate them. And we're going to use that throughout our analysis.

### Đoạn 36

Let's run through that. We know previously that the frequency was defined as see over the wavelength. OK. And this seemed to work out in terms of units meters per second, divided by meters because you won

### Đoạn 37

over a second, which is the units where the frequency if we take this term here. And we plug in what we have for Lander, so we multiply the story to get a two pie arc to buy comes down here, the cave flips up, we get a KC over two PI. And if we note that to pie in the sky over a times, F is equal to a mega.

### Đoạn 38

We can find that Casey is equal to Omega. So that's a term which we can relate these two guys. And it's going to help us pop this guy out in some of our analysis and get the result that we're trying to look.

### Đoạn 39

OK, so now what I want to do, you have some background, some understanding of traveling or propagating ENM waves. We're going to take that definition and just organically derive a Doppler shift by working through the mathematics that are behind this.

### Đoạn 40

Some textbooks take the approach that I took in the last video. That's sort of an elementary approach. More of a sophisticated, complex physics approach that you'll probably see at higher levels is the approach I'm going to take here.

### Đoạn 41

So let's delve into that and do that now. OK. So if we make use of the non relativistic relationship we derived in our first video, we are trying to bridge the gap between two different perspectives of the same phenomenon.

### Đoạn 42

What we found is that if you don't account for relativistic effects, we find that a moving reference frame ex-prime can be related to a non-moving referencing X. By the relative motion between them, we find that as prime is equal to X minus B T. And we also found that there is no difference between the moving reference frames conception of time

### Đoạn 43

and original ones, which is unlike what we saw with relativistic effects, where we observe time dilation, where time sees the tick at a different rate. OK, so we're ignoring those effects for now. We'll jump into that in subsequent videos.

### Đoạn 44

But if we just take these simple relationships and take what we've just discovered for propagating plane waves, we can take f x see a wave that is a function of x A. We know that's defined as a cosine omega T minus K X, and what we could do is we can just plop these guys straight. So here we have a time to adjust changes to T Prime.

### Đoạn 45

And here we have an X. Well, we can take this and we can say OK, if we plus v t x is equal to x prime loss v t. And you know, you could actually observe that pretty clearly. Like if we have x y here and I show this in the video, it's confusing.

### Đoạn 46

Jump back to the first few videos. Of course we get x y if we have an x prime y prime. That's moving in a positive direction. Well, if you want to figure out X, you can take what X Prize is to this point here.

### Đoạn 47

It's going to be there for there, plus the distance that has elapsed. Right? The same thing works for X Prize, right? If you want prime, you can take the distance of this guy all the way from there with respect to X minus

### Đoạn 48

the distance to travel there. And then you would get that guy, which is just the measurement and the moving reference. OK. So we can use this stuff we get.

### Đoạn 49

This relationship is universal conception of reality to make use of it, make use of it, right? We invested all that time and writing this let's actually use it. So if we plug in for x x prime plus b t right, we get the mega C prime minus K x prize plus beauty. We use this relationship here.

### Đoạn 50

And then if we distribute all these guys, we get omega t prime minus K v t prime. Minus K X. Prime, and then we can group the terms sort of make use of some of the relationships we have, right? We can come back up here.

### Đoạn 51

We say, Oh, we have a mega, we have an AK. I want to group the TS so that we can find some relationship because we know from this definition here, whatever is in front of a T is the frequency of our weight. That's how it works.

### Đoạn 52

That's what the angular frequency is defined as. So if we try to get rid of the K, define it in terms of our original frequency. We know that this relationship off here that we establish a mega is equal to Casey. So if we divide by C, we know that K is equal to a mega over C.

### Đoạn 53

We plop this guy in there and we end up with is a cosine times or negative line minus a mega tonnes b over C. Right? We just plug this straight into here.

### Đoạn 54

Put a mega receiver omega over C and then we see that we have a common omega and T prime between the terms. So we're not really interested in this guy, but we can just pull out straight ahead. Now, Megan, to Prime Omega's prime, what are we left with?

### Đoạn 55

One? And an Omega tribe has VRC one minus B or C. That that's the result we're looking for, so if we take this literally a mathematical reduction of everything we have been doing, what we can do is we could say OK, based upon that, based on our mathematics,

### Đoạn 56

based upon our relationships, we found that just because of this relative motion, right? The V between this guy and this guy. That says that our apparent frequency, what we're supposed to observe in the wave is literally as follows. It's really this parameter here.

### Đoạn 57

So we get the observed frequency at omega prime equal to one minus B or C omega, which looks very similar to the previous term. We observed, right? However, right.

### Đoạn 58

That was in terms of the frequency, not the angular frequency. So, you know, we know that this is just different by a parameter of one of two PI. So if we take this guy multiply by one hour two pi, that is equal to f you multiply on the left, you multiply on the right that maintains the equality and then omega two.

### Đoạn 59

What about two? Pi is no different than the frequency. So mega primes becomes um. F Prime.

### Đoạn 60

Which I should make note of that the apparent observed frequency and that is just the quantity one minus B or C times the original frequency. And I know, wait a minute, you're thinking, what's going on here? This is a different sign.

### Đoạn 61

That's just because based upon how we derived all this stuff. Our original derivation was assuming a V in the positive direction, positive direction when we derived the previous one, the the V was in the opposite direction. So the results are synonymous.

### Đoạn 62

We've got the same exact result. This if it's going in a positive direction, right? We're adding that on top of the city, the the distance, the way it travels, that's traveled an extra distance to get to that observed and that observer, right?

### Đoạn 63

We get less crisp hitting that observer that results in less cycles completed per second, which he observes or results in a lower frequency. This is the result. We expect this is the result.

### Đoạn 64

We got the same as we previously had. That strengthens our confidence. That's awesome. OK.

### Đoạn 65

But but this was option number one we worked with, and it makes use of a previous result, which sort of uses from relativity. What we could do right is just purely by mathematical means. I mean, pretty cool, right?

### Đoạn 66

That would strengthen. The validity of the argument and increase our confidence, so next, what we're going to do, we're going to one more derivation. Stick with me.

### Đoạn 67

We're going to get the same result. But doing it purely just by the physics, the math and what we've put up here. Stay tuned.
