1
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.130
All right, in our last topic, we derived the notion of a relativistic Doppler shift, and in doing

2
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.950
so, that allowed us to get more accurate results.

3
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
But we did pay a small price, as you can tell through the equation right here.

4
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.690
It's much more convoluted than the initial approach we use for calculating Doppler shifts, but it will

5
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.100
give us more accuracy.

6
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.210
Now in that video, what I notice is that at least for Doppler or rather radar applications with the

7
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.330
Doppler shift, a lot of manmade targets are not traveling close to the speed of light.

8
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.780
So as a result of that, we do not necessarily have to use the relativistic Doppler shift.

9
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.890
And I know what you're thinking.

10
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.810
You're probably thinking, Wait a minute, why don't we spend all that time and effort driving this

11
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.340
more accurate approach?

12
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.060
If for radar applications, we could just use the easier simplified version of the Doppler shift?

13
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.890
What's going on here?

14
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.800
Why do we do this?

15
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.480
And there is a method to my madness because what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to show

16
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.300
you how we can take the relativistic Doppler shift and how it can provide some useful information in

17
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.380
different applications.

18
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.080
The application were to take a look at in this particular video is known as a redshift, and this pops

19
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.330
up in astrophysics and in particular cosmology, which is sort of like the study of the universe.

20
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.250
In particular, we're going to look into is, does the universe expand?

21
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.250
Is it static?

22
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.540
What's going on?

23
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.040
What kind of ideas can support or disprove the Big Bang Theory that we sort of take for granted nowadays?

24
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.090
These are the different topics I'm going to discuss in this video.

25
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.500
Before we do that, we need to take a look at line spectra.

26
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.780
Now, as we talked about with Doppler shifts, what's going on is the frequency is being changed based

27
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.750
upon the distance that the light has to travel.

28
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.380
So what you can do is if we're studying, let's say, galaxies, stars or other cosmological or astrophysical

29
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.540
objects, what we can do is we could take a look at the light spectrum that is being transmitted from

30
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.180
that star.

31
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.680
OK, so I have written right here the first part of the board when light is emitted from the core of

32
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.220
a star.

33
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.850
What happens is certain wavelengths or colors are absorbed by specific atoms.

34
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.250
OK, so when the light is created at the core of the Sun, they're going to be different and particularly

35
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.540
hydrogen, for example, that are going to absorb that light.

36
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.370
And when we receive the whole spectrum of that light, certain frequencies and wavelengths are going

37
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.440
to be missing, which correspond to certain colors that were absorbed by atoms.

38
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.770
Now this begs the question why does that happen while these atoms are absorbing that light?

39
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.340
And those frequencies?

40
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:18.000
Because as we learned quantum physics, electrons and atoms, hydrogen, for example, they absorb quantized

41
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.410
or fixed amounts of energy when they get excited and jump to the next level that they're actually traveling

42
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.250
or exhibiting it.

43
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.710
So when those electrons jump in, absorb those lights, it's always going to be the same amount of energy.

44
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.050
And as we're going to learn in the next section, that's the amount of energy is tied to the frequency.

45
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.460
So certain colors, wavelength frequencies are going to be absorbed and they're going to be missing

46
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.890
from the line spectrum that we analyze.

47
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.960
OK, so go to the next part.

48
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.620
This usually results in absorption or Fraunhofer lines, and Fraunhofer was the individual who actually

49
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.480
identified this phenomenon first.

50
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.300
But it results in those lines in the star's measured light spectrum.

51
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.880
So we're going to get these blank missing lines in the spectrum and a spectrum, if you've never seen

52
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.510
that before.

53
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.570
Basically, I sort of have a limitation right here where you can plot up the different colors at different

54
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.790
wavelengths, where the wavelength is the x axis and you know, you're going to at different wavelengths,

55
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.100
you're going to have different colors.

56
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.790
So when we have these absorption lines, we're going to have a blank missing portion.

57
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:34.400
And regardless of where this takes place, you would expect, you know, if a star has just hydrogen,

58
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.810
that probably wouldn't happen.

59
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.170
But if we're taking a look at hydrogen, we would expect a star at this point in the star at this place

60
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.740
at the same kind of absorption.

61
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.970
So we expect that Black Line always to be at the same place when we look at any kind of expects spectrum.

62
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.920
So next, comparing these absorption lines to line spectra of the same atoms measured in a lab in a

63
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:05.270
stationary lab setting, we can find that the absorption lines have shifted a wavelength or frame.

64
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.480
So what's going to happen is you start looking at these, this light in these spectra that are coming

65
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.720
in.

66
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.620
And if you compare that to the same experiment, right, you take an atom.

67
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.000
What you would expect their line to be their line spectra and you compare the two.

68
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.770
We see that this this absorption line has shifted.

69
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.060
Now we know that atoms are always going to store the same amount of frequency.

70
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.840
So what we can deduce and is the point of this video is that the difference in the wavelength so I have

71
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.460
a before and after right here.

72
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.500
So, you know, maybe hydrogen has I think it's hydrogen gamma, which absorbs a blue light at a certain

73
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.010
wavelength, if that's shifted by this delta lambda.

74
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.720
What does that mean?

75
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.120
That means it must be a Doppler shift.

76
00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.820
And if a star is moving away from us, what does that mean?

77
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.440
It means that the distance between us and the star are getting larger, which means that the light has

78
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.720
to travel or travel a larger distance.

79
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.870
That's the idea of a Doppler shift that we talked about.

80
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.740
So the wavelength is going to increase and the frequency is going to decrease.

81
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.490
OK.

82
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.600
So what happens?

83
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.730
We know that red colors.

84
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.070
Occur at higher wavelengths of the wavelength that's going to increase as described by this equation

85
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.340
here.

86
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.930
I spent a lot of time driving that.

87
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:38.310
We're going to see a shift in that wavelength from blue bluer colors to red, and I don't have a lot

88
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.440
of markers of this sort of a simplified drawing.

89
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:48.060
But if it's moving away, if it's receding, you get what is known as a shift red direction and that's

90
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.850
called a red shift.

91
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.980
That's what we call a red shift a red shift to higher wavelengths, right?

92
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.350
So you can deduce that the star perhaps is receding or moving away from us.

93
00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.920
OK.

94
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:04.320
Conversely, if something is moving towards you, the distance is getting smaller.

95
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:12.120
So the crests and the the the travels, they're going to hit you more frequently, which means that

96
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.520
your frequency jumps up, but your wavelength jumps down.

97
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.560
So that's the opposite effect, right?

98
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:26.280
So if we had something like this and we have the star lights emitting the light, moving closer to us

99
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.600
compared to the same atom absorbing the lights on Earth.

100
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.440
We're going to get what is known as a blue shift, OK?

101
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.460
In other words, the wave is going to decrease, the frequency is going to blow up and we go from a

102
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.630
red color to a blue color.

103
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:48.890
OK, so that's all the names mean red shift and blue shift try to signify what what direction the Doppler

104
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.540
shift actually occurs.

105
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.660
And in order to make sense of this, we have another mathematical term that tries to describe this.

106
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:05.480
So I'm going to derive both of these these red shifts in terms of relativistic quantities and non relativistic

107
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.170
quantities.

108
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:13.010
So for the relativistic redshift, what we're interested in is the change in this wavelength respect

109
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.560
to the original wavelength that was sent out.

110
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.940
So we describe that as a parameter z you're going to see in the literature.

111
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:27.680
It's described as the Doppler shift in wavelength lambda prime minus the original emitted wavelength

112
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.040
lambda.

113
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.770
Not over lambda, not OK.

114
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:38.810
So if we take our Doppler shift in a relativistic situation, which we derive right here, we plop this

115
00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.400
guy in here and do some some work massage his equation a bit.

116
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.020
What we find is that right?

117
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:50.480
We got these two radicals one plus v rollover C divided by one minus the radical V relative.

118
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.540
Oversee all that under our square root.

119
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:59.290
Last, we multiplied by the original wavelength and we subtract the original wavelength.

120
00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:03.500
What we do is we come in here, we say, Oh, wait a second, we got this.

121
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.380
This guy cancels with that, it cancels with that.

122
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.890
And what we end up with is basically all the turns with these radicals right here, it's preserved minus

123
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.490
one.

124
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.210
Now it doesn't look as nice.

125
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:22.220
So what you sometimes see in a lecture is you get this one plus c equal to basically all the math you

126
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.290
have to do to sort of simplify it a bit.

127
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.380
But what can we do with this equation?

128
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.220
Why is this?

129
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:34.340
Why is this useful and why did astronomers and astrophysicists actually derive this?

130
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.130
Well, in order to understand that we need to look at two situations, we can know that after we calculate

131
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:40.710
Z.

132
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:50.990
If Z is greater than zero, if it's positive, that means that the delta, it means that this guy was

133
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.300
larger than that, which means we red shifted, right?

134
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:54.530
You can see that right here.

135
00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.920
If this is positive, if it's greater than zero, it means that compared to our original wavelength

136
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:02.870
right, we increased right.

137
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.910
So it's sort of like a relative comparison and helps you make quick analytical decisions.

138
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.260
That's why it's useful.

139
00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.060
So I fear for z greater than zero.

140
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.160
The object has a receding velocity, which is going away from the observer.

141
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:20.950
In other words, the star galaxy, whatever kind of astronomical object you want to talk about, food

142
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.290
is getting further and further away from us, OK?

143
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.210
So that's what we have here.

144
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.950
But if Z is less than zero to the negative number, that's the opposite.

145
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:36.260
That means that this guy got smaller than the original wavelength that delta is negative.

146
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.730
As a result of that, we can deduce that the object, the star, whatever its root, is moving closer

147
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.420
to us, OK?

148
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:51.050
So it's the opposite effect, and the find really governs the analytical phenomena that's arising right

149
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:51.740
in front of our eyes.

150
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:58.610
Now we see this and I said previously, you know, relativistic Doppler shifts, you know, the math

151
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.120
is not nice.

152
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.200
We have these two radicals.

153
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.280
It's not super nice.

154
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.360
So if we're dealing with slow moving objects, which, uh, sometimes is the case, not as often the

155
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.140
astrophysics.

156
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.910
That's why we're saying this, right?

157
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.770
I'm trying to say that relativistic double shifts do have some kind of use, but if we're looking at

158
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:21.500
an object that's moving away or coming closer at a very slow speed, what we can do is we can have a

159
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.360
non relativistic redshift.

160
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.550
And in essence, we just do the same thing.

161
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:30.350
So I'm going to run through that really quickly and show how can drastically simplify the math, make

162
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.910
your life easier.

163
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.280
OK, so we have the same kind of approach.

164
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:41.030
We take the Doppler shifted wavelength line to prime, minus the original land and not over land and

165
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.360
not.

166
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.310
And that is approximately equal to the following well, if you recall previously.

167
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:55.770
We derived equation where it was like the frequency, if not over one minus the relevancy.

168
00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.400
And to give you an idea of what I'm doing here.

169
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:05.430
The speed of light we know is equal to lambda times the frequency, right?

170
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:07.140
That's what we found in a previous video.

171
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:13.500
So taking the frequency equations we derived and also for what I have up here, we could translate it

172
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.440
into a wavelength form by simply doing the following.

173
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:22.110
We could just take C over a blank is equal to lambda.

174
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.540
So all we need to do is invert that equation.

175
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:29.910
Multiply by C the CS cancel because we have an f prime on the left and f prime on the right.

176
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:37.080
And we end up with the result we want, so originally, I believe we had an equation, something like

177
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.980
ethanol over one plus zero or 2C.

178
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.290
So you just flip it over and you get the equation you're looking for.

179
00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.390
That's where this guy came from.

180
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.260
But we had that probably the first or second video.

181
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.350
Of the series, and we work through the math, we find that, you know, guess what?

182
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:05.030
Again, this original source guy drops out on both terms.

183
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:15.130
We get this one plus the relevancy minus one the one cancels and we just get nice, nice little high

184
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:15.670
result.

185
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:24.530
Right here made note that, yes, this is only valid when the relative velocity is much less than.
