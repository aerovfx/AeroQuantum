1
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.740
All right.

2
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.240
In the beginning of this course, we've been trying to put together this nice universal conception of

3
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.300
reality, one which bridges the gap between different perspectives of reality.

4
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.840
And in doing so, what we were able to do, we're able to erect that bridge such that people have different

5
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.150
information coming in with different perspectives, if you will, can communicate with each other and

6
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.550
sync up on the events that they observe.

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.900
Now what I want to do is strengthen and fortify that bridge so that it's more solidified and more applicable

8
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.620
to the phenomena that is occurring and arising within reality.

9
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.630
What we're going to do is we're going to take a look at another phenomenon that crops up again and again

10
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.440
and relativity.

11
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.410
This is known as the Doppler shift.

12
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.780
Initially, we're going to take a look at the non relativistic Doppler shift to review what goes on

13
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.950
in that just in case you have not observed it before, you have not encountered this in physics.

14
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.610
And then we're going to build off of that, that nice foundation to account for relativity and see how

15
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.110
relativistic effects are going to change the observed Doppler shift.

16
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.100
OK.

17
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.920
But in the beginning of the course, when I started talking about this, I said I was initially interested

18
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.340
in started studying relativity again because I was looking at a lot of radar stuff, which actually

19
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.090
makes a lot of use of Doppler shifts in order to observe the velocity and measure the velocity of different

20
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.430
targets that we're trying to detect and observe in reality, whether that be with a missile defense

21
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.000
system or whether that be with cops trying to figure out the speed of a driver, or if your own car

22
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.580
is trying to measure the velocity of a car in front of you, how it's slowly dwindling and using that

23
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.600
for cruise control.

24
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.740
OK, so what we're going to do first before we actually delve into the actual physics is I want to take

25
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.990
a step back and review some key characteristics that are going to crop up again and again throughout

26
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.680
this analysis.

27
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.360
In this video, what am I talking about?

28
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.480
We must understand the physics and the under pinning of waves.

29
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.300
OK, because Doppler shifts as we're going to find out, it's a shift in frequency of apparent waves,

30
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.940
whether that be sound light.

31
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.380
It can occur in ocean waves if you have, you know, a surfer moving with waves, his apparent conception

32
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.780
of the occurrence of those waves.

33
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.760
The intervals between them is going to change best based upon its relative motion.

34
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.850
His alternate perspective, if you will.

35
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.650
So it's important to understand ways.

36
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.250
It's important to understand how we describe him and the different parameters that are used to do so.

37
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.760
So let's just provide a brief overview of that.

38
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.560
I know if you've seen this before, feel free to skip ahead, but I greatly encourage going through

39
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.300
this overview because I'm going to make reference to these terms and some equations in the duration

40
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.370
of the non relativistic Doppler shift.

41
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.850
OK.

42
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.950
So what I have here is a very simple picture of a sine wave.

43
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.210
All right, it goes up.

44
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.890
It's second nature.

45
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.830
We have crests at the maximum points and we have trowels at the minimum.

46
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.190
These are the extreme of the wave, if you will.

47
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.560
OK, so it operates in a sequential fashion because up to a positive value, a negative value, so on

48
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.980
and so forth indefinitely until it gets to the end.

49
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.290
Now, one important parameter that we're going to observe in Doppler, yes, is something known as a

50
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.820
wave length.

51
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.470
As the name implies, we break it down, it's the length of the wave.

52
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.060
So this is the total distance, the exact distance, the length it takes to complete one cycle of a

53
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.360
wave.

54
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.490
So as we show here depicted in the picture, the wavelength, which usually has a symbol of a lambda,

55
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.130
is from the beginning here over to the end.

56
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.820
There you see as one complete cycle and it continually repeats.

57
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.110
So this is the two wavelengths that will be three wavelength in total.

58
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.750
Now, if you any any kind of wave and we're dealing with radar, what you're going to see is we're going

59
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.190
to emit the wave and then it's going to be received at a target at an end.

60
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.780
Or maybe it could be an antenna if we're talking about some kind of communication system.

61
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.330
In that case, you can signify the total length of your wave train, if you will.

62
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.060
In essence, that's just the beginning to the end.

63
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.780
The total length so I have here the length of light wave train and I define it as and the number of

64
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:49.680
waves emitted or number of wavelength times the speed of light see times the total time transmits.

65
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.150
So if we take a look at this in terms of the units, we can see the speed which is meters per second

66
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.220
times, time seconds.

67
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.050
That gives us the light that gives us meters.

68
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.860
So in essence, all I'm doing is I'm doing basic kinematics, right?

69
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.280
We have Delta X is equal to the Delta T.

70
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:17.610
OK, so that can give us the total length from the beginning, the trends.

71
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.120
Additions to the receival receive all of our weight.

72
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.320
OK, so I've pure and total no human waste or as A..

73
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.490
We're going to have capital see that's going to represent the elapsed time of serve from this source

74
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.930
to the receiver.

75
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:39.290
And we also have another parameter which is going to be changing in the Doppler shift.

76
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.250
This is known as the frequency F, and this is how frequent we complete one cycle.

77
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.000
So the basic definition is how many cycles per second.

78
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.100
So that's going to be how many of these wavelengths can you fit in a second?

79
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.790
OK.

80
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.130
So you can also relate this to the wavelength by taking the speed of light divided by lambda.

81
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:10.040
And if you just take units again, it's meters per second for speed, divided by meters for the wavelength.

82
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.040
That gives you one of our second a cycle per second.

83
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.490
Right?

84
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.480
Because the cycle.

85
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.650
Is for one wavelength.

86
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.580
Right?

87
00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.280
So we have those important parameters, and I'm going to make use of them quite extensively in our derivation,

88
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.060
both with the physical intuition based portion of this.

89
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:33.090
And I'm also going to report repeat the derivation using electromagnetic waves to show you how it just

90
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.890
literally drops out of the mathematics.

91
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.460
But I want you to keep in the back of your mind this definition of frequency and wavelength.

92
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.710
And one more thing.

93
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:44.100
All right.

94
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.640
I told you and can be related to the time the period.

95
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.780
We can also specified in terms of the frequency.

96
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.860
So a frequency specifies how many cycles per second.

97
00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.890
If you multiply that by time, you get the number of cycles, which would be the number of one wavelength,

98
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.640
the total number of emitted waves.

99
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.990
OK.

100
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.180
So you can have these different definitions here, and we're going to make use of them in our derivation

101
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.590
heading forward.

102
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:11.460
All right.

103
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:18.030
Next, what I want to do is I want to take some time not doing any computations, not doing any calculations,

104
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.190
but trying to make you feel comfortable with the physical understanding.

105
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:28.350
I want to build physical intuition in terms of what is this Doppler shift before we actually delve into

106
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.570
what's going on, because if you understand it physically, you can write down the math and physics

107
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.970
pretty quickly and pretty effortlessly.

108
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.200
OK, so let's try to get a grip on what's going on in a Doppler shift.

109
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.300
To do that, I'm going to talk about the formal definition fresh.

110
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.090
So formally, in terms of words, what a Doppler shift is.

111
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:52.200
It's the apparent apparent change in the frequency EF.

112
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.660
Look at that length of a wave caused by relative motion.

113
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.150
This is where relativity pops them between the source of a wave and the observer.

114
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.670
So in other words, it means that you can have some source that's either moving or stationary.

115
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:13.900
In the case of radar, we have a stationary source that's shooting our beams, shooting out waves.

116
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:19.260
You have relative motion of some kind of guy coming in, so you send out the waves.

117
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.080
Initially, if you send out the wave and your receiver was still, you would get the same frequency,

118
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.350
right?

119
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.170
Basically, nothing is changing in the wave.

120
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.790
You get the same exact wavelength every second that would give you the same frequency.

121
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:40.740
But if the observer is moving, what's going to happen is he's going to see as the wave front comes

122
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.860
towards him and he's moving, he's going to see more waves encountered as he flies through it.

123
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.760
OK.

124
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.580
So talking about that, that's exactly what's going on, but it's easier to understand it if we take

125
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.310
a look at it graphically and to do so, what we're going to do.

126
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.680
We're going to take Terrance and Phillip again.

127
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.670
They're going to do an experiment.

128
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.380
They're going to say, Hey, guys, we discovered this awesome idea of our time dilation.

129
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.150
We've done all these experiments and we bridged the gap between relativity.

130
00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.640
Let's see if any other interesting phenomena pops up.

131
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.200
So we're going to have Terence.

132
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.050
He's going to be operating at a radar station at time.

133
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.980
T equals zero.

134
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.460
And he's going to hit a button that's going to transmit some waves.

135
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:25.950
We're going to have Philip, who's on this plane, is going to say, I'm going to look at it initially,

136
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:32.100
measure that frequency and then I start wines playing towards the radar and see what happens.

137
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.750
So when he sits stationary at time, T equals zero.

138
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.670
You know, he's going to see the apparent wave that was transmitted by Terence.

139
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.780
So that happens.

140
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.260
He calls out.

141
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.960
He's like, Yo bro, I got the same frequency.

142
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.300
This is exactly what we expected.

143
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:48.990
We're awesome.

144
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.180
So he gets that that no.

145
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.890
And then he wants to do another experiment.

146
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.660
OK, so next, what's going to happen is going to continue transmitting these waves and it's going to

147
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.760
fly towards the radar station.

148
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.220
And what I have depicted here shows the essence of the Doppler shift.

149
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:11.430
So what's going to happen is that if we take a time interval, Delta T between two equals zero and T

150
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.360
equal Delta T.

151
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.840
What you're going to find happening is the waves.

152
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.900
If you have light, we're going to travel at this speed.

153
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:24.060
See right, 3.8 times, three times 10 to the eight meters per second, right?

154
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.130
That's just the speed of light.

155
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.260
So that's how long it's going to take a fly out.

156
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.030
That's the speed it's going to be transmitted.

157
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.940
That's now when Philip flies towards the radar with a velocity of V.

158
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.200
What you're going to find is that after time, Delta T the wave traveled.

159
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.550
Seek out the T.

160
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.230
A fill up decrease, the distance between the wave and his plane by B Delta T.

161
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:54.060
OK, so he's going to fly in and that decreases the distance the wave has to travel.

162
00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:00.060
So what that means is instead of having to travel this distance, the wave now has to travel that smaller

163
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:00.630
distance.

164
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.100
At the same velocity.

165
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.790
Right.

166
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:08.820
So if we have Delta X is equal to u v Delta T.

167
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.660
And the is smaller and the B is constant.

168
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:22.700
Delta TSB smaller, so that means that if it takes a smaller Delta T to hit the plane, that means you're

169
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:28.880
going to see more ways hitting it, which would mean you think the frequency or the cycles per second

170
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.580
would increase for that different reference frame.

171
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:39.560
So it's going to observe a different phenomenon than what the stationary observer Terence actually observes.

172
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.770
OK, so Theresa Philip, they do that.

173
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:49.650
And Philip, is why he's freaking out here on the plane is like, Oh my God, man, I observe different

174
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:50.310
frequency.

175
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.980
So this is one way to observe it.

176
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:57.980
Another way to observe it is to take a look at what happens with sound waves.

177
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:04.140
Now, I think the most classic example of Doppler shifts that you experience on a day to day basis is

178
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:10.980
I want you to recall back to a time when you saw an ambulance like charging down the street.

179
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:18.090
So if you're standing on a street and it whizzes by you initially when it comes, you hear a pitch change,

180
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:18.230
right?

181
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.950
It goes you.

182
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.040
That change in pitch is exactly the Doppler shift.

183
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.530
Same exact phenomenon that's going on here.

184
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:38.190
So what's happening is when it's flying toward you with that speed V. It's emitting a wave every x seconds.

185
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.910
But initially, if it were still standing still, if you like to.

186
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:50.600
Now what's going on here is what they do and the the distance between those waves is decreased by fidelity,

187
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.180
just like what happened with Terrance and Phillip.

188
00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:00.890
So as a result of that decreased distance, that the distance between the amount of weight changes now

189
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.780
when it whizzes by the pitch also changes because it's coming back.

190
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.920
So every time it emits a wave, it has traveled bwt.

191
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:17.690
So it has to go see the ability plus fidelity, which is an extra distance which lengthens this wavelength

192
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:17.980
right?

193
00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:22.790
So these little red lines here signify the crest.

194
00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.570
And if you increase that distance, you're just increasing the wavelength.

195
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:33.110
So you can see here, if you increase the wavelength, the frequency decreases.

196
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.640
But if you decrease the wavelength when it's coming towards you, when you're emitting out more as it

197
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.970
flies towards you or you're observing more as you fly towards it.

198
00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.410
This wavelength is going to decrease, right?

199
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.300
It decreased by fidelity.

200
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.780
So as a result, your frequency increases.

201
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.370
OK, so this is sort of a graphical representation of a Doppler shift.

202
00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:02.590
I want to beat this horse dead, so I'm going to give you a literally a digital representation of this

203
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:03.390
right now.

204
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.720
Let's jump straight into that.

205
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:05.980
OK.

206
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.620
So as I said previously, one of the best ways to experience a Doppler shift is to actually experience

207
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:16.030
it when an ambulance is blaring its alarms and flies right by you.

208
00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:22.900
What happens in that situation is the ambulance as it's flying towards you, the pitch or the frequency

209
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.860
is higher.

210
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:28.450
But when it goes by, it suddenly shifts such that it's lower.

211
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.950
Now I want you to experience this firsthand if you have not experienced that situation.

212
00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.030
And I want you to take a look at what it looks like on a frequency diagram.

213
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.410
OK, so we're going to you first.

214
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:43.240
I'm going to show you multiple animations to help bang this concept through into your head.

215
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:48.070
Make it very simple to understand is first we're going to take a look at the phenomenon.

216
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.780
You're going to hear what it sounds like.

217
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.670
And then I'm going to show you what it looks like, the frequency response and show how that frequency

218
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:55.780
is shifted, OK?

219
00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.490
What we're going to have here is we're going to have a guy who's going to be the source of a sound,

220
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:07.090
attach a device to his bike and he's going to fly by another individual who is the observer who's recording

221
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:07.180
it.

222
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.110
Now, as you're going to notice, initially, it's could be an annoying, loud blaring noise.

223
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:16.810
But as he flies towards you, when he gets really close, you hear the frequency pitch get high and

224
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.400
then when he flies by you, you're going to hear it.

225
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:23.810
It's going to see your own fly right by and the frequency is going to drop.

226
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:24.160
OK.

227
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.570
This is the Doppler shift.

228
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.650
I want you to experience it.

229
00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.350
So let's play the animation, and then let's take a look at the different frequencies that are observed.

230
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:31.690
OK?

231
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.060
So let's actually go through the animation.

232
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.700
OK, so here we are the guy who turns on the alarm.

233
00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:37.750
That's what it sounds like.

234
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.960
Now let's go to the reference frame of the observer.

235
00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:42.670
And now, listen,

236
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:51.130
did you hear that shift in frequency that was recorded by the observer?

237
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:57.760
So what happened is when he was going by, and this is due to the relative motion of that source frame

238
00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.310
the biker when observed by the actual individual who's recording this?

239
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:09.040
What happens is that that that I've been talking about the distance he travels every time that wavelength

240
00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.940
is emitted, that tends to reduce the wavelength between each successive crest.

241
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.680
And as a result of that reduction, the frequency jumps up and you get a higher pitch.

242
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:26.800
OK, so what we have here on the bottom is the actual response that we saw initially up here.

243
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:27.800
Right.

244
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.070
It's a nice sunny sort of wave.

245
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.510
And what we're measuring is the time in which this is emitted.

246
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:40.570
So in the time which we actually watched the video, there were 25 cycles, 25 wavelengths.

247
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:47.170
Now, if we take a look at the same wavelengths in the observed reference frame, not moving one.

248
00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:52.690
What happens is when it's flying towards you, which is this guy right here, we see that those same

249
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.720
25 cycles occur in a shorter amount of time.

250
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.470
In essence, that t shrink the distance each.

251
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.490
We've had to travel before it got to the observed reference frame.

252
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:10.600
So as a result, we can have more wavelengths in that same amount of time, the frequency jumps up.

253
00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.370
And that's why you have that high pitch.

254
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:16.870
Initially when I was going towards you, when it passes you and you get past that.

255
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:20.380
What happens is that VTi adds an extra distance.

256
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:22.930
Each wave has to go before it reaches you.

257
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.480
And as a result, those same twenty 25 cycles, it requires an additional amount of time to actually

258
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.140
reach the zebra.

259
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:36.610
So what happens is that length of the 25 cycles is beyond the original length and the frequency decreases

260
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:38.320
by this Doppler shift V.

261
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:40.660
So that's exactly what's going on.

262
00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.530
You've observed it.

263
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:47.320
You've heard it and you actually see what's going on here and how that changes the frequency that viti

264
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.250
that relative motion is the key.

265
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.270
I want you to remember that Doppler shift well to motion.

266
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:53.380
Well combined.

267
00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.530
You get this change in frequency.

268
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.940
OK, so we get served exactly what happened.

269
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:03.100
Let's actually look at an animation that portrays this directly next.

270
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:10.400
OK, so now that you've actually heard and experienced the authorship firsthand and I give you a brief

271
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.650
explanation, we're going to take a more in-depth look into that situation by looking at a sort of awfulness

272
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:16.040
situation.

273
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.790
We're going to take exactly what we used with a bike and a sound source.

274
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.830
But in this this case, we're going to a fixed source.

275
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.750
It's going to emit beams.

276
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.500
I'm going to see what those beams look like in the animation and then we're going to take a look at

277
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.280
two scenarios.

278
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.980
Initially, you're going to see the bike riding towards it.

279
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.540
OK.

280
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:34.460
In that case, we know the frequency should increase.

281
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.140
Then we're going to see the bike running past it, going away for the waves.

282
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:43.220
We're going to see the frequency decrease once it hits the source.

283
00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:49.070
What's going to happen is I'm going to parallel initially what was happening when it was coming towards

284
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:55.400
the source and we're going to take a look at both both situations and see how many waves or crests each

285
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.170
bike actually observes.

286
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:02.420
And what you're going to see is that because of that, we see the bike that's heading towards the source

287
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:09.440
is going to see more waves, more crests in a given amount of time, as opposed to the individual who's

288
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.420
driving away from the waves, who sees less crests, less waves in a given time.

289
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.680
Let's actually look at what that looks like and see it digitally in the animation.

290
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.640
Let's play it.

291
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.420
So as I mentioned previously, here's the source it's fixed right in the middle.

292
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.920
It's emitting these blue waves.

293
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:31.550
These described the crest, and in total, when the guy is running towards the fake source, the source

294
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:37.490
has generated or emitted about, let's see about 20 waves.

295
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.530
So here we see the bike going towards and we're counting how many crests it actually hits.

296
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.900
You can see the guy going towards count way more than the guy heading away because of that relative

297
00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.440
motion.

298
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.460
So let's compare the counts at the end close to the end, right one.

299
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.420
It's about to hit the end.

300
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.110
We have generated about 17 in this time period.

301
00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:04.310
The guy that's heading towards the source has observed about twenty four of those waves, and the guy

302
00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:10.400
heading away has observed nine again, as he's just seen in those plots, as I've just described multiple

303
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:10.850
times.

304
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:15.200
I hope this bang that you had, I hope you guys understand this concept now when you're moving towards

305
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.750
that source, when the distance between them is closing that bit, that relative motion minimizes the

306
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:24.710
distance that wave has to travel these blue waves that are coming out.

307
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.840
And as a result, you see more crests.

308
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:33.950
That's why this guy saw twenty four as opposed to the generated seventeen that we as well as he sees

309
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:40.160
in that given time period right now, this guy, when he's moving away, that vti, that wave has to

310
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.860
travel that extra distance every time it's generated.

311
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.540
So he doesn't see as many.

312
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:51.170
That's why he only saw nine of these actual waves as opposed to twenty four with a guy who's moving

313
00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:51.680
towards us.

314
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.510
That's a visual representation.

315
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:57.110
I hope that drives the point home to make it a bit more simpler.

316
00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.700
I'm going to look at one more animation to make sure you guys definitely understand this.

317
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:06.140
And then we'll jump into a derivation of the actual Doppler shift that is observed.

318
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:07.370
OK.

319
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.760
So to wrap up these digital animations and conclude our look into the concept of the Doppler shift,

320
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:18.550
what I want to do is take a source that's moving to the right and take a look at what the waves actually

321
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.150
look like in front of the source and behind the source.

322
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:28.930
Now, as explained previously, that relative motion helps to change the wavelength of the waves that

323
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:29.380
are emitted.

324
00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.350
OK, so if the distance between that, the wavelength?

325
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.020
OK, so in front of it, that relative motion, if you emit one wave and you move towards the wave,

326
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:44.470
the distance between the way that was emitted and the next wave that was emitted or the crests has to

327
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.950
decrease.

328
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:48.580
But that viti right, that relative motion helps to increase the frequency.

329
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.360
So you'd expect the waves to be more congregated in front of the source.

330
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.070
Now behind the source, what happens is you would mean a wave and moves to the left.

331
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.570
C times T.

332
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.710
And then the source moves to the right vti.

333
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:07.120
So that extra vti increases the distance between the emitted waves that increase the wavelengths you'd

334
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.630
expect.

335
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.820
The density of the waves to be less dense and you have a lower frequency, OK?

336
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.490
So we just saw what it looks like in terms of the blue wave, the group crest blue crest that we observed

337
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:19.900
in the previous animation.

338
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.590
We're going to see how that is transformed in the front of and the back of.

339
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:29.380
Now if you're over here and something's moving towards you, more dense waves, more frequency are a

340
00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:33.430
higher frequency response that's going to increase your observed frequency.

341
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.240
If you're behind here and it's moving away from you, you're going to have less dense waves that's going

342
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.030
to decrease the frequency you observe.

343
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:41.200
So let's take a look at this.

344
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.310
This guy is going to move to the right and we're going to see the waves actually look like instead of

345
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.570
having circular ways that are equidistant from one another as you go out.

346
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.160
We're going to see it's going to change.

347
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:57.970
So as it moves to the right that we see, you can see right here, the density of the crest is much

348
00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.350
higher, the frequency is higher.

349
00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.690
So that helps to increase this.

350
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:06.040
So what I have here is the velocity of the light of the wave.

351
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:09.580
And down here is the velocity of the source of the wave.

352
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.960
No, the source.

353
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.670
So let's back up a bit.

354
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.850
Voice is the velocity, the source traveling to the right.

355
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:23.200
So what I have here is we're keeping track of the distance that that was traveled of the first wave

356
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.240
and the distance of the source has traveled.

357
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.340
And what we find here is that in total, the waves may travel vti.

358
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:35.110
But because of the source, the distance between where it went, the actual length of the wave stream,

359
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.790
which we talked about on the kickoff risks was changed by a distance.

360
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:40.750
Vesti.

361
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:46.240
So as a result, these waves have to travel a smaller distance and you have the same amount of waves

362
00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:46.930
that are emitted.

363
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:52.120
So as a result, the more congregated, the density increases and you could see it right here, right?

364
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:59.290
I could talk all day about how the relative motion changed the frequency, but here you can see it real

365
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:00.490
time in the animations.

366
00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.900
This drive the point home.

367
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.040
I want you to keep this picture in mind when we run through the derivation, right?

368
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:12.760
So in the derivation, I'm going to reference the actual length of the wave train, which I'm going

369
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.130
to use, s.t the speed of light here we have.

370
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:22.330
They used the generic V and I'm going to use the source distance v s t, and we're going to take the

371
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:29.680
difference of that and use that to derive an apparent or observed wavelength and frequency.

372
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.420
And we're going to find because of this relative motion, it's going to decrease the distance between

373
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.570
the source and the actual observer.

374
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:43.510
And because of that, we're going to decrease the wavelength and increase the frequency.

375
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:48.760
I'm going to see that again, decrease the wavelength so the distance between each crest.

376
00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.520
And as a result, increase the frequency.

377
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:57.970
So I hope these digital animations give you another perspective of the phenomenal we're talking about

378
00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.440
the phenomenon.

379
00:24:59.440 --> 00:24:59.860
Sorry.

380
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:05.710
And let's jump into the duration and start digging into the math now that you know what exactly is going

381
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:09.220
on and you have some physical intuition with the Doppler shift.
