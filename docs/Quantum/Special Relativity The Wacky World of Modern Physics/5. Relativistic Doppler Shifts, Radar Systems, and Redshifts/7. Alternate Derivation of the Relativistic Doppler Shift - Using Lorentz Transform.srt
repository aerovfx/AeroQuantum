1
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,710
All right, so finally, if you're still not 100 percent convinced by a derivation, we can get the

2
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:30,100
same result by making use of a Lawrence transformation that we painstakingly derived previously.

3
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,610
OK, so this is also going to give you some more experience, more exposure to how we actually use the

4
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,920
Lawrence transformations, what we found previously.

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,260
The last transformation, in fact, is sort of the inverse Lawrence transformation.

6
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,630
This is what it's sometimes called in textbooks is that if we only have measurements as measured by

7
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,330
somebody in the moving reference frame or fill up in the USS Enterprise, in this case, we can figure

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:03,010
out the measurements of around the length X and the time T. as measured by somebody in the radar station,

9
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,390
for example, such as Terence.

10
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,500
Through the following expressions, and so this is a previous assault we obtained.

11
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,610
What we do is we could take another look at the the electromagnetic we that's being transmitted out

12
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,600
from this radar station.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,370
So recall again, we've been using that Terence and his reference frame.

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:31,620
He said that as measured by my radar system, the actual way that sent out is some kind of amplitude

15
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,500
a times cosine times a mega T minus K X-ray.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,470
You should be really familiar with the sky now.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,980
So in order to figure out what the wave looks like in fill ups reference frame, we need the function

18
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,580
in terms of x prime and prime not to index.

19
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,810
So to do that, all we need to do is would use this guide.

20
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,470
This is our map.

21
00:01:52,470 --> 00:02:00,180
This is our bridge that helps us walk over to the other side to see things from a different perspective.

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,460
So we take out our trusty map.

23
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,720
We look up what we want.

24
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,750
We say, OK, I want to see what X is in terms of X Priority Prime, and we literally plug in shot baby.

25
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,710
So we take this guy and we see that we want to get rid of T.

26
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,670
So for T for this portion here, and I'll make it easy for you guys to see what's going on this guy

27
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,280
here, this is T.

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,190
So for T, we know that gamma times t prime plus v rel um.

29
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,270
Or rather, let's back up.

30
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,000
So what we want is to see and what we could do is receive a T right here.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,290
We love that game and that's just gamma times T prime plus v real times x prime over c squared.

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,670
Literally just plug it in.

33
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,820
Then we have a minus K and make it easier.

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,170
This guy is X.

35
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:59,700
Our XTerm, so we know from our trusty map, and this tells us that it should actually be gamma times

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,070
x prime plus v real time Steve.

37
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:02,850
OK.

38
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,070
All I did is substitute in some parameters here, and all we need to do is just simplify and see what

39
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,460
happens.

40
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,100
So what we could do is we could say initially we got, oh, for the first time, we got a gamma omega

41
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,850
t prime.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,010
That's that guy.

43
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,920
And then we have to add a gamma omega times v relative times x prime or C squared.

44
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,660
That's this guy right here.

45
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,500
Now we subtract the K Omega and x prime.

46
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,760
That's that guy right there and then subtract a K omega v relative times to prime, which is that guy

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,630
right there.

48
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:44,130
And what we want to do now is try to combine terms and find what is in front of the Omega.

49
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,840
See how the omega is modified.

50
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,900
So we want to put it back to this central form here.

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,930
One Omega times T minus K times x.

52
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,380
So let's try and group the omega T prime terms.

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,470
And if we do that, what we do is first I'm going to group them next to each other.

54
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:08,550
So for this step, right here, we got a gamma omega T, right, and we want to get this guy close to

55
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:08,940
here.

56
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:17,770
In order to do that, we make we have to make note that K is equal to Omega oversee or rather.

57
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:28,410
Yeah, Omega is equal to Casey Omega over sea is equal to K, and we use this to go from here.

58
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,450
Down to there.

59
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,280
So we take this guy.

60
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:40,620
We plank up back, put a mega oversee in there and we get a subtraction side a minus, or let's back

61
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,270
up, let's make sure we're keeping track of our time.

62
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,470
So we've got this term here.

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,920
Now we're going to get this term, which is right down here.

64
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,570
I'll check out down here.

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:59,650
So this term is just minus gamma omega oversee the Omega, there's a c Typekit prime and then we need

66
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,310
our B relative.

67
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,730
So that's that term, then we're going to get this term next.

68
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:12,150
So, yeah, plus gamma omega well, for X Prime, we want something that looks like this, so we want

69
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,940
to get rid of that omega and get a K in there.

70
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,980
So that's omega is just KC.

71
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,870
So this is going to be plus Gamma K and C. It cancels with that guy.

72
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:29,490
So we get Gamma K v relative, oversee that guy right there.

73
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,050
Bam, we're done with that.

74
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:38,550
So we only have one more turn and this is a minus gamma k x prime and we got that guy right there.

75
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,370
And now all we need to do is group terms.

76
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:48,030
So again, we want to put it in this form and see what we're really interested in is what this looks

77
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,880
like in this reference frame.

78
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,590
The X prime time reference frame.

79
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:59,220
OK, so we're going to try and figure out what that looks like by grouping Omega TS to make a Prime

80
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,040
T primes and figure out what's in front.

81
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,350
So what we have is we see common terms of.

82
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,970
And here a gamma omega t prime, there's a cameo omega t prime.

83
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,140
So that's the commentary.

84
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,130
I'm going to pull that out.

85
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,580
We got a gamma omega t from.

86
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,630
So that is multiply by one minus v relative a receipt.

87
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,220
That's that term right there.

88
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,250
And we could do the same thing for K Richard in that.

89
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,410
We're interested really in the frequency.

90
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,380
So it's not going to be much use to us, but authors do that anyway.

91
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,720
So we know we want a minus K X..

92
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,760
And all I want to do is with the key terms over here, find common factors, be a mechanic prime that's

93
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,480
common here.

94
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:49,600
So we Malta or rather we subtract gamma k x gamma k x times one for this term, which gives you the

95
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,160
negative and an a minus.

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:57,670
The minus can't get a plus sign right there, minus the relative over C that's that term.

97
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,300
So or interested in is this guy right here?

98
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,850
We're going to pull that off the equation.

99
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,630
And in essence, all we did just back up a little bit is we took out our trusty map, the Lorenz transformation.

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,690
We're trying to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions of the universe, and that allowed

101
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,170
us to really transition over to different ways of measuring things.

102
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,940
A different perspective, if you will.

103
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:30,130
So we translated this equation here into a different equation as measured by fill up, and we got the

104
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,630
following assertion.

105
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:38,530
This tells us that our new omega, which is always the term in front of the T, is this gamma one minus

106
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,940
v relativistic omega?

107
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,900
This guy?

108
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,250
Well, if you recall.

109
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,900
Omega is just two PI.

110
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,420
Times the frequency.

111
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:57,410
So if we want to get our terms back, we could say if we multiply by one or two pot each on mega on

112
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,080
both sides, we get our frequencies back.

113
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,160
And what can you tell me about this equation?

114
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,080
Right over to that.

115
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:15,200
This is the same result that we obtained previously, so again, we've done this three times, you feel

116
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,610
very comfortable with the relativistic Doppler shift that we are getting the correct precise result.

117
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:31,190
Next, we want to do is, if you recall, this is just what we call up seas on the USS Enterprise,

118
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:36,380
but we know that he's also going to send signals back when this bounces off a target.

119
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,460
And that's going to fly another Doppler shift, as we talked about previously.

120
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,550
And we want to figure out the two way Doppler shift that results due to this.

121
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,430
OK, so that's what we're going to tackle next.
