1
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:18,780
All right.

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,730
And our last video, we were on a brief journey through history and learned about some of Einstein's

3
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,610
ideas correlated with the photoelectric effect.

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,230
What did we learn?

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,080
We learned that in essence, light, although it is a wave, it does demonstrate some properties which

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,960
would suggest that it is also a particle.

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,530
Right?

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:45,720
We found that its energy is quantized and that there are photons composed along that wave, which in

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,210
essence contain all the energy inside of that actual light that we had.

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,320
That's the mass less particle we talked about and a few videos beforehand.

11
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,030
Now, at this point, we have seen that in in history that we have begun dismantling the whole notion

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,130
that light is simply a wave as proposed through classical electromagnetism.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,770
However, you would think that this day and age, if you heard about this and you are reading about

14
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,710
the history, that this would be enough evidence and convincing enough that people would assert that,

15
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,850
yes, light does have a particle element or property to it.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,200
However, since electromagnetism was the king of the day and we didn't find a lot of discrepancies aside

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,130
from those we talked about the photo electric effect, these are new discrepancies.

18
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,660
People tend to adhere to that classical phenomenon, the classical idea, and they are resistant to

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,580
adopting these new ideas.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,490
So even though the evidence was right in front of them, even though Einstein said, wake up, take

21
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,740
off your blinders and see the truth, they refused to accept that, which is right in front of their

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,220
eyes.

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,700
OK, so back in that day, we were talking about 1985, when Einstein proposed this whole theory about

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,890
photons and packets of energy.

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,630
People still do not believe that there was convincing enough evidence that light indeed was a particle.

26
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,400
So is to say.

27
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,910
So what exactly can you do to convince people of this wolf if life really was a particle, probably

28
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:28,310
one of the most natural ways to convince somebody of those properties, would you collide that particles

29
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,500
another particle and measure the energy and momentum?

30
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,920
And one argument that scientists had back in the day was, OK, well, you showed with your experimental

31
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,870
evidence that they collected.

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,920
I believe Millikin was the individual who did this that.

33
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,700
You know, it seems like the energy can be quantized, the energy is equivalent to each f we got right

34
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,180
here.

35
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,430
Well, if the energy behaves like a particle, what about the momentum?

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,970
Surely, if it's a particle, we should have some momentum.

37
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:06,730
And what do we discover previously in special relativity tennis that Einstein came up with seemed to

38
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,920
suggest that it was indeterminate.

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,740
That momentum was nonsensical, right?

40
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,350
We went through that argument and seemed plausible.

41
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,070
OK.

42
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,010
So in order to really convince these individuals what you would want to do is do an experiment where

43
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,880
you collide a piece of light, a full time particle, if you will, and measure the energy of some recoiling

44
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,440
particle.

45
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,040
OK.

46
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,900
And that's what we're going to discuss in this video in going over something which is very important

47
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,060
historically and also in terms of physics, which is known as compton scattering.

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:47,080
OK, now back in the day after these discoveries were made regarding the photoelectric effect, what

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:54,340
scientists were starting to discover is that another hole in the fury of classical electromagnetism

50
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,360
was cropping up.

51
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,790
So what they were doing, they were developing x rays, which had a very small weight.

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,110
Yeah, very small wavelength and hence a high frequency.

53
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,170
What they're doing, they're producing these higher energy waves.

54
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,810
And this was mostly produced by the reverse effect of the photo electric effect.

55
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,590
So if you took electrons and shot them directly very quickly, a lot of energy into a huge block of

56
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,100
metal.

57
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:21,820
Right.

58
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,920
If it goes to the metal and it stops.

59
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,860
What happens is that energy has to go somewhere.

60
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,010
So something known as breaking appropriately named, it's slowing down on that particle breaking radiation

61
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,710
would occur where the electron will be transformed.

62
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:45,220
All that energy, its kinetic energy into a light or an X-ray, in this case, a very energetic radiative

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,180
wave that gets emitted into the environment.

64
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,990
OK, so scientists were doing these experiments at this highly energetic form of radiation.

65
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:02,470
And what they discovered is that conversely, to what classical electromagnetism asserted, is that

66
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:11,200
if it collided with something else, this X-ray, they found that they measured the scattered wave.

67
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:18,060
And that wave did not have the same frequency as that which hit the surface the incident frequency.

68
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,920
Now this is a big question that a lot of people actually saw the evidence it did not lead because it

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,920
spat in the face of electromagnetism, because what that asserts is that your wave, if it comes in

70
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:33,460
at a certain frequency, bounces off some kind of particle.

71
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,200
It should be emitted with the same frequency.

72
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,600
OK, that was a basic tenet that electromagnetism predicted.

73
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,770
But scientists, again, they're finding the contrary result.

74
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,360
And what they should have done is said, Hey, nature's communicating to me.

75
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,530
Let's listen to it and let's develop theories based upon that.

76
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,050
Instead, they want to worship their theories.

77
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,500
And as we found many times in this course, once you ignore nature, it slaps you in the face by pushing

78
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,960
you along in the wrong direction.

79
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,840
And eventually you put forth invalid predictions, evolve theories and invalid laws.

80
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,980
And that's what happened.

81
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:18,790
So it did not what this was discovered, I believe, was like in 1912, around that kind of time frame.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,260
And it took them all the way until 1923, when an individual named Arthur Compton came around and argued

83
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,820
that I took this x ray right and treated it like a particle and collided with an electron, for example.

84
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:40,000
He argued that when radiation is scattered by electrons, each scattered photon, which is a particle

85
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,570
we've seen this reminds sign in the photoelectric effect results from a collision with a single electron.

86
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,530
And the rules of conservation of energy and momentum hold in the collision.

87
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,990
Whoa, what one word.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,600
What's going on here?

89
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,870
Let's dive into his experiment and try to understand what he was doing.

90
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,080
He was trying to say, Hey, guys, it's a particle we shown that has energy related to that particle

91
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:02,800
photon.

92
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,390
It has to have momentum.

93
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,120
So let's do an experiment or take some kind of radiation from incident photon.

94
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,660
We shine it onto an electron right here.

95
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:23,400
And that x ray is going to be scattered, we want to measure its frequency and also the momentum and

96
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,190
energy of the scattered electron, right?

97
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:26,760
Right.

98
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,440
So this is an electron right here.

99
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm going to put an e right there and another e right there.

100
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,570
And what we can say is that.

101
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,200
Energy has to be conserved.

102
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,530
Momentum has to be conserved, right?

103
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,350
The basic classical tenets of physics have to hold Okay, so well, how do you measure the momentum

104
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,110
of light?

105
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,550
We've never really worked on that before, where we can theorize what it is.

106
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,960
And then you could take your experiment and your data to confirm what you theorized.

107
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,150
That's how you do good science.

108
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,540
We've talked about this many times before.

109
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,460
I'm not going to repeat the many ideas I've put forth in this course, but they should be bang to your

110
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,990
head at this point is very close to the end, right?

111
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,360
I know, get inside.

112
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,380
But anyway, so what we can do is we could say, OK, let's look at the evidence.

113
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,820
What did nature tell us?

114
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,230
Let's take those ingredients and pick something new, a new theory.

115
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,420
And so what we can do is we say, OK.

116
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:25,280
Previously we found Einstein told us and plonk told us that the photons writing these packets of energy,

117
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:31,340
it's equal to the plant constant times, the frequency of that light, of that radiative wave.

118
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,440
And we also found for special relativity that energy also equals picks.

119
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,490
What if we combine this to try and find some kind of momentum and try to measure it?

120
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,840
Sounds plausible, right?

121
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,680
Let's let's do that.

122
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,130
Let's do that.

123
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,390
So what we could do is we say your PC divide.

124
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,000
See, over here, we get your receipt and we say, Oh, well, wait a second.

125
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:59,720
You know, light still has a wave properties so it can use this that's has wave and particle properties.

126
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:09,140
The way property comes from the frequency F and a particle property comes from the quantized photon

127
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,770
and the experiment we're going to show right here today.

128
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:20,150
We plug in each half here and we can make note that if we have a traveling wave, we know the speed

129
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,700
of that wave, which is light, is light, right?

130
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,260
It's radiation is just lambda times the frequency now if you've never seen that before.

131
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,180
So I believe we've yeah, we've encountered this before in this course in the Doppler shift section.

132
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,660
You can look at the units, right?

133
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:42,020
Lambda, that's meters stuff, a length and frequency that's like cycle per second.

134
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,250
So this is the length per second.

135
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,750
That's a velocity, right?

136
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,540
So what we could do is ePrivacy.

137
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,220
Well, yeah, that's just one over lambda.

138
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,220
So we could plug one overlap into here and we got something which just wasn't known at the time.

139
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,420
I didn't call this at the time.

140
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:02,180
This is known as a deep rolling wavelength.

141
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,500
The he.

142
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,750
Wavelength.

143
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,670
And what are the constant theorizes, hey, it's going to cost the medicine?

144
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,830
It seems plausible that it is like this.

145
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,330
Let's do an experiment.

146
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,990
Let's measure quantities that we can and seize.

147
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,160
This works out in the theory.

148
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:25,790
Right?

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,250
And then I'm going to show you that my son's right.

150
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,930
The evidence is right in front of us.

151
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,520
We just need to listen to it.

152
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,660
We need to accept the gifts that nature is conveying to us.

153
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:36,980
OK.

154
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,040
So what he did, he got his X-rays and they were shooting x rays into carbon.

155
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,800
I believe graphite carbon atoms.

156
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:53,120
And what he did is he treated his electrons as stationary stationary particles.

157
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,680
And you might be saying, whoa, wait.

158
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,540
A second in carbon, electron electrons are flowing pretty fast.

159
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,350
They're right.

160
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,340
They're flying all over the place, but they are bound by an electron.

161
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:12,080
And what what was theorized is that OK, we can essentially treat it as a stationary particle because

162
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:16,760
the energy of that electron compared to that of its X-ray, I'm going to do a calculation here to convince

163
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,050
you is so the X-ray energy is so large compared to it.

164
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:27,950
So, for example, an X-ray has a wavelength of like 0.07 nanometres going to use point one nanometres

165
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,780
wicked take.

166
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:36,990
Our equation here is that we know to be true, we have experimental evidence for and plug in for F F

167
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,000
is just c over lambda from this guy.

168
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,840
And one convenient thing you'll see in physics is as we're seeing quantum mechanics, this h c term

169
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,270
here, it's pre-computer for us, right?

170
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,920
That's that's a constant 12:40 electron volts nanometres.

171
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,510
And all we need to do is plug in the wavelength of the X-ray.

172
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,090
So when we do that, we put in point one nanometers.

173
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,200
We get an energy approximately equal to on the order of 10 to the fourth electron volts.

174
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,160
Well, guess what?

175
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:13,020
The energy of electron and should make sense, given the units in a carbon atom is a few electron volts.

176
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,780
So this in essence, he is essentially at rest, right?

177
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,790
It's so small compared to this, we could treat it as being at rest.

178
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,600
So that's what we're going to do.

179
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,820
We're far photons in.

180
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,760
They're going to hit hit that electron.

181
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,420
The photon is going to recoil.

182
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:38,550
We can measure the frequency and using today we reduce particle accelerators, but we can measure the

183
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,540
momentum and also the energy of this electron.

184
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,270
And then we can apply our best friends conservation of energy and conservation momentum.

185
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,540
OK, let's do that.

186
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,100
Let's do.

187
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,930
Let's see what happens.

188
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,210
So what we can do.

189
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,170
First, what to do.

190
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,580
Conservation, no matter what we know, is that initially this guy is at rest.

191
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,630
So we set that momentum essentially to zero based upon arguments we have here.

192
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,750
So initially we have photon coming in.

193
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,600
It has a momentum of p not means the momentum of the photon initially.

194
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,660
And that momentum has to be equal to the momentum that results finally for the final, and that is the

195
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,550
momentum of the photon and the momentum of the election, which we have right here.

196
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,840
And again, these are vectors.

197
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,340
Hence the notation.

198
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:27,740
So it's easy really to measure the election.

199
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,850
We're going to go with that and isolate the electron.

200
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,560
That's what we've dealt with.

201
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,330
We haven't really dealt much with the light.

202
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,130
And that's what does that study here.

203
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,050
So if we isolate P.E. and that's equal to the momentum of the initial photon minus the final photon,

204
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,750
and what we want to do is recall some useful properties of vector analysis.

205
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:55,740
So what we can recall is that if we have the DOT product, the Vector V1 with itself right, that is

206
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:02,100
equal to by definition of the DOT product, the magnitude of the vectors and times each other, the

207
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,270
yuan times v one times the cosine between those vectors.

208
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,460
Now, if we have the two vectors in and of themselves, right, we have one here.

209
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,450
And if it's the same vector, you know, it's pretty much on top of it.

210
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:21,780
So this this angle between it's let's let's back up here, if you had a different.

211
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,360
Guy, you have an angle between it and now would be thrown into here, but if it's the same vector,

212
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,260
like if we're taking the vector people up north, then Theta must equal zero, right?

213
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,660
That guy must be equal to zero.

214
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,820
And you get some really nice results.

215
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,620
So what you find?

216
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,560
Is the following.

217
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:51,050
Basically, it's just equal to the magnitude squared, because cosine of zero is one.

218
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,440
Right?

219
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,800
So you just get basically everything that's on the left right there.

220
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,160
OK.

221
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,950
So what we're going to do is want to take make use of this to simplify our life and get rid of all these

222
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,340
vectors.

223
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,600
Just work of magnitudes, right?

224
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:10,800
So what we could do is we could say, OK, the magnitude of p squared is nothing more than right.

225
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,380
We can use this relationship here.

226
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,460
We can say P Square is going to be p dot p and we're going to use this guy right up here.

227
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,230
Throw this guy into each one.

228
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,560
OK.

229
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,740
So when we do that, we get the dot product of the initial minus the final data into itself.

230
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,240
Again, it's the same vector, so the angle has to be zero.

231
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:38,030
So what we end up with is the initial momentum that into the national momentum this got here.

232
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:46,010
And then you get minus p not plans PPF minus PPF.

233
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,280
Oh, right, right.

234
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,590
That's going to be flipped, right?

235
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,360
We could flip it there.

236
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,710
Equivalence, in essence, because we just get this with the two magnitudes 'cause the angle between

237
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,670
them, that's equivalent.

238
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,490
So we get the minus two PBF got it into p o.

239
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,820
The order does not matter.

240
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,420
And then we get plus PPF, not in the PPF.

241
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,920
Well, we know that from this guy right up here, a vector dot it into itself is its magnitude squared,

242
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,070
right?

243
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,570
It's the norm, in essence.

244
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,790
So we get this p not squared plus p s squared minus two.

245
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,930
We basically use this definition here two times the magnitude of p at times the magnitude of p zero

246
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,530
times the cosine of the angle between those factors.

247
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,670
So in essence, it's sort of like placing a vector onto these guys.

248
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,380
So this guy has to go in that direction.

249
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,090
We got the recoil direction.

250
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,810
Let's find the angle between them that can tell us how it's going to recoil.

251
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:45,350
OK?

252
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,260
Sort of what Arthur was predicting and measuring.

253
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,410
Okay, so we got this nice formula right here for the momentum.

254
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:58,850
All we need to do is apply conservation of energy, and then we could try to isolate our Lando's Momentum's,

255
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,070
our frequencies, whatever is of interest in your analysis.

256
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,430
So what we could do is, again, conservation of energy.

257
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,740
The initial partial portion right here has to be equal to the final portion right there.

258
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,450
We just plug in Chuck Berry.

259
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:17,450
So initially we know that we have an electron at rest, so we're not a energy any c squared.

260
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:26,330
Plus, the incident energy of Atherton, your HSF that must be equal to the energy of your photon and

261
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:30,570
the energy of your electron, and in this energy of the electron, we're still going to have the rest

262
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,170
of energy, but I'm going to throw it straight into there.

263
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,710
OK, so what happens is we want to get again.

264
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,740
The energy of the electron, we want to isolate that guy.

265
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:48,820
And when we do well, we end up with is not energy of the electron is you go to the U.S. energy of the

266
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,680
electron plus.

267
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:59,110
The energy of the incident, photon mines, the energy of the final photon, and this sort of makes

268
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,750
sense because the energy here has to be equal to the rest of energy plus.

269
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Plus, the energy that didn't go to this guy, right?

270
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,270
The difference between incidents and the final third, that makes sense, right?

271
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,960
Some of the energy goes here, the rest goes to there.

272
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,830
That makes sense.

273
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,690
The drywall for insulation, let's proceed.

274
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,170
So in order to proceed, math gets a little messy.

275
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,130
And I apologize.

276
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,830
I don't have a lot of space here, but stick with me.

277
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,550
I'm going to explain it.

278
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,810
You don't understand, OK?

279
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,370
So what would you do?

280
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,650
We can use our relationship that.

281
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,490
E squared is equal to PC squared, plus the rest out of squared.

282
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,080
So we have you.

283
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,680
You have to take the square root of that, right, Angie squares equal to these guys.

284
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,100
So if you take the square root, it's no matter the electrons on C squared plus the rest of energy squared.

285
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:57,210
And then that has to be equal to the rest of energy here, and we could plug in shock.

286
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,020
So the energy of the incident photon.

287
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,560
Well, that should be easy.

288
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,150
We know from right up here and we're going to use this guy because we are interested in the momentum.

289
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:12,770
That's what Arthur is trying to show to convince these scientists and also to understand the situation

290
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,250
at hand.

291
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:21,050
What we need to do is we plug in p p, not c for this guy minus the energy of that guy.

292
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,590
OK, we got momentum's.

293
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Let's try and stop for a mistrial.

294
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,430
Isolate them.

295
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,300
So what we can do is we we need a square, both sides, because, you know, we got this radical side.

296
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,480
We can't really move the terms around unless if ashes.

297
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,890
So if we square the left side, we have to square the right side.

298
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,360
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to say it's a little complicated, but.

299
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,410
It's sort of like this is term one and.

300
00:19:51,080 --> 00:20:00,710
This guy here is term two, OK, so we're here at this time, so we get first initially this turns itself.

301
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:10,590
So we get the rest of our energy squared and we get this guy times this plus this guy tons that so we

302
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,150
get two times the rest of energy times.

303
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,490
The PC turns right here.

304
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,000
OK.

305
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,490
And then we get this guy.

306
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,790
Term two and the parentheses squared.

307
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,710
We're going to factor that through.

308
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:34,160
So to do that, we just do this guy times itself, which would be peanut squared and c squared.

309
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,280
Um.

310
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,800
Plus, PPF squared, c squared.

311
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:49,410
And then you get the cross terms, which would be minus two times peopie, not PPF c squared this guy

312
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,430
here now.

313
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,150
We're running out of space.

314
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:59,770
What we're going to do is we want to get rid of this term because we're interested in the momentum,

315
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:07,490
but the photons so we can use this good at good, awesome definition we derived from conservation of

316
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,090
momentum.

317
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,570
All right, we got this guy here.

318
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,460
We literally plug it in here.

319
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:20,000
OK, we plug it in there because if we put the square on both terms, right, the PPE.

320
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,920
We get p p squared and then we just have to multiply this by c squared on the left here.

321
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:39,970
All we get is p p not squared times c squared plus p p s squared times c squared minus two PPF p not.

322
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,560
C squared cosine theta.

323
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,060
That's where that came from.

324
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:52,000
OK, so now we're going to go up here and we're going to cancel terms and also note that this guy cancels

325
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,630
with that guy.

326
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:59,940
So, yeah, so I got some sort of losing my voice here, but we're going to chug along because it's

327
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,690
for the paramedics.

328
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,810
So what we can do is start canceling terms.

329
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,050
We can cancel this guy with this guy.

330
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,060
We can cancel that guy.

331
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:21,550
With that guy, and we end up with some interesting terms, we see this on the left, which seems pretty

332
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,560
similar to this guy on the right.

333
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,540
We got the two times each room at SometimesI squared.

334
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,000
So maybe we can move this guy over and pull out kind common factors.

335
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:33,850
That's what we're going to do.

336
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:42,400
We're going to move this guy to the left and we get two people PPF c squared right there turns one of

337
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,340
itself minus cosine theta.

338
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,090
OK.

339
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,640
That is all equal to this term here.

340
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,220
All right.

341
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,340
So it's a lot of math, we're trying to consolidate it and make it simplify.

342
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,910
Well, what we find is that.

343
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,410
This guy comes up here two times, Russ Energy and the PC turns.

344
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:10,120
OK, now we want to do is we want to cancel common terms.

345
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,070
So we're going to cancel the TOS.

346
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,950
We can cancel the C squares and we could pull a C out here.

347
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:18,990
We do that.

348
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,370
We get an Emmy, not see here.

349
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,240
We're going to abide by Pia and P, not when we do that plebe.

350
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,760
Not over.

351
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,890
P.P.P is one of the PPF.

352
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,190
Minus whatever you know.

353
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,910
All right.

354
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,380
We're making headway here.

355
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,070
So at this point, you have to choose what you want to actually do.

356
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,090
OK?

357
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,880
We could have landed terms.

358
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,800
We can keep the momentum.

359
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,390
We can try and get this term in there.

360
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,340
All right, we can use this, for example.

361
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:03,280
And what's important is what you're trying to measure in confidence scenario using a spectrometer,

362
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:09,860
it was easy to measure lambdas of the incident and final photon.

363
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:13,950
OK, so we're going to use lambdas, but you could choose whatever you want.

364
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,300
OK.

365
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,530
So if we use this formula that you came up with right here,

366
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,750
we plug that in.

367
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,880
So what I repeat?

368
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,560
Equals lambda over age.

369
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:32,270
Right.

370
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,350
Want to repeat?

371
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,110
So he is going to be Atlanta.

372
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,430
You get an age on the Barney factor route.

373
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,470
That's one overland land lambda.

374
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,500
So that pops up and you get land f minus land and not which is the equation we're looking for, so.

375
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:57,810
What you find is that I'm going to consolidate this bit more, so it's easier to understand.

376
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,420
So we got Delta Land Don, which is going to be lambda f minus land and not is equal to.

377
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:08,420
H.

378
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,760
Over and e c.

379
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,050
And one minus cosine theta.

380
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,810
And what you can find is there's cosine theta.

381
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:34,580
A change in the ladder after this recoil is always greater than or equal to zero.

382
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:40,640
So does that make sense that it tells us that when it scatters off of that electron?

383
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:48,650
The wavelength always has to increase, it cannot decrease, which makes sense because it's part of

384
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,380
the energy is going to this electron, right?

385
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,050
You're going to lose energy.

386
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,150
Your frequency is going to decrease.

387
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,460
And as a result of that, your LAMDA must increase, right?

388
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,940
So in essence, what we're saying is if you had some very energetic x ray like this, it might go something

389
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:18,100
like this who has less energy because right now that's less frequent that you cross the tops.

390
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,080
And hence, the wavelength is much lower, so that makes sense such as well, we would expect the energy

391
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,680
to be lost.

392
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,470
So that's cool.

393
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,650
Well, what's important to know is that.

394
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:44,990
In his experiment, where he had a spectrometer, where he was measuring all the different wavelengths

395
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:53,610
and what he found is something like this, he found that Landa of an X-ray is equal to 0.07 nanometres.

396
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,090
And then he found something like this.

397
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:09,690
So his experiment confirmed that sometimes the photons.

398
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,420
They would have his shift, his Compton shift.

399
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,150
There's constant scattering.

400
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,540
Other times they would just have the x rays and what's going on here.

401
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,320
So sometimes the x rays hit an electron.

402
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,250
Other times they don't.

403
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:36,800
And when they don't retain their Landa, which is accounted for right here, right when Theta is equal

404
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,600
to zero, you get one minus one at zero.

405
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,980
Basically, flying right through it didn't hit an electron when it does hit an electron.

406
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,400
They're scattering around his prediction, which meant that what does that mean?

407
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:52,600
What does that mean?

408
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,470
It means that.

409
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:02,340
The photon, that massless particle and light was a bang conservation of energy, which we saw that

410
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,050
before with the photoelectric effect, but also conservation of momentum.

411
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,470
So when people saw this, they were like, OK, it makes more sense that.

412
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:23,090
We usually conceptualize light as a wave, but it can have particle properties because it obeys everything

413
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,760
we know about particles, it obeys all our laws, it behaves exactly as nature dictates that it should

414
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,350
behave OK.

415
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,010
So.

416
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:43,620
This experiment conducted in 1923 was famous because it said, Hey, we have experimental evidence for

417
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:52,630
what I sign is asserting, so it must be true, and that's when scientists really adopted this idea.

418
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,690
But you have to ask, why didn't light ever show these properties?

419
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,780
Why do we need x rays?

420
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,770
Why do we need that?

421
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,180
And the reason is because.

422
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:08,090
The wavelength of light, which is much less energetic than an X-ray, which we can't see, we can see

423
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:16,430
light because the wavelength is much larger, the frequency is lower and the the the way life is so

424
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,030
large.

425
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:24,190
That any kind of delta you you get is insignificant compared to what we passed, if you didn't experiment

426
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:24,730
like this.

427
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:29,770
Basically your your peak, would you be smashed up into that guy?

428
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,040
And it's hard to resolve that you had any kind of change.

429
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,680
OK, you had any kind of change.

430
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:42,280
So with light, we never really experienced this and we took classical electromagnetism for granted.

431
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:48,550
And it was not until we had this highly energetic particle that we could take a closer look at it,

432
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,620
that these effects would pop up.

433
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:59,620
Just like special relativity, how we had to look at relative phenomena at very high speeds for all

434
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,520
these weird, wacky ideas to pop out.

435
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,770
But this is why you like really didn't tell us it didn't tell the full story.

436
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:16,870
It gave us a limited snapshot of actually a fuller picture, and it took all the way until 1923 to discover

437
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:22,510
this and to accept that light is a particle and a wave.

438
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:30,760
And nowadays, scientists take this particle wave duality principle as a fact and would defend it with

439
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,880
their lives, but took a lot of trial.

440
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:41,560
There took a lot of breaking stubbornness to hold on to the classical ideas to really get to the truth,

441
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,050
get to what was happening.

442
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,290
And as you'll find, this is sort of the end of our journey in the wacky world of modern physics.

443
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,190
But.

444
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:57,930
If you progressed further into the next really main topic, you would probably study, which is quantum

445
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:58,680
mechanics.

446
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,680
You'll find that this idea.

447
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:09,630
Everything we just went through, this whole history lesson really threw the biggest ripple effect into

448
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:12,990
the body of physics of all time, right?

449
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:19,350
Because what happened afterwards is they went on to find that, OK, light is a wave, but it's also

450
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,100
a particle.

451
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,350
Well, guess what?

452
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,880
Everything we take for granted.

453
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,360
Yes, everything you're looking at right now was bought as well.

454
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,820
My face.

455
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,160
Anybody who's sitting next to you right now when you're watching this.

456
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:35,630
Guess what?

457
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:44,060
They have electrons, they have protons in them, and, yup, you guessed it, they a particle and they

458
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,070
are also a Whoa, that's weird.

459
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,450
That's weird as all hell.

460
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,880
So yes, special relativity.

461
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,020
It's wacky.

462
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,070
It's weird.

463
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,200
It's contradictory.

464
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,590
It doesn't seem to agree with her intuition just because we're not familiar with it.

465
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,430
But their ideas out there, which will go on to study in quantum mechanics, which transcend beyond

466
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:10,040
the weirdness, the wackiness and the eccentric nature of nature.

467
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,410
So if you want to go into that, I would encourage you to check that stuff out.

468
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,730
It's very enjoyable.

469
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,700
I have studied quantum mechanics personally.

470
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,860
Do you want me to make a course?

471
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,850
Let me know.

472
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,500
Drop me a message.

473
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,480
If there's a lot of support for it, I may consider it.

474
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,400
But you know, our journey so far, it's been weird.

475
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,680
Quantum mechanics is even weirder, so I don't know if I even want to do that, but the possibility

476
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,720
of the interest, let me know.

477
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,460
Yeah, this this is the end of our journey.

478
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:44,240
I hope you enjoyed learning about this.

479
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,470
I hope you enjoyed learning about how introducing one simple idea can have such a huge, wide ripple

480
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,980
effect in everything we know and understand in this day and age.

481
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,740
If you have any questions, feel free to drop them in our Q&amp;A board.

482
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,380
You want me to do anything.

483
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,640
I do have a YouTube channel.

484
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,510
You can check that out.

485
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,370
I could put up random videos to maybe test drive different ideas.

486
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,920
Perhaps the quantum mechanics, any kind of topic you want?

487
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,970
Let me know.

488
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,370
I want to help you guys learn.

489
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,570
I want to help you conquer everything.

490
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,920
Get that a..

491
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,260
And rise towards success.

492
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,600
OK.

493
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,330
Thanks for supporting me.

494
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,620
I love you guys.

495
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,140
Stay tuned for future products.
