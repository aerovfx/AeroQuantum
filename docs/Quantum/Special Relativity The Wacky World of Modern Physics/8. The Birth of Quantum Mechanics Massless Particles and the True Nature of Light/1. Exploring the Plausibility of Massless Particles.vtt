1
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.680
All right.

2
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.510
So far on this course, we found that by simply redefining our notion of space time and how it operates,

3
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.620
we introduced a lot of ripple effects within the body of theoretical physics, which led to some really

4
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.340
weird relativistic effects that were cropping up here and there.

5
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.310
What we're going to do in this video is we're going to dig a bit further into those ripple effects and

6
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:50.050
introduce probably one of the biggest ripple effects that had the most long lasting impact upon physics

7
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.950
in and of itself.

8
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.270
What am I talking about here?

9
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.600
What we're going to consider is something that seems on the surface, somewhat odd, somewhat contradictory

10
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.850
and sort of absurd, but actually ended up becoming true.

11
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.750
And this is the idea of massless particles.

12
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.290
What I'm going to state that the ripple effect that was created by introducing this into the body of

13
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.860
theoretical physics was huge, right?

14
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.760
By finding out that, yes, indeed, we could have mass particles that eventually gave birth to the

15
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.780
first ideas of quantum mechanics and this whole different subdivision of modern physics.

16
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.710
OK, so let's go back to the question of a massive particle first.

17
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.900
What does that even mean?

18
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.200
Can we have a mass particle?

19
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.180
Well, from a classical physics standpoint, that sounds absolutely absurd, right?

20
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.460
Because we would say that, you know, the notion of a mass is particle that's complete and utter nonsense.

21
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.020
Why?

22
00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.390
Because after all, if a particle was mass lists and its mass M was equal to zero, we can just look

23
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.770
at energy and momentum.

24
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.990
Our classical definitions, right?

25
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.750
The kinetic energy is equal to one and b squared.

26
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.010
And the momentum is equal to M times B, and we can reason through and assert that if we had a mass

27
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.000
this particle, well, these equations imply that there could never, ever have any kind of energy or

28
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.960
any kind of momentum.

29
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.120
And that seems absurd because if we had some kind of particle and it was moving, if it had some kind

30
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.360
of velocity, well, just thinking about classical ideas and concepts, regardless of the equations

31
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.020
that would assert that there would be some kind of energy that allowed it to actually exhibit some kind

32
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.920
of motion, right?

33
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.660
It needed to have some energy.

34
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.590
And by moving, it would have some momentum.

35
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.460
So these equations classically insinuate that it's absolutely absurd to state that a mass mass less

36
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.370
particle could even exist in reality.

37
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.220
Now you might be thinking, Well, wait a second.

38
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.450
We know that weird ideas and concepts crop up when we start going close to the speed of light and relativistic

39
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.620
effects arise.

40
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.660
Maybe that could happen, right?

41
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.130
Well, what we would say is that let's take a look at energy and momentum using our relativistic definitions.

42
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.830
So if we take a look at that on the right side here, what we find is that our equations state that

43
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.310
no energy is equal to garner Times Square.

44
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.330
We get that gamma factor in there and the momentum is Jonathan's Anton's.

45
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.880
But even with these equations, and even with our relativistic conception of these ideas, we see that

46
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.010
the same argument can really apply in relativistic settings, right?

47
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.200
Because if the mass goes to zero, we see another term in both equations.

48
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.130
And that would imply that these equations suggest that even close to relativistic speeds close to the

49
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.810
speed of light, that both energy and momentum would equal zero in every single circumstance that we

50
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.650
could observe.

51
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.730
So we take our relativistic ideas in our classical ideas now would state that what I'm trying to assert

52
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.430
here that possibly there may be a mass is particle that's complete nonsense.

53
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.860
It doesn't make any sense.

54
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.700
OK?

55
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.470
And I'm sure you would agree with that.

56
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.670
However, what we want to do is we want to take advantage of every tool in every equation we have derived

57
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.690
in relativity and see if it agrees with that duplication, right?

58
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.270
Because our theory, our equations should guide the ideas that are born from our head.

59
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.710
It should allow us to initially explore what's going on in nature.

60
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.390
And then based upon those ideas, we use experimental data to confirm what we're trying to assert.

61
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:58.120
OK, so let's explore it a bit more, and then we can dive into some experiments to try and confirm

62
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.810
what the theory is telling us.

63
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:08.080
OK, so what we know is that we have derived different relations between energy and that, and perhaps

64
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.460
they can divulge some interesting facts that can shed some more light upon this master's particle idea.

65
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:16.750
Does it exist?

66
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.090
And if it does, what in the world is it?

67
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.470
What could it be?

68
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.550
All right, so.

69
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.340
Previously, in a few videos back, we have asserted that we can relate momentum and energy as follows,

70
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.890
we can say that the energy squared is equal to the momentum times the speed of light squared plus the

71
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.970
rest energy square.

72
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.550
Now if we take this, you can see clearly that we're not going to run into the same dilemma that was

73
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.600
illustrated here.

74
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:51.420
These relations seem to apply that if we had a massless particle where M goes to zero, then this term

75
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.860
cancels out, right?

76
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.080
We find that this becomes zero.

77
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:05.310
And if we take the square root will end up with is that the energy is equal to the momentum times the

78
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.060
speed of light.

79
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:14.010
Now this is a very important assertion because unlike these two equations, this is asserting that at

80
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.620
some points, depending upon the motion, depending upon the momentum and mass, this particle could

81
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.470
still have some energy, which means that.

82
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:32.090
Perhaps the park will could exist, so this relation is asserting that existence is possible for romance

83
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.300
is particle, even though these equations here are saying that it's complete and utter nonsense.

84
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.710
So that's pretty interesting.

85
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.520
Now we can have a mass particle with some energy.

86
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.350
And I know that sounds absurd.

87
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.100
Sounds weird.

88
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.670
Well, what?

89
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.960
What would the energy be?

90
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.160
How would we calculate the momentum to calculate the total energy?

91
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.490
There's a lot of questions that are evoked once we come to this conclusion.

92
00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.160
OK, I want you to hold on to that in the back of your head, and let's chug forward.

93
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:05.470
Let's ask the more questions and try to divulge some more meaning and some more interesting facts.

94
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:13.330
So the natural thing to do is after we come up with this, we have one other relation that we put together

95
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.010
while studying all this.

96
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.660
What we asserted is that.

97
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:23.590
The velocity of a particle over the speed of light had to be equal to the wind that sometimes the speed

98
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.790
of light P.S. Over eight.

99
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:36.100
So if we take this guy here and we throw it into this guy here, we see something pretty interesting,

100
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.310
right?

101
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.410
So the energy for a mass is particle.

102
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.300
If the mass is equal to zero, must be equal to p times c.

103
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.670
And when we put it into this equation, we see that this becomes one.

104
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.120
And this would imply a very interesting fact.

105
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:58.030
Look, what we have here is multiply sea over sea times one and we see that.

106
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.320
A massless particle must travel at the speed of light.

107
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.920
Whoa, wait, a second, that's a huge assertion.

108
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.690
Let that sink in.

109
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.250
Think about that for a bit.

110
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.320
On NASA's particle can have some energy.

111
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.060
And it will have to travel at the speed of light.

112
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.340
So that's pretty interesting.

113
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.510
Let's try to dissect that a bit if we harken back to our previous studies.

114
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.750
When we are studying momentum, when I stated, is that?

115
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.410
Our momentum gamma and V remember.

116
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:34.190
As we came closer, the speed of light.

117
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.110
It shot up.

118
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:44.330
And what we stated is that the inertia is building up the extra mass relativistic mass, so to speak.

119
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.770
We don't really talk about that.

120
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.120
We want to talk about rest, mass.

121
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:55.490
But the additional inertia makes it harder to accelerate to higher velocity, to a point that it would

122
00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:02.960
take almost an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a particle with mass to the speed of light.

123
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.810
But what this is saying is that Wolf, we didn't have that mass if we didn't have that inertia.

124
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:12.590
We could travel at the speed of light.

125
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.520
OK, so it's sort of interesting how this sort of connects back through ideas about momentum.

126
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.670
And it implies one other thing.

127
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:30.440
We know that only one thing due to what I just talked about what the energy and momentum only one thing

128
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:32.150
in the universe.

129
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.690
As far as we know, can travel at the speed of light.

130
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.160
What is that?

131
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.230
That is light.

132
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:40.950
Right?

133
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.410
Only light can travel at the speed of light.

134
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:52.000
So this means the source insinuates that light is a mass this particle.

135
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.940
If this were true.

136
00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.670
Well, that's sort of weird, because classically in electromagnetism, we assert that.

137
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.620
Light is a wave, right?

138
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:12.590
It's an electromagnetic wave, and it propagates through space at a constant frequency.

139
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:13.610
Right?

140
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.260
So what is it?

141
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:16.490
Is it a wave?

142
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.110
Is it a particle?

143
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.000
Or perhaps it's both.

144
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.050
Who knows?

145
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:21.670
Who knows.

146
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:27.560
So this brings up a lot of interesting questions that puzzled a lot of scientists back in the day.

147
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:34.760
It puzzled Einstein, and we'll find that I came up with a very viable solution and gave birth sort

148
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.900
of to quantum mechanics.

149
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:42.960
In doing so and puzzled another scientist, Max Planck, another individual, Arthur Compton, which

150
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.840
we'll get to in the next few videos.

151
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.610
But if we slow down a bit, let's explore this fact.

152
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.600
There's sort of seems to be a glaring contradiction that I sort of put forth here, right?

153
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:59.600
Because these guys seem to insinuate that a massive particle could exist and there are other implications

154
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.650
behind it, such as that massive particle would travel at the speed of light.

155
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:11.000
But our relativistic equations sort of appear for energy momentum state that, well, you can't really

156
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.050
define these guys.

157
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.530
So the existence of a mass of particles absolutely absurd.

158
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.790
Did we miss anything?

159
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.190
Can you see any kind of contradiction?

160
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:26.070
Let me spell it out for you, so we're going to do is we're going to reconsider these equations in a

161
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.730
different light.

162
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:33.410
And doing so, we're going to find that they do actually allow massive particles to exist, which is

163
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.620
super important because if we want to figure out.

164
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:43.240
The energy and momentum of this massive particle ready to fully define its motion and what's going on,

165
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.620
we would need to know.

166
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.870
How to find these guys the energy and moment.

167
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:54.110
OK, so if we take these and we look at the Garneau factor, something interesting starts to pop out.

168
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.020
We can use this that they've holds that.

169
00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:03.320
So we know that the gamma factor is one of the square root times, one minus the quantity we oversee

170
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:03.860
squared.

171
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.170
And we know that a massive particle as M goes to zero.

172
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.360
This has to go to the speed of light.

173
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.600
This is what the math is communicating to us.

174
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.010
That's what it's dictating.

175
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:21.770
So if we take the limit when the math goes that zero or once it goes through the speed of light, we

176
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.360
see something pretty interesting here as we approach the speed of light.

177
00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.180
This guy blows up, this guy blows up.

178
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.320
And that's why the energy momentum blow up as we approach.

179
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:33.800
See, right?

180
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:35.000
We saw that graphically.

181
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.940
We saw that illustrated before, you know this, right?

182
00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.720
So.

183
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.930
This tells us that the discount factor blows up, but the mass is going towards zero.

184
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.210
So what does that say?

185
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.940
Well, let's let's let's look at the limit.

186
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:57.110
So the limit as M goes to zero, if E is the limit of this guy, we know, we sort of got an interesting,

187
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.290
interesting quantity we get.

188
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.890
Well, this guy is going to go to infinity, but AM is going to go to zero.

189
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.520
So what in the world is infinity time zero?

190
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.140
I don't know that's not even defined, right?

191
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.400
It's not defined.

192
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:19.100
Similarly, if we take the momentum right, we have another game of times Empires V, we get the same

193
00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:25.700
exact oddity, the same exact absurd quantity, which doesn't have any bearing upon reality right now.

194
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:33.350
We have sort of a mathematical interpretation of infinity and zero, but from a physical standpoint,

195
00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.230
from reality, this doesn't convey any kind of meaning.

196
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.980
So what we find is that when we start considering massless particles, these equations break down.

197
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.050
They don't provide any information.

198
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.480
They cannot consider this situation.

199
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:48.740
OK.

200
00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:55.790
So both these quantities are undefined, and that allows for the existence of mass loss particles.

201
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.260
Right.

202
00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:02.930
We can't assert that since the energy and momentum are zero, which they are not, we just prove that

203
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.820
right here that, you know, the particle may have some kind of energy momentum.

204
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:13.340
So there's there's no way it could exist, such as the argument we used in classical mechanics.

205
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.620
So we have a very interesting framework here.

206
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.310
Right?

207
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.330
What do we discover?

208
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:26.980
We discovered that these equations assert that unlike in the classical sense, a mass particle could

209
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.840
potentially exist.

210
00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.160
And furthermore, if it did, we could define its energy.

211
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.940
And it seems like that massless particle not only is light, but travels at the speed of light.

212
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.740
Whoa.

213
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.570
That is a huge ripple effect.

214
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:51.870
We just dumped a huge boulder into the body of theoretical physics and the ripple of create.

215
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.160
It is frickin huge.

216
00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
That's like a tsunami hitting the land, right?

217
00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.450
So what you want to do has a big implication from theory.

218
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.170
Here is.

219
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.640
We want to try and find this particle, right, does it exist?

220
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.440
Can we figure out what it is?

221
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:10.630
How do we measure the energy?

222
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.400
How do we measure the momentum?

223
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:19.740
Well, the first thing this theory is sort of elucidating is that it probably is light.

224
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.590
This is probably giving us some more information about light.

225
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.150
Is light a particle now, is it not a wave?

226
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.440
What, what is it?

227
00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:37.000
These are the questions we're going to explore and to do this and to not fall into the traps that scientists

228
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.220
fell into in the beginning of this course.

229
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:46.830
When they're trying to prescribe how reality shall behave, we have an idea we're going to explore it

230
00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:52.560
in the universe and we're going to let the universe communicate with us and tell us what it actually

231
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.070
is.

232
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:53.580
Right?

233
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:56.730
We do not want to prescribe how the universe should behave.

234
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:04.320
Rather, we want to observe and then use that to form the basis of our assertions.

235
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:11.670
OK, so before we jump into that, I want to do a quick and quick example to show you that, yes, we

236
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.210
can use this to analyze some very interesting scenarios.

237
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:22.050
And then we're going to jump in two different experiments that Einstein and some of his colleagues did

238
00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.210
to try and explore this idea.

239
00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:30.960
And what they discovered was, it's going to be super interesting and it's going to be the birth of

240
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.130
quantum mechanics.

241
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.110
Let's jump at that example.
