1
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:24,520
All right, now that we know that at least in a relativistic setting, massless particles can indeed

2
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,950
exist and that they are most likely some kind of light or radiation or something of that matter.

3
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,270
What I want to do is run through a quick example, assuming that we know what it is.

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,150
So I can show you how this can be used in calculations and how can be used in different applications,

5
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:48,550
because this forms a very core core basis for some different technologies we use in this day and age

6
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:53,140
in modern medicine and other technologies.

7
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,820
But in essence, I want to give you some background before we actually charge ahead and try to figure

8
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,700
out what in the world this massive particle could be.

9
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,820
So the example we're going to run through is the following.

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:10,330
As I talked about previously and a lot of different lectures and example problems, we can have particles

11
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,120
that annihilate and release the rest energy completely, but we have not actually observed that happen.

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,980
We're going to do that in this example.

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,840
So the problem these that consider the annihilation of an electron with a positron.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,450
If you have not heard of a positron before, that's basically an electron has the same kind of mass

15
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,630
as an electron, but it has a positive charge as opposed to a negative charge.

16
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:37,450
So you can imagine positive charge because the negative charge they annihilate, you have no charge

17
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:37,840
left.

18
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,080
And in this case, they both transform.

19
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,440
They get transmuted into a form of radiation or a form of light, if you will.

20
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,870
OK, so they're both at rest.

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,100
They're going to annihilate.

22
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,450
They create that radiation.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,620
We want to do is you want to answer the following question What is the energy of the resulting radiation?

24
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,140
OK, sounds like a very, very simple question, right?

25
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,050
But if you didn't know what we derive previously that the energy of that radiation or that light would

26
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,210
be the momentum p times the speed of light, see, you want to know how to proceed.

27
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,960
So what's going to happen is we're going to have something that looks like the following we're having

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,750
an electron negative in green positron e positive in red.

29
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,880
And what happens?

30
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,150
They're going to get attracted to each other.

31
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,350
They're going to annihilate.

32
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,800
And what we find is that the light which I'm going to will the step of light.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,580
For now, I don't want to divulge the true essence of what we're going to find in the next few videos,

34
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,050
but the light or any light or radiation emitting on the left and the right.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
And we know that if it's light, it must have this new quantity.

36
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,470
We and therefore we don't fully understand yet.

37
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,920
The energy must be p times c.

38
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:56,560
So we have a radiation wave going on on the right radiation wave, going out on the left, and I prove

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,590
how this energy p c and that's respective to the momentum of each wave.

40
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,090
So the one on the left, we're going to label with a one.

41
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,110
That's why it has p one time C and the one on the right is going to be labeled with two.

42
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,140
Now what we do know is that initially, if these guys are at rest, they only have what kind of energy,

43
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,670
rest energy, right?

44
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,010
So we have to run the energies.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,630
They both have the mass of an electron that's two times MFC squared, OK?

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,360
What we want to do on this problem and what you do in every problem and special relativity, you look

47
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,950
at the energy and you look at the momentum and you pull out, you extract the information that you need

48
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,840
is the first thing we're going to consider is the momentum that's going on here.

49
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,140
So in order to do that, we use obviously conservation.

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,920
Well, that's him, right?

51
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,310
So we know that the initial medicine. let's equal the final momentum and we can just plug in our quantities

52
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,420
and chug along, right?

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,080
So initially, these guys are at rest, they have no velocity.

54
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,870
That would mean they have no momentum, right?

55
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,070
So initially pinot on the left side, that is equal to zero right here.

56
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,940
And on the right side, we know we get momentum from the left radiation and momentum from the right

57
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,620
ready P1 and P2.

58
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,070
So if you add them together, what's interesting from conservation of momentum is that when this annihilation

59
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:27,130
takes place, we know that the momentum of these cores or these radiation waves must be equal and opposite.

60
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:34,390
The radiation has equal and opposite momentum, so P1 must equal the negative a pizza and vice versa.

61
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,960
So when we know this, this kid, I wrote some interesting facts that we can utilize when we consider

62
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,090
conservation of energy, which we're going to do next.

63
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,450
OK, so when we do that, we know that the initial energy at state one must equal the final energy right.

64
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,180
We cannot create, not destroy energy, right?

65
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,250
So initially, we know that.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,780
These guys are oppressed so completely that rest energy is completely.

67
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,980
You hear it initially, so that's just two times the mass of the electron.

68
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,590
These both have that asked for an electron positron.

69
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,120
Times Square.

70
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,800
This is our energy on the left.

71
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,790
One on the right.

72
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:18,080
The rest of energy has transformed into this radiation energy, so it must be equal to E1 and E2.

73
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,140
Now if we didn't have the previous lecture of the energy of a mass loss particle of light, if you will?

74
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,240
Well, you wouldn't really know what to do.

75
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,720
Heading for it, but what we do know is that the magnitude of the momentum.

76
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,650
Are equal and maybe in opposite directions, but the magnitude is equal.

77
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,020
So therefore, what we can say is that all this energy is P1 times PC.

78
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,490
And this is P2 time.

79
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,850
See at the moment to have the same name that's used.

80
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,460
That means that each one is equal to E2, and we're going to assert that both of these guys are just

81
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,190
an energy, the energy of the radiation.

82
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:55,850
OK.

83
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,600
So what we do is we could just simplify this, that a same variable and we get to eat here and we can

84
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,870
just do what they cancel out those twos.

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:15,580
And we find that the energy of the radiation, each radiation wave is equal to the rest energy of its

86
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,870
respective particle.

87
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,940
Think about that, right?

88
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,510
We've calculated the energy of electrons before, that's 0.5 one, one mega electron volts.

89
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,650
But this is stating something pretty interesting, right?

90
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:37,230
So we talked previously about mass energy equivalence and how mass is sort of a manifestation of energy.

91
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,500
It's a different form of it.

92
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:45,460
Well, this is telling us that remarkably, the first time, for example, in this course, that all

93
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:50,350
the rest of energy can be utilized and converted into radiation or light.

94
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,990
And that's exactly what it's doing, right?

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,630
So all that energy or all that mass, which stores energy can be unleashed fully?

96
00:06:59,380 --> 00:06:59,740
Right?

97
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,490
We can only to fully we get all this energy out and radiation is fully converted into a form of light

98
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,530
or form of radiation wave.

99
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,540
OK, so that's pretty remarkable.

100
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,530
Nowadays.

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,010
This exact phenomenon is routinely observed in particle physics laboratories where you can do experiments.

102
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,930
And you see a positron whenever you create one.

103
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,430
It pairs up with election annihilates and you can measure exactly this quantity.

104
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:35,330
So we have experimentally, experimentally verified this idea that you can take the mass of this particle

105
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,650
and convert it completely into a different form, which is pretty cool, right?

106
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:46,400
Furthermore, we've also seen this occur naturally in the atmosphere of the Earth of a planet, right?

107
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,370
We know of cosmic ray radiation.

108
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,210
Positrons can annihilate electrons in our atmosphere.

109
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,460
And this was discovered by Karl Anderson, which gives more weight to the existence of this idea.

110
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:05,390
And to follow up with this, another thing which we've observed this phenomenon is our own galaxy because

111
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,740
we've measured light waves.

112
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,760
That actually had the same exact energy.

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,920
Multiple times.

114
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:22,880
And what that suggests that somewhere in the center of our galaxy, we have positrons that are being

115
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,300
created and then annihilate it quickly with electrons that send out these photons somewhere in our galaxy.

116
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,890
This is happening, which is pretty cool.

117
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,430
Why?

118
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,250
Personally, I'm not sure why, but I know that does exist now.

119
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,550
What I think is the coolest use of this phenomenon is in the medical field, in the medical field.

120
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,130
We use something called a pet scan.

121
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,480
Have you ever heard of that before?

122
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,790
Do you know what the acronym actually stands for?

123
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,110
What it stands for is positron emission tomography.

124
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,710
OK.

125
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,470
So as the name implies.

126
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,520
We're emitting positrons, and you may be thinking, well, if there's a pilot trying to make quickly

127
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,360
annihilate with an electron that may send off some kind of light.

128
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,140
Well, what would happen if we had a detector that measured that light?

129
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,930
What we do is we get positron emitting chemicals and compounds.

130
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,910
We inject that into a patient.

131
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,210
And that chemical is going to get concentrated in different areas in a patient's body.

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,900
So in doing so, that can allow us to gather information about different areas of interest.

133
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,170
Right.

134
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,650
Let's say we want to monitor where glucose is being used.

135
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,990
You inject the chemical and the glucose is used pretty predominantly within the brain.

136
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,320
Right?

137
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,480
That's its main source.

138
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,460
I believe it's at least one of its fuels for you to think.

139
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,950
So this would concentrate in the brain.

140
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,340
Positrons would be emitted from that chemical.

141
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,550
And then it would annihilate quickly with the election, we have a lot of electrons in our body, right?

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,720
And then you would get some kind of radiation that you can observe.

143
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,740
So you could look on a scan and wear this light is pretty predominant.

144
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,730
That can tell you that different phenomena is occurring in the body.

145
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,420
We use this to take a look at, Oh, whether it does, this chemical can concentrated in an area with

146
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,240
cancer that can help us scan for cancer.

147
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,620
So this is a cool utilization of this concept of this idea.

148
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:31,380
And ever since we theorized about mass particles and verified it, which we'll talk about in the next

149
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,850
video, we've come up with pretty cool technology, pretty cool uses for it.

150
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,240
And yeah, this is a really cool idea.

151
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,400
So I hope you enjoyed that example.

152
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:47,700
I hope you enjoyed learning that, yes, a massive particle can exist and that it most likely is some

153
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,630
form of light.

154
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,700
What we're going to do in the next video is we're going to explore that idea and explore what scientists

155
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,900
actually had to delve into, what questions they ask, what experiments they conducted.

156
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,210
And we're going to figure out that this is going to elucidate some really, really cool, interesting

157
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,310
facts and we a big ripple effect within the theoretical body of physics.

158
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,810
And then we're going to wrap up the course.

159
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,190
All right.

160
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,240
Stay tuned.
