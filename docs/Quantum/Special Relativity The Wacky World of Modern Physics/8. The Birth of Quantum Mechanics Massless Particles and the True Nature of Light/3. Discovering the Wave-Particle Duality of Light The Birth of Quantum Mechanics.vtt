1
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:24.170
All right, in our last few videos, we're able to use our tools for special relativity to show that

2
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.410
a mass particle could indeed exist.

3
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.390
However, we didn't really know much about what it was or even if it did exist right.

4
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.650
The theory and the equations were telling us that this massless particle would have to have a speed

5
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.750
equivalent to the speed of light, which suggests that that massive particle is light.

6
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.550
But we have not actually observed yet.

7
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.700
So as I usually say and a lot of my videos is first, you want to observe, then analyze, develop theories

8
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.220
and then critique, right?

9
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.590
Whenever you try to prescribe how the universe should behave based upon theory that can lead you astray

10
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.540
and result in a lot of problems.

11
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.410
So back in the day when this was probably first observed and first looked at, it probably started very

12
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.050
strange, probably sounded like a radical idea that people were very hesitant to actually accept.

13
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.380
So what happened is a lot of experiments had to be conducted to try to figure out what in the world

14
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.010
this mass, this particle associated with light, which is has previously been theorized to be some

15
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.970
kind of wave.

16
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.930
What exactly is this?

17
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.480
What I'm going to do in this video is it's going to be sort of a history based lesson.

18
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.950
I'm going to talk about some of the experiments, some of the problems associated with them and the

19
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.630
results that came out of that, which helped to define what this mass was particle is and form the basis

20
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.260
of quantum mechanics as we know it today.

21
00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.160
Now first, what I want to do is review what we know about light from a classical perspective from INET.

22
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.490
Right?

23
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.940
So from a classical perspective, physicists believe that the energy of radiation of light, of any

24
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.620
kind of wave which had a given frequency f should be a continuous, unchanging variable.

25
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.960
And it should also be proportional to the square of the amplitude or intensity of the wave.

26
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.340
What in the world am I talking about here?

27
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.900
Let me break that down for you.

28
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.740
Now, if you had a light and you increase the intensity or in other words, you made it brighter, they

29
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.520
theorized that that should increase the energy.

30
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.010
Furthermore, if you had some kind of light of some kind of frequency that was supposed to be continuous

31
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.520
throughout space, it should not be off.

32
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.850
OK, so this is an idea we took for granted back in the day.

33
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.280
That light was a wave and it had these properties.

34
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:59.360
So given that we started studying light further and the first instance in which we gave hints towards

35
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.950
a mass particle came in nineteen hundreds when we were studying the energy of black body radiation.

36
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.240
So during this time, scientists were taking a black body.

37
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.150
If you don't know what a black body is, as the name implies, it's black.

38
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.470
The color black absorbs all light, absorbs all energy.

39
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.120
It doesn't reflect anything, but all we know is that when that body is heated up, it emits some radiation.

40
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.990
And what scientists were trying to do is they're trying to measure the distribution of that energy or

41
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.450
radiation per each wavelength.

42
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.600
So they're trying really to develop some kind of spectrum.

43
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.000
And they were having a lot of difficulty doing it because they assumed that this was really in essence

44
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.510
what they did.

45
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.560
They feel the same lesson I talked about at the beginning of this course, right?

46
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.050
They are trying to prescribe how nature should behave instead of observing what it was doing and then

47
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.050
using that to develop their theories, right?

48
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.980
So what happened in nineteen, while this individual named Max Planck was studying the energy of black

49
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.980
body radiation trying to resolve this issue?

50
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.660
He first asserted that radiation emitted by a body is quantized, right?

51
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.830
It comes in discrete quantities, but it's also quantized by its integral multiples.

52
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:32.840
While this quantity h times f OK, you know what f is f is the frequency of the radiation of the light.

53
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:40.670
But when the world is this h guy, this h is called the Planck constant, and it's something he was

54
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.340
able to measure and determined experimentally.

55
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.500
But what he found is that whenever he assumed that radiation was quantized up, there are packets of

56
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.720
energy associated with it.

57
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.880
He got results which.

58
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.850
He was able to predict that the data behave in a certain way and it matches experimental results.

59
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:11.450
So this gave way to the fact that, hey, you know, this idea that it should be a continuous wave,

60
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.500
a continuous variable?

61
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.180
Maybe it's discrete ized.

62
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.390
Maybe it has quantized energy energy packets associated with it.

63
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.100
And it isn't what we have theorized to be in electromagnetism.

64
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.900
So this is the first instance in which we can all this quantized idea, and that should sound like quantum

65
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.540
mechanics.

66
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.270
And it's literally the birth of quantum mechanics of quantized ideas.

67
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.560
Now.

68
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:48.200
When we sort of gave name to this massless particle, it wasn't through black body radiation, but a

69
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.090
lot of the experiments that did give birth to what this NASA's particle is borrowed a lot from this

70
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.040
experimental black body radiation, which Max Planck first developed.

71
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.770
Now, jump ahead five years.

72
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.640
What happened?

73
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.110
This is when Einstein came into into the picture.

74
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:16.640
So at this time, scientists were struggling with another idea another new phenomena, which is known

75
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.290
as the photo electric effect.

76
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.790
Now, if you have not heard of this before, have it's probably associated.

77
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.430
You recall that it's associated with Einstein.

78
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.360
But if you have not heard of it before, as the name implies, you know, I like to say the words dictate

79
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.680
the meaning behind physics.

80
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:40.550
The photo electric effect states that if you have some kind of incident light upon a metal surface,

81
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.350
some metal body, it's going to emit electrons.

82
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:53.120
And what you can do is you can shine incident light on metal and you can collect those electrons and

83
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.030
measure some kind of current they create, right?

84
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.130
This is the basis of how solar panels work, right?

85
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:08.150
It takes the sunlight, it converts it into electrons, and then that that current is utilized.

86
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.310
OK, this is a modern use of this idea.

87
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.760
But back in the day, we're doing experiments on this photoelectric effect and some weird ideas were

88
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.480
cropping up.

89
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.280
OK, so how will we?

90
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:27.020
Measuring this effect back in the day, they put together this apparatus where they had a glass isolated

91
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:34.040
tube and they had two metal plates as depicted, one right here and one right there.

92
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.490
So scientists would do is they would shine some light.

93
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.700
Some radiation onto one plate.

94
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:47.780
And that what he meant electrons, which would zoom over to this other plate, which could collect those

95
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:53.000
electrons, and then you could measure the current as follows over here with nanometer.

96
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:02.840
Now, what you can do is you can apply a voltage to this plate here, and depending upon the voltage

97
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:10.920
that can either attract these negative particles, these negative electrons, or repel those electrons.

98
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.660
So.

99
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:19.180
You know, this idea in and of itself doesn't seem super strange from a classical standpoint because

100
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.070
you should light into something else, you know, maybe that absorbs light that he met some kind of

101
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.910
electrons.

102
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:25.780
Right?

103
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:32.190
And you can actually measure the energy of these emitted electrons using the voltage here.

104
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:38.860
What you can do is if you have a potential ness to see that when you increase the stopping potential,

105
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:45.940
the S on this plate, what's going to happen is that at some point that potential is going to be so

106
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:52.900
high that no electron has sufficient energy, kinetic energy to overcome that potential.

107
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.550
And you don't collect or generate any kind of current right.

108
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:02.530
So what you can say is that you can say the kinetic energy which is generated in this electron.

109
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:10.270
One of these emitted mass should be equal to the potential you measure towards the electron charge.

110
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.500
As follows, right?

111
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.790
Conservation of energy.

112
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:20.970
So you can equate the kinetic energy to the energy, what's trying to stop these electrons from being

113
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.440
collected and generating current?

114
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.450
And what we observed by measuring these quantities is something interesting.

115
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:36.010
So if we back up a bit back up here, classical theory in electromagnetism states that.

116
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:44.700
If you increase the intensity of your light, your energy of that radiation should increase proportionally.

117
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.770
But what we found is that if we increase this incident light upon this plate.

118
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:57.370
If it's increase that the intensity of the instability is increased, the number of ejected electrons

119
00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:02.050
increases, but their kinetic energy does not change at all.

120
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.360
Instead, scientists were measuring this.

121
00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:12.070
Yes, in such a way that you get the same kinetic energy with the same energy as electron.

122
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.890
Regardless of the intensity of the light that's coming in.

123
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.710
Right, so that was a problem that seemed like electromagnetism did not fail, that it did fail, it

124
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:26.180
could not explain this phenomenon.

125
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.820
We had another problem number two.

126
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:36.650
That, you know, is the incident lights frequency F is reduced below some critical frequency.

127
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.090
If not.

128
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.440
So I just found that no electrons were ejected.

129
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.410
They can increase the intensity of the light as much as they wanted, it would not get ejected, but

130
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:55.950
that seemed that seemed weird because, you know, if you got a small frequency, you could just bump

131
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.840
up the intensity according to this.

132
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.270
That would increase the amplitude.

133
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:04.470
That would increase the magnitude of that wave.

134
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:11.380
And that should increase the energy and allow some electrons to be ejected, so when the world is going

135
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.690
on here, and this was very confusing back in the day and it was not until I started looking around

136
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.030
and said, Push you crazy guys.

137
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.610
It's right in front of you.

138
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.950
Listen to Nature.

139
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.090
It's speaking to you.

140
00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:29.830
Take what it's giving you and use that to develop your theories.

141
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.490
I don't try to save your precious electromagnetism.

142
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.200
Listen to the universe, that's your friend.

143
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:44.220
So what he said, he made this stark statement back in 1985 which resolved this.

144
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:51.720
And help to really identify some kind of massless particle, what he said is that the energy and a beam

145
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.230
of light is not distributed continuously through space.

146
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:56.250
No.

147
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:04.710
Rather, it consists of a finite number of energy quanta, just like Max Planck said, which are localized

148
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:12.630
at points which cannot be subdivided and which are absorbed and emitted only as whole units.

149
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.580
OK.

150
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.730
That's a big condensed statement, let's try to break that down, so we said it consists of a finite

151
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:20.930
number of energy quanta.

152
00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:28.040
So another way of thinking about that is that, you know, maybe light is a wave and then it has some

153
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.270
packets of energy.

154
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:39.030
Along that wave, maybe something like this traveling along that wave, that's sort of like a wave particle

155
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.040
duality as such.

156
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:47.250
And as these, these little packets hit the electrons, the electron absorbed that energy and flies

157
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:47.550
out.

158
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.540
So in a finite number of energy, it's local.

159
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.860
Localized at different points can all be subdivided.

160
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.440
And it's absorbed any minute only as whole units, well, that sort of suggests that it's.

161
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.340
Sort of a particle, some particle with an energy.

162
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:12.580
That could be this hgf that Max Planck identified, but it's important to note that this idea here it

163
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:19.510
takes max plunks idea of quantization and builds upon it by stating that it's we have these segmented

164
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:21.190
packets of that energy.

165
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:28.150
Now, the question then becomes, how does this actually result with one this year?

166
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.420
Well, by adopting this theory.

167
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:38.120
It helps explain both one and two as well as well one states that, you know, at the intensity of the

168
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.290
incident like is increased.

169
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:44.540
We see that the number of ejected electron increases, but the kinetic energy does not change at all.

170
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.150
Well, we have higher intensity of light, we're going to have more packets or packets are going to

171
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.170
have a higher chance.

172
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.460
We're packets of protons have higher chance of hitting an electron, which means that you would get

173
00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.030
more electrons emitted off of this place, so that makes sense.

174
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.800
But the energy?

175
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:11.900
Of each photon that's hitting it right, there has to be HSF, so the electrons that are emitted, the

176
00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.670
energy must be equal to each.

177
00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:14.630
Right.

178
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.220
There's just one photon hitting it, and that's the kinetic energy you get.

179
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:26.920
Kinetic energy is unchanged, so that explains that explains it pretty elegantly and very easily.

180
00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:33.700
That's probably about, you know, if you have some frequency f that's reduced below a frequency, if

181
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.520
not, no electrons are ejected.

182
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.810
Well, to solve that again, that's pretty easy.

183
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:48.610
You can just say that if the photon energy earth is lower than the amount to eject an electron, right?

184
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.950
If a photon has lower energy than the electron needs to escape the metal.

185
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.210
The photo will be unable to eject any electron.

186
00:14:59.450 --> 00:14:59.720
Right.

187
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.160
That's plausible.

188
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:12.020
So what we know is that an electron is bound to different metallic atoms and it requires energy to be

189
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.800
released from it.

190
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.330
So what if you fire a light that has photons packets of energy?

191
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.270
H f that's less than that energy, the work potential of that metal, that's what it's called.

192
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.750
To get by.

193
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.840
So we say the work potential to get out.

194
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.140
We define it as if not of metal.

195
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.650
What's going to happen?

196
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.180
Well.

197
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:44.700
It's going to stay intact, can't it can't escape its trapped in an energy potential sort of use quantum

198
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:45.690
mechanical terms.

199
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:46.500
So.

200
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:52.520
What Einstein did is he's like, guys, look, this makes sense, this is what nature is conveying.

201
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:53.790
This is what it's telling us.

202
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.350
Let's listen.

203
00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:56.400
Let's listen.

204
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.130
Let's not let electromagnetism.

205
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.290
Plug our ears so we don't hear what the universe is communicating.

206
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.330
This is just what it is, and it explains everything brilliantly.

207
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.540
So we went a step further.

208
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:17.410
What he said is that, well, any kinetic energy that these electrons have, the photons are going to

209
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.990
hit the electron in this plate.

210
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.530
It's going to come off and the energy it has is.

211
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:29.030
The energy of the photon mines, the energy that is needed to escape.

212
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.780
Right.

213
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.680
That that's plausible.

214
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.810
So what he did, he said that if you do an experiment and measure all this, this stuff.

215
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.250
Measure this guy.

216
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.740
The actual energy.

217
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.600
Of that electron.

218
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.470
You should be able to confirm what I'm talking about here.

219
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:57.570
So Einstein did not do the experiment himself, and I'm sort of running out of space here, but.

220
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:04.030
Another individual later on, then an experiment, it was actually quite hard to conduct.

221
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.430
Much of the details myself, but.

222
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.200
He collected data.

223
00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.570
Well, look, something like this.

224
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:24.020
And nowadays we use Excel, but if you fit some kind of line to this.

225
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:31.940
As as such, which is not working for me because my blue marker is dead.

226
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.370
It was just dead completely, so we're going to pack up and we're going to use a green.

227
00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:46.030
So when you said a line, you got something like that, you see quite.

228
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.260
Quite clearly, basically this.

229
00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:54.830
Resources, your energy.

230
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.780
Is your frequency?

231
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:02.900
And this guy is your intersect.

232
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:07.550
So using this, the URL to verify that this.

233
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.500
This guy here, energy is equal to Jeff Plant's constant.

234
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.450
They got a value for that and a match exactly what Max Clark was saying.

235
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.150
So you look at these experiments.

236
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.800
And we suddenly have evidence.

237
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.090
Which they vote is the fact that light and radiation.

238
00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:40.900
Is composed of massless particles, which are quantized packets of energy, right?

239
00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.950
So we have some evidence of it.

240
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.900
We can measure sort of the energy associated with that particle.

241
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.150
But it was still a little unclear because a particle.

242
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.680
It has energy, but it should also have momentum.

243
00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.490
OK.

244
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.100
So how do you calculate the momentum?

245
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:13.150
So at this point, people still do not believe that there was a massive particle, that light must be

246
00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.810
some kind of wave and it could not be a particle.

247
00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.850
It did not have this wave particle duality, which you take for granted nowadays.

248
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:22.390
So.

249
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.190
What had happened is, and I'll talk about this in the next video, the next topic we'll dive into is

250
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:38.790
we had to do something known as the Compton experiment to assess the Compton effect.

251
00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.350
And basically, what you could do is you could take any kind of instant light.

252
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:47.300
Try and scatter it against some kind of particle, some electron.

253
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:53.180
What have you and then measure the energy of that scattered particle?

254
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:58.850
And that can help you determine precisely both the energy and the momentum.

255
00:19:59.060 --> 00:19:59.440
OK.

256
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.420
That's what we're going to talk about in the next video.

257
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:03.590
Stay tuned.
