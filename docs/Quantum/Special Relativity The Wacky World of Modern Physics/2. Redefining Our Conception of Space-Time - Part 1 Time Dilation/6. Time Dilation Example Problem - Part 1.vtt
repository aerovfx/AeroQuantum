1
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.600
All right, now that we derive this new weird concept for time known as time elation, what I want to

2
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.790
do is take a step back and slow it down.

3
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.520
Run through an example problem and allow you to practice some problems on your own for set.

4
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.250
You can run through different questions that arise when dealing with time dilation and build up intuition.

5
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.810
Why?

6
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.750
Because we learn physics by doing physics.

7
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.760
OK, so let's jump into our first time dilation problem.

8
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:58.250
For example, if you will, this problem, the statement says a rocket ship leaves the Earth at a constant

9
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.760
speed.

10
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.550
And again, this is the key term we want.

11
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.370
Do you know that we can use ideas from constant or special relativity?

12
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.720
We need a constant speed for our initial reference frames to arise.

13
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.880
But we're going to have a class.

14
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.340
The speed of 0.8 has a speed of light, see?

15
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.310
And the problem states when I clock on the rocket says one hour has elapsed.

16
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.090
The rocket ship sends a light signal back to Earth.

17
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.190
Now there are going to be multiple parts to this problem, but in part a what we're going to try and

18
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.800
tackle is according to Earth clocks.

19
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.140
When was the signal set?

20
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.860
Now, as I said in the first section when we ran through our example problem, I stated that the path

21
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.440
towards success on any special relativity problem, that path is paved by paying attention and labeling

22
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.470
our different reference frames, figuring out which one is the proper time.

23
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.960
As we just ran through and also are counting, keeping track of everything and sorting it out in your

24
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.980
mind, if you can do those things, if you have these elements within your problem-solving, you will

25
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.130
always pave a path towards success.

26
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.260
OK, so let's do that now.

27
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.770
The most important thing is in special relativity, especially with time dilation so far is figuring

28
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.960
out what the proper time is.

29
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.460
And as I said in the past few videos, proper time is determined by figuring out when the two events

30
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.370
that transpire that we're trying to figure out the time between when they happen in a reference frame.

31
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.550
At the same point such that that reference frame appears as if it's at rest, OK?

32
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.650
So what I want you to do on these problems is.

33
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.690
Label out again, accounting.

34
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.100
Label also different events and then use that to figure out what I just said.

35
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.520
Right.

36
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.750
We can make it easy.

37
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.370
We can make it easy if we do that.

38
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.360
So for people on a we know there are two events.

39
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.430
Look, we're trying to find when the signal was set.

40
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.870
So there are two events between that elapse of time.

41
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.830
We have event one when our rocket ship flies out, launches out of the Earth, and then we have event

42
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.680
two when the signal is set back to here.

43
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.100
So you get one leading the Earth event to sending a signal.

44
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.810
So for proper time, in order to designate that the question is in what reference frame do these events

45
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.190
occur in the same place?

46
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.080
What a shame is that?

47
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.210
Well, in the rocket, we know that when we leave the Earth, according to somebody in a rocket.

48
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.090
It happens when they're standing in the rocket.

49
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.280
And then when you send a signal, they're standing at the same point in the rocket and they're a reference

50
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.730
frame.

51
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.140
And that's when it's sent back.

52
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.210
So, in other words, if somebody isn't a rocket, they're standing on the rocket the entire trip.

53
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.500
And it looks like the Earth is going back.

54
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.780
It's moving behind them.

55
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.490
And when they get to sending a signal out, they were just standing right there.

56
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.690
They push a button on their console.

57
00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.270
The signal gets sent out and it goes back to Earth.

58
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.340
So from that reference frame for this problem, our proper time.

59
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.780
Tenants must occur in the rocket ship, right?

60
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.290
These two events occur in a same spot in that reference frame.

61
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.090
But according to Earth, that one occurs right here when the rocket leaves and then signal sent at a

62
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.030
different position.

63
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.380
Up here in outer space.

64
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.110
OK, so this is the big challenging part in tackling any problem like this.

65
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.210
Figuring out what the proper time is.

66
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.380
But once we have that, we can just utilize the time dilation equations we derived previously.

67
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.140
So what was that?

68
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.260
What we stated was that time dilates or a moving clock appears to move slow.

69
00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.950
So we stated that on Earth, where we don't have the proper time built at sea.

70
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:03.050
All right.

71
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:16.310
This time must be dilated by the Lorentz factor gamma delta t not.

72
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.940
And I'm going to put a rocket here just for extra emphasis.

73
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.950
You can use any kind of labelling system you want.

74
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.390
That's what I chose to use.

75
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.770
But actually, I'm going to back up a little bit to get some information on the board for you what I

76
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.760
would want you to do.

77
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.040
And this is what has worked for me, especially in engineering, when you need to keep track of different

78
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.490
numbers.

79
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.130
I like to put in a given field on my piece of paper, usually at the top right.

80
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.240
I put a given.

81
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.160
I specify what I'm looking for.

82
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.720
So I have that right in front of me.

83
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.220
It's right there on the paper.

84
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.940
If I get distracted, I can always go up to the top, refresh my line and then jump back into the prompts.

85
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.640
What we are given is that we have a constant speed of relative speed.

86
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:03.210
You sort of wrote here, but I'm going to I'm going to read it here also to keep track of it 0.8 times

87
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.800
speed of light.

88
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:16.520
And what I'm going to say is that Delta T rocket, just because we determine it is proper and there

89
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.960
we go, we got that list right there.

90
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.770
So all we really need to do is we figure we did the hard part.

91
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:22.850
We did the physics.

92
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.070
Now we just need a plug and chug, right?

93
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.940
So what do we know that the Lawrence factor is we know that Delta to Earth is going to be one or the

94
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.620
square root of one minus B to square it, or B or C.

95
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.500
So this was the relative velocity over see this whole quantity squared.

96
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.950
Finds Delta is not all the rocket.

97
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.230
And we know that is.

98
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.020
That's right here, actually forgot to write that there.

99
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.770
So this guy is proper and that's going to be one of ours.

100
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.840
We got all the ideas here.

101
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.590
We got our governing equation here.

102
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.020
All we need to do is throw the numbers in and just throw into our favorite mathematical mathematical

103
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.280
program or calculator.

104
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:14.490
So we end up with one minus the square root of one minus B relative.

105
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.260
Well, that's 0.8 C, and we're going to divide by C here.

106
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.260
We square this guy.

107
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.710
And that's multiplied by one hour because the hour is getting diluted, so we can expect the delta to

108
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.830
Earth to be larger, if it isn't, you messed something up.

109
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.930
So remember bill that intuition.

110
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.900
Use it as a guide to get to the correct solution.

111
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.540
And when we do this calculation, throw it into my personal favorite MATLAB.

112
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.300
We end up with Delta T as measured by Earth.

113
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:58.920
It following it is one point six, seven hours.

114
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:06.900
So as I was saying, our intuition dictates based on what we study so far that the Earth time between

115
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.730
these two events must be longer.

116
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.650
Space time must bend a bit to account for the second postulate special relativity.

117
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.060
So this makes sense.

118
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:21.390
We have zero six seven hours longer than that, which is measured by the Rock.

119
00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.950
In other words, this is saying.

120
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.440
A moving plot.

121
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.030
Is observed.

122
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.440
To move.

123
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.360
You know, all right.

124
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.880
So that's ideal for intuition.

125
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.340
We're going to go next when we want to do is we want to tackle Part B of this problem.

126
00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.560
Let's do just that.

127
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:58.300
All right, now, in Part B, what the question asked is if first, according to Earth clocks, how

128
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:04.510
long after the rocket left the the signal arrive back on Earth and the way in which we're going to tackle

129
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:09.130
this part is by jumping back to our special postulates a special relativity.

130
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.200
What did the second postulates say?

131
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:16.870
What does that say is stated that regardless of your reference frame, the speed of light is always

132
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.680
going to be constant.

133
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.710
It's not going to change.

134
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.990
And we verified this multiple times through a ton of experiments.

135
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.560
The speed of light is the speed of light.

136
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.770
That's just what it is.

137
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:33.040
So if we can use this, what we can do is we can use basic kinematics relationships to say that the

138
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:40.690
speed of light when it's transmitted from the rocket, it's going to speed right back to Earth at the

139
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:49.570
speed of C and using, you know, V equals Delta X over Delta T, we can figure out what the time is,

140
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.440
according to the Earth.

141
00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:56.710
But in order to do that, we need the distance it has to travel, so we need to figure out, according

142
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.340
to the Earth.

143
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.990
This is an important fact, right?

144
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.750
We are in the Earth reference frame, according to the Earth.

145
00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.660
How much distance does that light have to travel?

146
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.820
So that's what we're going to consider first.

147
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.480
And the way in which we do that is, again, we use basic kinematics.

148
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:17.470
Well, if the speed is constant, we know that the relative speed of the spaceship when it's flying

149
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:26.770
out, that has to be the total distance Delta X, according to the Earth Delta X out according to the

150
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.220
Earth.

151
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.640
That's going to be dealt the three out.

152
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:40.060
According to what we already really have right here, this should be deputy out.

153
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:46.270
We're expanding upon that variable name to make sure we stay on top of what's going on in the problem

154
00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:46.730
again.

155
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.150
Labels aren't on keeping track of everything.

156
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.530
Use whatever works for you.

157
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.670
We need good accounting.

158
00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.570
But using this, we know the relative speed of the rocket.

159
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:56.200
It's point eight.

160
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.010
See, we know.

161
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.880
Delta T out, which is just that right there.

162
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:07.330
So all we really need to do is calculate the distance according to the Earth, that this has flown when

163
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.690
it sends a signal, because that's the distance, the light will have to travel back.

164
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:17.560
So we just multiply by Delta T and we find that Delta X out as measured by the Earth.

165
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:29.270
It is equal to the relative times Delta T out as measured by the Earth.

166
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:39.110
OK, so if we take all this literally plug and chug, we know a relative is just zero point eight C.

167
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.030
And ultimately, out of the Earth is just one point sixty seven.

168
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.750
Hours.

169
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:55.740
And we get sort of a convenient measurement for distance in special relativity, which you may or may

170
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.600
not have seen previously.

171
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.910
So what we get is we get this value.

172
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:03.780
We plug this into our calculator and keep this see out.

173
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.060
We get a 1.3 for.

174
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.870
I'm going to call light hours.

175
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:20.960
And I'll explain a second or in other words, this is sort of like three times ours.

176
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:21.860
All right.

177
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:22.460
So.

178
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:29.770
You probably heard the term light here, and that is basically the distance light travels in one year,

179
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.150
but a light hour is the distance like travels in one hour.

180
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.060
And why this is convenient, I'll show you in a second.

181
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:41.680
But what we're really doing is we're just saying we're checking the speed of light photons times by

182
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.250
tea that has to equal Delta X. We call it a light hour.

183
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:52.000
OK, now the reason why this is useful, I'm going to show you in the next step in solving this problem.

184
00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.180
So what we have is we have this guy here.

185
00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:00.340
We figured out the distance it has traveled out as measured by Earth.

186
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.580
And what we need to do is we need to figure out how long it takes for like to travel this distance all

187
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.630
the way back to the Earth.

188
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:15.360
OK, because we're already in the reference frame so we can take this kinematic or relationship and

189
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.500
literally just manipulate it to get the unknown quantity that we want.

190
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.750
So we know that the speed of light.

191
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.270
All right.

192
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:30.830
It's going to be the total distance of travels, which would be Delta X out Earth.

193
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:40.010
And we want to figure out the time over which that occurs, so that's really going to be Delta T back

194
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.890
as measured by the Earth.

195
00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:49.250
OK, so we want to figure out this delta city back using this ultimate speed, which is a bit faster

196
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:50.360
than our relative speed.

197
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.920
So if we want to get this guy, you want to isolate this guy.

198
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.340
All we have to do is something very similar and then plug in Chuck.

199
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.500
So we just divide by C, multiply by Delta C, and we figure out that Delta T back.

200
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.440
As measured by Earth.

201
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.940
Is equal to.

202
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.580
Not ex out and sorry, I'm sort of slanting my writing here.

203
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:20.820
Not x out as measured by the Earth, divided by sea.

204
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.640
And you can see the magic here and using these units, because if we literally plug in Chuck, we got

205
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.630
that value right there.

206
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.850
We get a 1.3 for.

207
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.120
Like our or that three times ours.

208
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:45.140
We divide by sea, and when we end up with is this guy cancels out of the sea and we end up with ours.

209
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.020
So it's convenient.

210
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:51.750
We're taking basically this equation translating into units and then we divide by sea.

211
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:58.800
It knocks out that guy the sea term, and it's very quick, easy, efficient calculation, OK?

212
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:04.260
So we're going to see that units in special relativity, we come up with multiple units that are a bit

213
00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:05.820
different than what you've seen previously.

214
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.600
And it's going to drive the analysis, drive your problem solving to make your life easier.

215
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:11.550
That's a good thing, right?

216
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.190
You should be very, very happy about that, right?

217
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.700
Because it could get much more complicated as we'll see later in the course.

218
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:18.660
So when we get.

219
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.970
Miscalculation into our calculator, we figure out it's one point three, four hours.

220
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.470
That's Delta T back as measured by the Earth.

221
00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:41.610
And what we really want this problem is how long out the rock is up to the signal arrive back on Earth.

222
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:47.520
OK, so we want the total time after it shoots off here it comes over here.

223
00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.160
We know that after that happens, it's one point six seven hours that it shoots some light that comes

224
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.610
back.

225
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.520
That's going to be one point three four hours.

226
00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.920
So all we need to know is the total time.

227
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.560
And it's turtle time is going to be Delta T out.

228
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.080
Not out as measured by the Earth.

229
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.330
Plus, Delta C back.

230
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.190
As measured by the Earth, so I'm just going to put it there.

231
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:27.250
They're running out of board space here, so we know from Part A. that the time it takes to get out

232
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.850
before it sends a signal is one point sixty seven.

233
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:42.590
Hours and then we want to add the time it takes to get back, which is one point three four hours.

234
00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.480
So when we do that calculation, you could just do it on top of your head.

235
00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.120
You're good at your arithmetic.

236
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:54.020
We get up, get a value of three hours.

237
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.720
Since it leaves, that's when we would hear back.

238
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.640
And that is the answer to Part B.
