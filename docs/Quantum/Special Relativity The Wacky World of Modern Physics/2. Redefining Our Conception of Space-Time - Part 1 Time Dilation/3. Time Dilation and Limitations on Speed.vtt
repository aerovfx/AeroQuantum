1
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.320
OK, so we've just gone through the painful process of carrying out this convoluted experiment.

2
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.420
What did we discover?

3
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.630
What we have found is that by accounting for the fact or the second postulate a special relativity,

4
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.610
that light is always going to be a constant regardless of your reference frame.

5
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:46.310
We found that the time elapsed by two events in different inertial reference frames are not the same.

6
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:53.060
That time is going to flow in a different manner compared to observer and observer B if they are in

7
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.900
different inertial reference frames.

8
00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.790
OK, so we have identified that it's different, but we don't know how the effect transpires, how it

9
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.350
comes into play, right?

10
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.920
Does it differ by a lot?

11
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.200
Does it differ by a little bit?

12
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.050
Which one is running faster?

13
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.290
Which one is running slower?

14
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.840
So let's explore what we have just discovered and try and figure out if we can pinpoint the type of

15
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.080
behavior that we're going to observe between these reference frames.

16
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.320
So again, we found that Delta T or the time as observed by somebody in the S reference frame on Earth

17
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.560
is equal to this Lorentz factor gamma times, delta t prime or the time measured by the person in the

18
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.540
moving reference frame, Terence.

19
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.130
Now what we want to do is we want to plot up this Lorenz factor here and see what kind of values we

20
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:49.540
get, see how it behaves for different values of relative velocities or this guy right here in the Bay

21
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.650
Area and see what we could find.

22
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.440
Okay, so if we do that, you know, you could plop it in MATLAB, plop it in Mathematica, use Wolfram

23
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.270
Alpha, use whatever you want to use.

24
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.320
We get the following OK, so we have this curve here.

25
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.690
We see that gamma is pretty small and it's pretty small for a lot of ranges of beta.

26
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.880
Once we hit 0.5 tabular values here, it's only one point one five times the moving reference frames

27
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.390
time.

28
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.810
That's not a big increase in time, but what we found here is that regardless of what value we have,

29
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.550
gamma is always greater than one, and it tends to go to infinity when beta gets large.

30
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.170
So, you know, initially at these small ranges, the low point eight six six six.

31
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.180
You know, we're close to one.

32
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.360
There's not much of a change and then above that, oh, it blows up or we start getting these awesome

33
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.770
effects coming into play here.

34
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.620
And that's where it's it's bound by infinity.

35
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.390
And what I'm going to say is that relativistic effects are most constraints in this region, that this

36
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.920
range are pointing to.

37
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.990
This, which corresponds to a value of two as tabulated here starts to blow up.

38
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.110
We get really close to the speed of light point nine nine nine nine five or I'm going to say that again

39
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.360
point nine nine nine nine five.

40
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.770
The time difference is we have a factor here.

41
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.540
So in a table we're finding is that time or the Lawrence factor is bounded between one an affinity.

42
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.810
And it's always a positive value, so the time that it's observed on Earth is always larger than the

43
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.180
time as observed in the moving reference frame.

44
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.490
That's what this equation is telling us, right?

45
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.060
So the implied effect we just discovered.

46
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.840
We're going to call it time dilation, as I say, and finish a lot of the time.

47
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.480
The names we give to confess the names we give to ideas dictate the behavior of the phenomenon that's

48
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.460
taking place dilation.

49
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.820
Think of dilation of your eyeballs.

50
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.490
It means getting bigger, getting larger.

51
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.320
So the time is getting bigger as observed by somebody on Earth, as observed by the stationary or observing

52
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.860
entity.

53
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:19.490
And it also means that a moving clock the clock in the moving round has been in the space ship is observed

54
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.000
to move slow the observed very slow.

55
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.090
What do I mean by that?

56
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.100
Let's let's observe that.

57
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.120
So when this happens, let's say that Terence is going actually at point eight, six, six times the

58
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.960
speed of light.

59
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.050
So we get a bit of pointing fix this, and that's why it is so useful because we don't have to Ulysses.

60
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.050
We just get this relative factor.

61
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.150
Let's say it's going at that speed of light.

62
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.570
And Terence says, Hey, this took 10 minutes, this to happen.

63
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.830
Of course, that wouldn't happen.

64
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.040
But just for this circumstance to express what is going on in this relationship, he says it takes 10

65
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.870
minutes for the light to go up and come down.

66
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.990
You know, my light was lazy in this this situation.

67
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.740
Philip, what do you get he does this calculation, he's like, Oh my God, that's why his face is so

68
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.100
big.

69
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.200
He says, Well, this relation we just discovered it's this beta is poisonous.

70
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.730
Snakes are gamma.

71
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.670
It's going to be too.

72
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.390
If it took 10 minutes for you.

73
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.540
You know what, it took 20 minutes for me.

74
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.050
Wow, that's crazy.

75
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.570
That's crazy.

76
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:36.290
This is this seems so unconventional, it seems so just take a slap in the face of our general wisdom,

77
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.170
our general intuition, because this never happens quite often.

78
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.080
Like, who disagrees about time?

79
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.710
Hardly anybody.

80
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.990
Hardly anybody.

81
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:57.550
But the reason why this doesn't crop up in every like every day events is because this guy is like flat.

82
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.980
Look at it.

83
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.640
It's flat.

84
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.920
It has to do with the equation here.

85
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.550
The gamma level risk factor is about one until two we go point five times the speed of light point five

86
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.110
times three times 10 to the eight meters per second.

87
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.850
That's 1.5 times 10 to the eight meters per second.

88
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.610
That's when we only get a relativistic factor of one point one, five five.

89
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.010
So in other words?

90
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.340
In everyday situations, this is not observable.

91
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.450
It does not arise.

92
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.030
It's hidden beneath layers.

93
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.710
And that's why I say here, when there's is much less than see beat is approximately zero and gamma

94
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.510
is about equal to one, right?

95
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.940
We don't get relativistic effects.

96
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.940
That's why the Galilean transformation.

97
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.530
When Bill up in Terence did their experiment.

98
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.520
That's why their observations, their time lined up.

99
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.990
It wasn't different.

100
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.340
Right?

101
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.630
Because this relativistic effect did not crop up.

102
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.800
It only arises when we travel close to the speed of light.

103
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.340
And that's why it feels so unintuitive.

104
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:19.600
That's why it spits in the face of everything we know about the universe in physics.

105
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.830
Right.

106
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.040
It's a very weird idea.

107
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.630
And if it's hard to accept that time dilation.

108
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.230
It's something that happens.

109
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:36.090
Just remember, this is a consequence of an observation we found that the speed of light is constant

110
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.920
because we're a reference frame which we have tested again and again and again.

111
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.720
OK, so there's one other cool effect that's hidden and what we've just discovered.

112
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.880
We take this guy here.

113
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.360
We know that if we divide by a number, we cannot divide by zero.

114
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.970
So what's hidden in here?

115
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.580
Well, we cannot divide by zero.

116
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.450
And we also cannot have negative numbers under the square root.

117
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.050
Right.

118
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.200
So that means that a beat is greater than one, we get a negative number.

119
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.550
We get imaginary numbers.

120
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.200
We got an imaginary time.

121
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:18.530
We don't deal with imaginary numbers in physical quantities, right?

122
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.590
Nature is nice.

123
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.600
It behaves pretty well for the most part.

124
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.540
So Peter here cannot be less than one.

125
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.820
So what I'm saying and what I just ran through my mind, I'll spell it out.

126
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.540
In terms of this, I say, oh, one minus beta squared.

127
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.570
This guy has to be greater than zero.

128
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.450
So we bring Beta Square there to the square root that doesn't change much.

129
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.130
You get.

130
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.920
PETA or.

131
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.730
I'll make a match up for you guys you get.

132
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.080
Beta.

133
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:03.560
Is less than one.

134
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:04.640
OK.

135
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.850
What does that tell us right here?

136
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.520
Basically, this guy is less than one.

137
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:13.930
This guy.

138
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.100
It's less than one, which means.

139
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.200
That.

140
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:20.820
They.

141
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:29.910
Is less than sea, right, and this is why you've probably heard maybe it's sci fi, maybe somewhere

142
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:37.530
else that the speed of light beam, not the speed of light, the speed of anything in the universe cannot

143
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.960
exceed the speed of light.

144
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.720
We see this a set of tonic particles.

145
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:48.330
We see this in CERN when they're doing their particle acceleration experiments.

146
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.700
Nothing can exceed the speed of light.

147
00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:57.570
This is a cap on the limit of speed imposed by the universe, and it is 100 percent real.

148
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:58.440
This is not fictional.

149
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.360
This is a real effect that we observe.

150
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:01.740
OK.

151
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.660
A time violation, I want to make it clear time dilation is an observable fact.

152
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.590
OK, this is something that you're going to see, no matter what it's going to arise.

153
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.830
If you've seen the movie Interstellar and this is a different relativistic effect, but it's similar.

154
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.940
You may remember that the individuals in the spaceship, they went down to that planet with heavy gravity,

155
00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.030
with a huge waves, and they came back up.

156
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.150
They were it's a different effect.

157
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:37.840
It's more in terms of general relativity, which we won't get into, but the time time had to bend to

158
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.190
account for these ideas.

159
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:45.820
Space time bends to correct and account for the second part of a special relativity.

160
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.800
That's what's giving rise to all this stuff.

161
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.420
That's what's given rise to this.
