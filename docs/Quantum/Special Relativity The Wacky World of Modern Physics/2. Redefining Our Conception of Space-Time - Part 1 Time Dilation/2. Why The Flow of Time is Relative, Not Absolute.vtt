1
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.520
Now, this guy here, we want to take a look at this after the experiment of tents and fill up.

2
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.690
They were crushed.

3
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.610
They were like, What the hell is going on?

4
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.870
We had discovered this nice transformation, this galley and transformation.

5
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.710
It dictates that if we shoot a laser in a moving reference frame, the person who is stationary should

6
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.290
observe that the velocity of that light is the velocity of the spaceship, plus the velocity of the

7
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.590
light.

8
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.050
But that was not the case, though.

9
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.220
They said, Well, I take a step back.

10
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.220
I need to observe what is going on in the universe.

11
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.460
I need to analyze the assumptions I made and try to understand the phenomena that is transpiring in

12
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.880
front of me.

13
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.230
Remember, again, we do not prescribe how the universe should behave.

14
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.100
Rather, we observe what occurs in front of us.

15
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:17.060
Study it and take what we can extract from that observations to develop theories which help to guide

16
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.200
us and allow us to predict how things are going to happen in the future.

17
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.850
That's how good science is done.

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.440
That's how good physics is done.

19
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.430
And this is what Terrance and Phillip want to do to try to correct their errors that they observed by

20
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.950
not accounting for postulate number two.

21
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.250
OK, so what did they do?

22
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.120
What kind of assumptions did they make in their initial experiment?

23
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.990
Well, one assumption they made is we're going to write out here is that if you have this very fast

24
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.430
reference frame a spaceship, if you will, and it has a clock and somebody stationary has a clock,

25
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.020
you sync them up right when the referee starts to move.

26
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:08.360
What they asserted is that the time if I get the right marker, the time Delta T.

27
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.150
Is equal to Delta T Prime.

28
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.290
In essence, they asserted that time is constant regardless of your reverence.

29
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.210
It's absolute.

30
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.170
It's universal.

31
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.360
And in an everyday sense, that's something we take for granted, right?

32
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.960
If you give somebody a clock a smartphone, for example, they drive really fast in a car, you would

33
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.280
expect their conception of time to be the same as your conception of time.

34
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.100
But again, that's a limited snapshot of the full picture of reality of the full picture of the universe.

35
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.520
If you dig a bit further beneath the surface, you're going to discover that the universe behaves in

36
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.460
very odd ways as a consequence of accepting that the speed of light is constant.

37
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.660
OK, so we cannot assume this.

38
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.710
Let's not make this assumption again.

39
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.420
We're not going to prescribe how the universe should behave based upon what we expect.

40
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:11.050
Rather, we're going to take our notions of the universe, throw into the trash can and instead observe

41
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.530
and extract what we can from what we observe and develop.

42
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.740
Understanding from that a rich understanding of the universe.

43
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.930
OK, so what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to do another experiment.

44
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.600
Let's take a look at this assumption.

45
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.980
Transit Phillips say.

46
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.630
I do not like this assumption.

47
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.490
I'm trying to prescribe reality.

48
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.960
How reality should behave.

49
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.510
I learned I should not do that for my four year experiment.

50
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.800
Let's see if our conception of time is different.

51
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.070
If we account for this postulate, OK, so in order to take a look at how time flows, how their clocks

52
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.930
are going to tick, if you will.

53
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.310
Well, Terrance and Phillip, do they develop a new experiment?

54
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.100
They take their Star Wars ship from the previous experiment.

55
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.740
They take their laser beam and they say, OK.

56
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.300
Let's develop our conception of time based upon what we know is real.

57
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.440
We know that in any given second, any interval of time or between any two events that happen, the

58
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.750
speed of light is always going to be constant.

59
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.750
So let's try to develop our conception of time around that.

60
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.260
OK.

61
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.480
So what they do is they say, OK, I'm going to take that laser beam and I'm going to have the laser

62
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.040
beam, how a detector on it.

63
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.090
It's going to shoot a laser up to a mirror.

64
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.470
It's going to get reflected.

65
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.770
It's going to come back and then it's going to detect that light.

66
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.520
And based upon this machine, I can figure out how time is going to progress.

67
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.470
I can figure out the length of time between any two events.

68
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.950
Those are the keywords I want you to remember to events.

69
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.310
OK.

70
00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:00.980
So let me erase this top portion here, and then we can dive into how we're actually going to put this

71
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.490
experiment together and see the amazing results.

72
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.610
It's going to dive walls, which are going to have very weird consequences associated with them.

73
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.950
But those consequences arise as a fact or rather due to accepting that the speed of light is constant.

74
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:26.570
So we're going to have to reference frames the strengths which is attached to the Earth where we have

75
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.870
fill up and Terence is going to be in the ship.

76
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.340
He's going to ride again.

77
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.870
He's going to start the detection process where he shoots a flash of light.

78
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.330
That's the first event.

79
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.990
It gets reflected back.

80
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.940
And then when you detect it, when you detect that, that's the second event.

81
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.960
So if we're in the reference frame of Terence S. Prime, just explain why prime the coordinates and

82
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.090
he's he's flying at a very high speed point nine five times the speed of light.

83
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.170
We know that the flash of light and the detection of light are going to occur in the same place.

84
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.850
Or that seems plausible, right?

85
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.020
If you shoot a laser beam, it's a mirror and it comes back.

86
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.660
You have not moved your ex and your y of that event have remained constant.

87
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.980
Right?

88
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.800
So explain why prime and prime are not going to change between the flash of light and the detection

89
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.130
of light.

90
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.030
The light moves.

91
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.280
The detector remains stationary now at the same time.

92
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.560
We're going to have fill up.

93
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.670
He's going to stay on the Earth in a reference frame s with X and Y, and he's going to enlist his partner,

94
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.910
Eric, who's also going to assist with this.

95
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.810
And they're going to say that we're going to measure the same exact time between these two events.

96
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.580
I'm going to look at you as you shoot a flash of light through.

97
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.830
It's going to bounce off the mirror and when it comes back.

98
00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.510
I'm going to measure it, so.

99
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.610
This is it economy, this is a sense of asymmetry between the two.

100
00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.820
And this is evoked by design and special.

101
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.160
Keep that in mind in the reference frame.

102
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.750
S.

103
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:18.910
We need two people because the flash of light and the detection of light do not occur in the same place.

104
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.360
I'm going to say that again, the flash of light and the detection of light are not synonymous.

105
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.860
They do not occur in the same place.

106
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:35.440
So in order to streamline this effort, you can figure out if this guy, the spaceship is traveling

107
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.370
the relative at a constant speed.

108
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.890
Which is what we need through the possibilities of special relativity.

109
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:53.500
Point nine, five time see, we can space up Eric and fill up such that when the light is produced or

110
00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:03.520
it is detected there at the same exact place and they can stop their own clocks and compare times now.

111
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.110
In the moving reference frame, things are not super interesting.

112
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.070
We see tariffs is like, I'm going to examine time, I'm going to get this answer.

113
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.180
That's why he's happy.

114
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.520
That's why he's super excited.

115
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:24.560
And he says, Baby, my conception of time is just going to be the length.

116
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:35.370
Between the detector at the bottom and the mirror at the top, the Delta y prime, that's over the speed

117
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:35.790
of light.

118
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.890
OK, so what did I do here?

119
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:43.320
This is basically, you know, this is Delta Y Prime is equal to you.

120
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.430
See, Delta T Prime, OK?

121
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.730
It's prime because we're in the moving reference frame.

122
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.360
OK, so.

123
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.970
If we take this and we know that is the distance between these guys.

124
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.530
Well, this is just easy.

125
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:06.450
The other thing prime is no more than two times D or C, whoa, what I do there.

126
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.230
So we know that the light has to go up and then has to come back.

127
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.760
So that means, well, it's going up.

128
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:18.120
It traverses this distance D and then when it comes down, it's reverses back down a distance deep.

129
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.060
So we get two times this distance.

130
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.280
D, we know that the speed of light is.

131
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.290
Again, this is where you invoke the second posture a special relativity, and we're going to leave

132
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.740
that there.

133
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.980
So I'm going to put that as the very important result.

134
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.280
Little boring.

135
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.770
This is what we would observe every day on Earth if we did this experiment.

136
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.020
You know, Terrence does this and he's like, Oh, baby, I'm frickin happy.

137
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.420
Nothing has changed.

138
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.160
Maybe our conception of time is absolute.

139
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.540
Maybe what we assumed in our experiment is correct, and this is not the source of the problem.

140
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.770
Well, lo and behold, we go back to Earth and that reference frame.

141
00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.120
We have Eric and Phil up here and we're keeping track of this.

142
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.710
And what they say is that unlike Terrence, the light cannot go straight up.

143
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:05.610
Why?

144
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.470
Why can the light not go straight up?

145
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:10.110
Because if it did, it would go up.

146
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.790
This mirror would move to the right.

147
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.860
Oh, and it would miss the mirror.

148
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.600
It would not be reflected back.

149
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.240
So in order or rather, the light that is reflected back that is detected in order to get a detection,

150
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.020
rather, it must move at a slight angle here.

151
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:34.050
So Eric and Phillip, they see that the light has to go along this this distance here and then maybe

152
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.580
longer.

153
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:35.640
It may be shorter.

154
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:36.990
We don't know yet.

155
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:44.130
What we do know is that it's going to travel at the speed of light, and we could take the fact that

156
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:51.180
it has to move at this angle and we can do some cool geometry stuff, right?

157
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:51.900
Right.

158
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.770
We can extract some triangles and do all that trigonometry.

159
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:01.590
So if we do that, what we find is I'm going to use a different color.

160
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.720
We can say, Hey, wait a second here.

161
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:11.390
We're going to have this blue line here, and I'm going to redraw this offer here, I know it's it's

162
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.510
not the best picture.

163
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.380
Really at this triangle here.

164
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.350
And we could form two right triangles.

165
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:29.960
As follows, and we know that between Eric and fill up or the time in which the light is flashed and

166
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.220
the detection, we know that this whole guy, this guy.

167
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.750
This is going to be the.

168
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.820
Apathy, or V is B relative, we know that this is moving to the right at a constant speed.

169
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.180
So again, it's just what we did up here and writing this right.

170
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:58.600
Dr. X is equal to a v delta T, and we also know and again, let's back up.

171
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.890
I want to make sure you understand this.

172
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.810
Delta C What is Delta T?

173
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.880
Delta Thi is the time that is measured by Eric and Phil up on Earth.

174
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:13.630
The s reference frame and we know that when it goes up and comes back down, it transpires.

175
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.380
The time we're trying to measure, we want to compare Delta T.

176
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.840
Without the sea prime.

177
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.540
And see if this relation is true.

178
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.110
OK.

179
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:31.010
And we're doing that by measuring the time transpired at the time calculated with respect to a reference

180
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:31.430
frame.

181
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.710
Between these two events.

182
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:43.730
OK, so we have a. we know along this guy or, yeah, this this leg here, this has to be T, right?

183
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.180
This didn't change at all.

184
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.390
The distance between here, it can move as fast as a once that life is not changing in the y axis,

185
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.290
that's going to remain.

186
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:59.660
And we know that the length that light travels, it's going to be C Delta T, but to get up to the mirror

187
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.590
to get up here.

188
00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.900
That's half of the journey, right half of the journey.

189
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.910
So that should be Delta T over two.

190
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.810
Right, right.

191
00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:12.320
So this guy is described as the Delta T over two.

192
00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:20.300
OK, now if we take this fact when this reality and I extrapolate this triangle.

193
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.390
And draw a prettier picture.

194
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:31.140
What we get is this right triangle, we have d there now one.

195
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.430
One foot of this triangle is not going to up t.

196
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:41.220
Rather, we know that it takes half the time to go up and half the time to come back because we have

197
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.180
a kind of velocity.

198
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.860
So at the point of reflection, this is half of the journey, half of the trip.

199
00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:56.370
So this guy, this guy should be the hands of time that it transpires that it's just Delta T over two

200
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.430
again, from here to here is half a trip.

201
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.530
That's half of the time.

202
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:00.930
OK.

203
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.900
Same thing we did with this guy up here.

204
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.510
So if we take that and go like so.

205
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.830
We get this triangle here, and we could do some nice trigonometry.

206
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.350
OK.

207
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.540
We know that.

208
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.960
This squared using the Pythagorean theorem, baby is equal to this squared plus not squared.

209
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.580
So let's do that.

210
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.160
OK, so if we do see.

211
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.490
Delta T. Over to we square that guy.

212
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.190
The hypotenuse is equal to.

213
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:36.900
The.

214
00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.890
Delta T or two squared?

215
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.440
Plus, he squared.

216
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.100
All right.

217
00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.410
So you probably thinking why in the world could we do with this?

218
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.730
Is this pretty common?

219
00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.950
Well, let's massage the equation a bit and see what a divulges again.

220
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.170
We're taking what we observe a reality that light is constant and trying to extract the consequences

221
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:08.860
as a result of that not dictate how reality behaves, let it behave as it does observe it, study it,

222
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.200
extract understanding out that's what we're doing right here.

223
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:20.980
OK, so let's take these these squares here and see what happens so we can have c squared Delta T squared

224
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.000
over four.

225
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:29.570
I'm going to move this left minus v squared Delta T squared or four.

226
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.070
And that is going to be equal to d squared.

227
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:43.460
All right, now, we want to form some conception of time, so we might want to pull out a Delta T at

228
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.000
some point.

229
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.660
But I'm going to multiply by four and pull up a T here.

230
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:55.460
So we get Delta T squared is equal to C squared minus B squared.

231
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.440
And.

232
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.720
That is equal to for the square.

233
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.490
OK, so now I'm going to do something tricky.

234
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.610
I'm going to try to factor out the C squared.

235
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.480
And you're going to see why soon.

236
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:21.100
So what we're trying to do just to make sure you're on par with what we're doing and what the derivations

237
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.580
in the book are trying to do.

238
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.340
They don't usually get a lot of steps.

239
00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.560
We're trying to take this guy.

240
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.050
And compare it to this guy.

241
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:38.270
So in order to get some kind of relation, we need this guy to pop out in this equation somehow.

242
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.230
So we're going to need a driver to d oversee, OK?

243
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:48.170
We see this if you take a square root here that gives us two d, so we need that extra C, and that's

244
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.670
why I'm factoring this guy up.

245
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.060
OK.

246
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.220
So what we get is Delta C squared.

247
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:07.190
C squared on one minus the quantity the obasi squared is equal to for the squared.

248
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:08.270
All right.

249
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:13.370
So this guy is going to be important as second, because this sort of like your relative speed relative

250
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.270
to the speed of light.

251
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.730
But we'll get there eventually.

252
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.410
Now we want to do is take the square root and we end up with.

253
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.380
I'm also going to divide by D.

254
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.610
OK, so we get Delta T the time as measured on Earth.

255
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:35.190
If I multiply by the square root.

256
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.560
One might just be overseen.

257
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:46.620
This quantity squared that's going to be equal to two D.

258
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.920
Oversee.

259
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.730
Now you're probably seeing this this connection, and you're probably like, Oh.

260
00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:03.290
This is way in which Terrance and Phillip can relate their time such that we get this universal, absolute

261
00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:04.010
conception.

262
00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.470
Between the two reference frames, right?

263
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:12.540
We're trying to compare the phenomena and see if it matches up, we can tell right now it doesn't,

264
00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.420
which means that some weird relative is relativistic effects arise.

265
00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.880
OK, so we want to take this.

266
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:25.060
And realize that we could just throw that baby right in there.

267
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.620
And what we get is that we get the important results.

268
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:33.300
Delta team.

269
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:35.790
Is equal to.

270
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:47.100
If we divide this one over the square root one minus V or C quantity squared.

271
00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.410
And Delta T pry.

272
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.170
Whew, that looks interesting.

273
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.610
Now we're going to simplify this a bit further.

274
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:08.040
I'm going to say that we got a lot of stuff going on here, a lot of stuff going on.

275
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:14.580
So I'm going to try to factor this guy out and I'm going to say this is like.

276
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:24.870
Delta T is equal to one over the square root of one minus beta squared, where beta is VRC, that's

277
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:29.130
the relativistic speed relative to the speed of light.

278
00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.070
And Deputy Prime.

279
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.470
And then.

280
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.840
We're going to say.

281
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.760
Rice, this guy.

282
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.140
We're going to put Delta T.

283
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.750
Prime.

284
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.590
And what I'm going to assert is that we can simplify this a bit more.

285
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.950
We're going to call it Delta T is equal to Janna.

286
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:15.360
I'm Delta T, right, where gamma is equal to one over the square root of one minus beta squared.

287
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.800
And Theta is equal to be over.

288
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.760
See?

289
00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:23.590
All right.

290
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.410
So.

291
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.560
We got this result.

292
00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.780
What exactly does it mean?

293
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.640
It's one thing to do physics.

294
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.930
It's one thing to do math.

295
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:40.070
But the real physics is hidden beneath the layers beneath the interpretation of the results you get.

296
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.020
So what in the world is this telling?

297
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.370
If this is telling us a very interesting thing and this is why Philip is freaking out, he's like,

298
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:51.200
Oh my God, what did I just figure out what in the world?

299
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.800
And you know, Eric is just stupid over here.

300
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:54.560
He's just smiling.

301
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.280
Still, he's like, what?

302
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.770
But anyway, he's just helping with the experiment.

303
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.430
He's a lab rat.

304
00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.460
What we just discovered is that.

305
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:09.910
The time of these events are flashing a light and detecting the lights on the rocket as observed as

306
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.920
observed by somebody in reference frame s.

307
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:16.610
Or fill and Eric.

308
00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.490
That time.

309
00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.150
Is different, it's different than the time observed by Terrence.

310
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.400
Whoa, wait a second.

311
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.580
Where this is really weird, right?

312
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:35.500
In everyday language, everyday observations, this is something that would not easily arise, right?

313
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.290
Time is time.

314
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.190
It flows at a constant rate.

315
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.090
However, remember what I said?

316
00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.450
Our Newtonian perspective of reality is limited.

317
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.480
It's a limited snapshot of a bigger picture.

318
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:54.870
If you dive beneath the surface and start analyzing the universe at different situations, we're rather

319
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.430
in different circumstances.

320
00:21:56.610 --> 00:22:04.800
What you find is that special ideas arise, and this really is a consequence of accepting the fact which

321
00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.260
we have observed through many, many experiments.

322
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:09.540
That light is is constant, right?

323
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:16.320
The consequence that arises is that the flow of time is different from different observers.

324
00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:17.310
All right.

325
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:25.310
And what I'm going to say is this factor here is the factor that determines how it's different and it's

326
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.380
a function of the speed of that reference plane.

327
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.970
A reference frame, OK.

328
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.180
So this guy is known as a Lorenz factor.

329
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:42.080
And what we're going to do next is we're going to take a look at how this changes our conception of

330
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:42.650
reality.

331
00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.810
What other consequences it has.

332
00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.420
And some other interesting ideas.

333
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.350
Stay tuned.
