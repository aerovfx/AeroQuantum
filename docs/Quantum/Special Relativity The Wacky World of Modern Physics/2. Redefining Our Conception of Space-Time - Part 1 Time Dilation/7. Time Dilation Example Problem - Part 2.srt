1
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,300
All right, for the final part of this problem, in part, see what we're going to do is we're going

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,050
to consider a more challenging question because I consider the first few parts pretty straightforward.

3
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,910
We're just taking our ideas, taking the concepts and we're labeling things, identifying things and

4
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,770
then plugging and chugging.

5
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,380
But in this part, we're going to mix it up a bit.

6
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm going to challenge you a bit and show you that, yes, relativity is weird.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,660
It's wacky, and some challenging ideas can crop up.

8
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,170
There really force you to think hard about what's going on in front of you, OK?

9
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:59,260
So for this problem, which is going to be labeled part, see what it states is the phone, it says,

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,240
according to the rocket clock.

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,490
How long after it left did the signal arrive back at Earth?

12
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,250
Now, if you took what we did initially, you said, Oh, I know the proper time of the rocket, I know

13
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,850
the Earth.

14
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm living going to use my delta to eagles gamma times, Delta T not equation.

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,610
And then I'm just going to calculate what I need, and that's going to give you the right answer.

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:29,440
And if you go down that path without paving that path to success, correctly labeling things, questioning

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,940
things, thinking before you act, you would end up with the wrong answer.

18
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:34,990
What am I talking about?

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:42,100
To illustrate this, what I'm going to do is I'm going to solve the problem without any governing equation.

20
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:50,110
You had an answer and then show how we can get that quicker using time dilation if if we identify things

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,100
properly, right?

22
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,770
So it's important to think about these things before you jump, dive straight into the problem and start

23
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:57,880
chugging along.

24
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,300
OK.

25
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:04,360
So what we're going to do when we read this, we know that we're in the rocket's reference frame because

26
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,610
we're doing this according to the rocket clock.

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,880
And what we want to try and find out is the total time again.

28
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,760
But with respect to the rocket, what is it?

29
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,230
What does it determine in order to really get the correct result?

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,770
We need to question what's happening in that reference frame.

31
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,730
So let's do a thought experiment just like Einstein himself.

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,090
OK.

33
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,960
So according to the rocket, what's going on, going for the rocket?

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,640
If you're in the rock and you're standing still, looks like you're not moving, and everything outside

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,710
of your window is moving past you.

36
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,000
You look back behind you and you say, Oh, look, look at the Earth, man.

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,750
The Earth are not moving because there is no acceleration that could dictate that I am moving.

38
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,880
Remember the first part of the special relativity?

39
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,340
What I see is that I'm stationary.

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,040
I've been standing in this rocket ship all my life.

41
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:03,000
But what I do observe from my vantage point is that the Earth is actually moving back at a speed the

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,250
relative equal to zero point eight C.

43
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,370
And if we recognize this fact in this reference frame, we will get the correct result.

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,550
OK, so let's take that and let's try and figure out what's going on with all using our time dilation

45
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,030
equation.

46
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:19,930
OK.

47
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,860
So from this vantage point, what we know is that.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,760
I I spit out from the Earth, and after one hour, I send a signal back.

49
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,500
So know I know the time from launch to sending of a signal.

50
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:42,940
What I really need to figure out is how long it takes after I send the signal to get back to Earth in

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,690
order to do that.

52
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,160
I can use similar ideas that are used in Part B, right?

53
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:47,710
What do we do?

54
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,290
We used kinematics.

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,300
We said V is equal to Delta X over Delta T.

56
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,680
Let's use that.

57
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,970
But in this case, we now remember we are in the rocket frame.

58
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:05,320
We want our ex to figure out how experiences arise and transpire from our perspective.

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,130
Right.

60
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,110
So in order to do that, what we really have to do is we need to figure out the distance this guy has

61
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,590
traveled initially, right when it sends a signal.

62
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,630
So according to this guy, according to the rocket, we say, Oh, well.

63
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,920
The physical laws rise in different reference frames in the same manner, so we know that, you know,

64
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,530
the Earth would say the relative is equal to Delta X and we're going to call this Delta X out.

65
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,170
All the rocket I'll put in are here, and that's going to be all the time I measure in my reference

66
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:43,530
frame.

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,020
This is going to be at T out, according to the rocket.

68
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,090
And we just need to find out unknown.

69
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,540
We know this guy that is just this.

70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,190
You know, Delta T out are one hour.

71
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,190
We to isolate Delta X, so Delta X.

72
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,030
The distance we have traveled, according to the rocket, is equal to the relative times Delta three

73
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,300
out, according to the rocket.

74
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,240
Now we need to do is plug in shock.

75
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,890
We put in our relative velocity.

76
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,450
The delta time out is one hour and again we use our new units.

77
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,990
So this is just an easy calculation.

78
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,450
This is it's almost mindless right here, right?

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:41,890
So this becomes zero point eight light hours or, as I just said, it's three times the units in hours.

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,890
So we got this this calculation here.

81
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,770
We're getting some more information.

82
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,380
We're getting closer to the answer.

83
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,740
Next, we need to figure out, OK, when I fire that signal.

84
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,600
How far does the light have to trap now based upon Part B?

85
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,430
You may want to think, Oh, well, I shoot the signal and has to go the distance that I traveled,

86
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,640
right?

87
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,640
It has to go the distance that I travel.

88
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:15,210
But experiences arise based upon your perspective, your perspective to find your experience right.

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,180
So according to the rocket, what I see is that this guy, I'm stationary and the Earth is going to

90
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:21,690
the left.

91
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,810
So to get back to the Earth, I need to chase the Earth, according to me and the rocket.

92
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:35,130
So what happens is we have to go the same distance belt acts that I originally traveled, but the Earth

93
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,510
is going to go another distance.

94
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,790
So the total distance I really have to travel really is going to be Delta X.

95
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,070
Out, according to the rocket.

96
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,990
Well, sadly, just as the Earth travels, right?

97
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,760
So that's going to be very relative.

98
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,220
Times Delta T back in time, it takes to get back to Earth.

99
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,340
As measured by the rocket, because we're in the rocket reference frame, so this is going to get me

100
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,230
a distance, and again, this is just the Eagles, Delta X and the Delta T multiply the depth to the

101
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,280
B to get Delta X.

102
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,760
So this should give us, well, the distance, the White House, the travel.

103
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,630
So if we're trying to figure out the light.

104
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,420
Well, that's just, you know, see times Delta T gives us the distance light travels, right?

105
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,940
So this is just the novelty at the same time interval.

106
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,120
We're trying to find relative to the rocket.

107
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,090
OK, so that makes sense, right?

108
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:38,720
Because from.

109
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,630
That reference frame the Earth is moving to the left, so has to travel an additional distance to get

110
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,350
back to the Earth.

111
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,290
OK, so.

112
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:59,280
What happens is we need to isolate this Delta T back R, and when we do that, we just plug in shocking

113
00:07:59,280 --> 00:07:59,670
assets.

114
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,100
So in order to do that?

115
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:13,530
We bring this guy over here, and we find that Delta X out R is equal to Delta T.

116
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,510
Back.

117
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,040
Are.

118
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,780
Times the relative.

119
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,990
Or rather time, see?

120
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,150
Minus, this guy actually brought it over.

121
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:34,900
As such, and then we find that if we flip this guy over, I like having my very all the less, not

122
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,340
sure why, but it makes me feel comfortable.

123
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,400
We had Delta T back.

124
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,530
Ah, and that is equal to Delta X out.

125
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:54,290
Divided by sea minus feral and all we need to do now is literally plug and shut.

126
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,600
So Delta X out, ah, it's going to be zero point eight light.

127
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,030
Hours or see times, hours.

128
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,900
And then we have C minus 0.8 C, OK, well, we know right off the bat seas are going to pop out is

129
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,740
going to cancel.

130
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,820
So we're going to get to a time on the top.

131
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,230
This is what we're looking for.

132
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,580
We got what we wanted.

133
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,290
So it's basically like zero point eight over zero point two.

134
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,870
And when we do that calculation.

135
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,620
It's basically what is that 0.8 times five?

136
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,670
Which is just for.

137
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,500
So we get a Delta C that.

138
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,780
Are.

139
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,700
Is equal to four hours.

140
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:06,690
And again, that's the beauty of our selected unit notation and find the total time back.

141
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:20,570
This is literally just the altered T out, according to the rocket, was Delta T back.

142
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,890
According to the rocket, we have the Delta T out, that's one hour plus Delta T back.

143
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,270
That's four hours.

144
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,590
We end up with a total of five hours.

145
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,230
Now we get this and compare it.

146
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,110
To that on Earth, and I want you to find the glaring contradiction here.

147
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,240
Why should you be confused?

148
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,010
Why should you be confused?

149
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,050
Because, well, wait a second.

150
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,990
In part a we said the rocket is the proper time based upon us analysis here.

151
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,280
The rock is the proper time, so the time on Earth should be dilated, which means that the time on

152
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,400
Earth should be larger than the time as measured by the Rock.

153
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,960
Oh, wait a minute.

154
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,940
This total time, five hours larger than that on Earth.

155
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:17,530
Did I make a mistake?

156
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,910
Did I make a mistake?

157
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,740
What's going on here?

158
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:30,970
Well, I want to say and why I think this problem is very good is that no, no, no, no, we did not

159
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:31,750
make a mistake.

160
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,760
This is what would happen according to the a reference frame.

161
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:44,260
And we accounted for all phenomena that the person on the rocket would actually measure.

162
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,950
So what's going on here?

163
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,920
What I'm going to do is I'm going to write this up really quick.

164
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,210
We don't lose that.

165
00:11:53,570 --> 00:12:01,400
So we have total time of the rocket, five hours.

166
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,600
All right.

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,290
That's sort of my my box up here of the results we can keep track.

168
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:12,050
Remember, counting very important and any kind of physics discipline.

169
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,010
If that's true, what what in the world happened?

170
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,720
Were we wrong apart?

171
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,890
No, we were right in part A and we are right Morsi.

172
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,740
And this is sort of why I see the time dilation equation for the last because we're going to work through

173
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,800
this again, using time relation and what we want to do.

174
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,860
We want to do the same exact thing we were doing previously.

175
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,880
So previously we were looking at the time interval.

176
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:48,620
Between when the rocket goes off, shoots off and when it's sent, and in that instance, event one

177
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,340
and event two in the rocket's reference frame occur at the same place.

178
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,650
So it looks like when they occur, you're at rest, right, taking off and sending a signal.

179
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,740
It's not if they're in the same place, but in part, see something weird is happening.

180
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,870
We're not looking at the same events.

181
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,790
We're not looking at the same events.

182
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,960
We're asking how long after it left?

183
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,790
The signal arrived back at Earth, so event one is again, that's leaving the Earth for.

184
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,250
But Event two is.

185
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,460
Arriving

186
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,570
at her.

187
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,190
Which is much different than what we did in part see.

188
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,970
So what I said is that the proper time occurs in the reference frame where the events are synonymous,

189
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,230
they occur in the same place.

190
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,870
Well, looking at these two reference frames, for part, see where does that occur?

191
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,430
Obviously, it occurs in the Earth.

192
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:59,510
It occurs in the Earth because when it takes off, you can stand on the the launch site.

193
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,620
You see it go off.

194
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,660
All right, you're in the the station where you're monitoring stuff and then when you receive the signal

195
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,610
by the same station, you're just sitting there.

196
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,910
So you've been at rest at these two events.

197
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,280
And for this question?

198
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,370
The proper time.

199
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,560
Is the Earth?

200
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,670
So I know what you're thinking.

201
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,530
Oh, wait a minute, that's confusing.

202
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,800
And this is why you need to build your intuition, practice some of the problems I give you and try

203
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,730
to use this format.

204
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,400
Try to keep a count of things and think about the reference frames.

205
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,060
Think about is my proper time changing words at the same.

206
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,660
If you can keep track of this and keep track of everything and then use our conventions.

207
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,680
That's how you pave a path for success.

208
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,290
OK, and this should not be surprising, because even when we run through the example, I said, you

209
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,490
know, the guy that's moving.

210
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,010
Are the people on the Earth?

211
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,380
I believe it was Phillip and Eric.

212
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,640
Their time was being dilating because proper time was the time on the rocket, but according to the

213
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,040
rocket, it looked like the Earth was moving.

214
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,350
So from his vantage point, it looked like time was dilating to him.

215
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,320
So we got the reverse effect and I told you there was sort of a symmetry, an asymmetry built into the

216
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,100
problem, right?

217
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,020
So this is the reverse effect.

218
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,610
This is the other side.

219
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,210
This is what arises according to the experience of somebody in the rocket.

220
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:35,640
OK, so according to this, our notion changed because we changed the events and now the proper time

221
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,380
is as measured on Earth.

222
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,280
All right.

223
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,370
And sort of throw a mark going to go crazy.

224
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,450
It's making me make me go crazy all this wacky special relativity.

225
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,260
So.

226
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,340
In order to get the right yourself, right, we could have taken our results from Part B and we could

227
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,780
have said, Oh, well, yeah, I'm awesome.

228
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,150
I could keep track of my stuff.

229
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,990
I'm going to write up my equation.

230
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:58,850
Delta C.

231
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:00,710
Total.

232
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:08,280
Is equal to gamma delta T, nor not total.

233
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,550
We say, Oh, wait a minute, I found out at the proper time is Earth.

234
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,050
This guy is going to be here.

235
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,190
This guy is going to be boom.

236
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,970
Seems like we're getting that result.

237
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,040
Rocket is dilated.

238
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,140
Let's see what happens.

239
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,930
Let's see what happens.

240
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,210
So all we need is just one job, right, baby.

241
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,230
So we get our Lorentz factor, which is one of the square root of one minus B or C squared as just one

242
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,140
minus 0.8 C divided by C.

243
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,630
We square this term and we multiply by Delta T, not total.

244
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,310
So that's three hours there.

245
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,190
We do this calculation.

246
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,450
What you will find.

247
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,190
Is that?

248
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,870
So you get a result.

249
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,340
Which is the following.

250
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,170
Bam.

251
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,680
They match up.

252
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,080
OK, so what do we learn, what do we learn?

253
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,490
We learned that, yes, special relativity is weird on effects arise, but.

254
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,730
If you study them.

255
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,710
And you keep track of reference frames.

256
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:36,160
What is proper time, you think through the problem instead of rushing through and just throwing numbers

257
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,630
in without thinking you will pave a path towards success?

258
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,980
Hope you enjoyed that video.

259
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,570
Hope you enjoy the example.

260
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,410
I hope part.

261
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,670
See really challenged you.

262
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,960
Make sure you understand this.

263
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,820
Make sure you understand what I did.

264
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,020
And if you don't go back and try to work through the math.

265
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:03,560
But next, what I want you to do is run through our example problems and then I'll join you next as

266
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,660
we take a look at another relativistic effect or sort of popped out sort of in Part B.

267
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,030
So keep that in the back of your mind that you know that life, according to the rocket and the light,

268
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,890
the queen, the Earth, it seems like they might not match up.

269
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,500
Oh, what's going on there?

270
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,520
Stay tuned.

271
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,320
I'm going to answer that shortly.
