1
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,700
I want to talk about one more thing, and I'm going to talk about how we actually proved this different

2
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,370
experiments we've done to show that, you know, this weird, wacky idea is true, that it really happens.

3
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,870
And what I want to say is that built into this experiment, by design, by design, there's a sort of

4
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,550
an asymmetry at play here.

5
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,100
And I did this on purpose.

6
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:46,100
So you may have heard when I was explaining this experiment outlined right here that I want you to pay

7
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,250
attention to the events that happen here.

8
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,910
What I said is that in the moving reference frame, the two events the flash of light and the detection

9
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,220
of light from which we're measuring time.

10
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:57,930
They are synonymous.

11
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,200
They happen in the same place, two events are synonymous.

12
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,810
However, in this reference frame.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,600
It doesn't have the same kind of symmetry.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,770
This guy and this guy, we need two people in different locations.

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,530
The events have to take place at different spots.

16
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,950
One is that x one y one, the other one is that x to y two.

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,310
And X1 and X2 do not equal each other.

18
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:29,870
This is different, this is different than this, and depending upon how you define these guys, you

19
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,580
is prime s that's going to give rise to this effect.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,930
So what you need to know is that the person?

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,050
Who is moving?

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,560
Well, always has a time that's lower than the observer seeing that moving.

23
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,410
So in other words, this time is always going to move slower.

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,310
His clocks are going to move slower.

25
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:02,740
Then fill ups and Erick's the Persian stationery on Earth, as you can tell, that's sort of confusing

26
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,240
when you go through these kinds of problems.

27
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,900
You don't have to figure out keep track of what's going on, what is s.

28
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:15,100
What we say is that we're going to designate Terrence this time as a special time, a special time.

29
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,000
We're going to call it what is known as proper time.

30
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:19,720
OK.

31
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,640
And we're going to give it a designation which you'll see in the lot of text books as a not t not.

32
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,000
OK, so I'm going to write this as such Senate and explain what I'm talking about a bit more.

33
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,190
T not c not.

34
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,330
OK.

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,830
So this.

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
Is proper.

37
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,530
Time very important.

38
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,950
Proper time again.

39
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,210
That is the time in the reference frame that is moving or what is more important is the time as measured

40
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,170
by somebody where the two events occur in the same place.

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,960
Now the reason why we call it proper time is because.

42
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,250
For somebody on Earth from an everyday kind of situation when you measure something, you know, if

43
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:17,090
you're in a car and you make your trip when you start the trip and when you end the trip, it occurs

44
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,660
in the same place relative to your reference frame.

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,260
Right?

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,190
You're in the car when it starts and you're in the car when it ends.

47
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,320
That's how we time things.

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:27,950
OK.

49
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,330
That's how you time things.

50
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,440
So it's proper in the sense that it gels up with our intuition, what we're used to viewing times.

51
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:44,840
So again, proper time is always selected as the time where the two events occur on the same place where

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
they're synonymous.

53
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,420
OK.

54
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:54,080
And what is going to happen is that time as measured by somebody who is not moving, who is stationary,

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:54,950
right?

56
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,430
They're going to measure the two events.

57
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,530
Their time is going to be dilated.

58
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,720
It's going to be larger, which is documented in this equation here.

59
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,160
OK, so that in here it asymmetry is built into the problem.

60
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,490
And now you're thinking, Yes, I'm a master of special relativity, so I'm going to throw in something

61
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,720
to mix it up a bit and really make you think about this.

62
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,620
So I just talked about an asymmetry.

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,310
But what I'm going to say, and it's going to sound sort of contradicted.

64
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,820
So a lot of things will sound in special relativity.

65
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,380
There is actually a symmetry at play in this problem.

66
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,640
What what am I talking about here?

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,600
All right.

68
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,110
So I told you there's an asymmetry in the sense that the two events occur at the same place in here

69
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,480
and they don't end this reference frame.

70
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,470
But.

71
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,220
You know, in this set up, Terrance says.

72
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,100
Or rather, Phillips says that your clock is running slow.

73
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,240
That's just how it is.

74
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,620
That's how it's going to be.

75
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:05,280
But at the same time, we could have done this experiment in the reverse direction, which arises some

76
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,770
symmetric property of the experiment, right?

77
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:15,330
Parents could say, Hey, screw this clock, you guys, you have the clock on Earth.

78
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,360
When I fly by on, I'm going to, you know what?

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,380
I'm going, I'm going to measure it.

80
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,470
I'm going to see what happens.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,960
So in that situation, if you have the clock on Earth, this is sort of reversed.

82
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,150
What's going to happen is they're going to measure.

83
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,740
The light coming up and their picture, follow ups and Eric Fisher is going to look something like this,

84
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,590
it's like, what will it observe on Earth?

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,070
We shoot a laser up, it comes back down and we don't have any sensibility about anything moving.

86
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:53,780
But according to parents and the first postulate, special relativity, we cannot determine that he

87
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,370
is moving and they're not or that they're moving and he is not.

88
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:06,070
The first process that's for all to the says that there is no absolute reference frame.

89
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,620
At rest.

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,410
So because of that and because we're an inertial reference frame, Terence is going to say, Hey, I'm

91
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,340
just standing here.

92
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,800
You guys are moving from his reference frame, looking out the window.

93
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,150
It's going to look as though Philip and Eric are moving away from him.

94
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:25,930
All right.

95
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,850
He doesn't know that a ship is moving.

96
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,920
He has no a priori knowledge.

97
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,050
So it may look like these guys are the ones who are removing him from his standpoint.

98
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,970
What Terence is actually going to see, it's going to look like this same picture.

99
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,720
But on Earth?

100
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,840
OK, so these guys are moving.

101
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:54,160
And then what he will say is, according to Esperon, we get something like this the opposite of that.

102
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,470
But if we account for proper time, the proper time.

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,380
Is going to be the people on Earth where it goes up and down.

104
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:13,590
And then Eric is just going to say, gets it gets diluted, dilated.

105
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,460
So we see here that there's an inherent contradiction, right?

106
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:28,090
According to Tarrant's, these guys are moving, but au pair according to fill up.

107
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,010
These guys are moving.

108
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,210
Who's right?

109
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:31,720
Right?

110
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,900
In this case and the original case?

111
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,020
When Terence is moving.

112
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:45,590
Philip is going to say your clock is running slow and the right.

113
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,820
But in the reverse case, we just discussed.

114
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,900
When these guys are moving, cash is going to say, wait a second.

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,280
Fill up.

116
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,140
Your clock is running slow.

117
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,450
And he's right.

118
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,870
Wait a second.

119
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
Doesn't that contradict what's going on here?

120
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,030
No, it doesn't.

121
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,790
It works out.

122
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,300
They're both right.

123
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,840
This is special relativity.

124
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:27,360
What you observe is relative your perspective and the phenomena that arises is relative to your experience,

125
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,770
to your reference frame.

126
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,400
OK, and that's what makes special relativity so weird.

127
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,040
You should be like one the world's going on here, and we're going to take a look in the next video

128
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,820
at something called the twin paradox, which resolves this for you and makes you feel much better.

129
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,560
But they're both right.

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,190
Phillip thinks his clock is running slow, but at the same time, Tarrant's thinks Philip's clock is

131
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:56,320
running slow and they're both right.

132
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,890
That's where relativity folks weird stuff.

133
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,220
All right, I'll resolve that in the next video.

134
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,600
I can let you think about it.

135
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,660
See if you can figure it out.

136
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,740
See if you figure it out.
