1
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,970
All right, in the last few videos in this series, we got a brief taste of the general environment,

2
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,880
an atmosphere that was in place when Ice-T made his breakthrough discovery a special relativity back

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,530
in 19 05.

4
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,760
What did we learn?

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,050
We learned that back in that time, we had really fleshed out the ideas of classical physics Newtonian

6
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,980
mechanics, but rendue mechanics, Hamiltonian mechanics, you name it.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,190
And we were very confident but complacent.

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:52,250
And what we had discovered, right in terms of relativity, it was a very simple, straightforward idea

9
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,950
that we had worked out many, many years ago.

10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,330
What we derived in the first video is the Galilean transformation, a transformation that allows us

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,590
to establish an absolute universal conception between two different perspectives or two different reference

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,160
frames, right?

13
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:17,540
We are trying to make this absolute conception so that if reference frames a observe something and reference

14
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:25,790
frame, b observe the same behavior, we can make their interpretations gel up and make sense right

15
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,070
to be compatible with one another, right?

16
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,050
We wanted this universal conception.

17
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:33,620
OK, so the Galilean transformation allowed us to do that.

18
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,970
But what we found when we started doing the Mikkelson morally experiment.

19
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,800
And when Terrance and Phillip did their experiment with the lasers when they shot out the lasers and

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,930
found that, whoa, this does not extend to electricity magnetism.

21
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:56,000
What we found is that the Galilean transformation is a limited snapshot of a bigger picture, right?

22
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:03,740
We had only understood how the how the universe behaves for a small subset of events rate events that

23
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:12,650
occur with very low velocities, very low speeds, very low situations that do not encompass everything

24
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,140
that could happen in the universe, OK?

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:24,140
So the problem that scientists were really experiencing was the fact that Maxwell, in electricity magnetism,

26
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,140
said light should be constant, but they did not want to believe in that because they're well-established

27
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,450
ideas and notions.

28
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,140
You know, the ideas of classical physics and the Galilean transformation insinuate that if you have

29
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,500
some reference for that's moving really fast, you shoot out some light.

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,610
Guess what?

31
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,990
The light observed by somebody stationary should be faster.

32
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:50,960
We fleshed out those ideas in the last video.

33
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,040
OK, now what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at why chants of fill up when they're

34
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,700
doing their experiment, why they ran into problems, why the Mikkelson morally experiment, why it

35
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,030
changes the face of physics, why it gave us the first breakthrough that had not happened for many,

36
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:11,750
many years, right?

37
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,850
Physics was sort of stagnant at that time.

38
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:21,890
OK, so believe it or not, what Einstein proposed and what Taz and Philip had just discovered in their

39
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,510
experiments is actually the backbone of special relativity.

40
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:25,840
OK?

41
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:34,400
And by accepting this discovery, that light is always constant and asserting this fact, relativistic

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,710
effects are the consequences that arise by accepting these realities, OK?

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,770
So what they had just discovered are the two postulates a special relativity, which I have written

44
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,530
out and documented here and again.

45
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,500
By accepting these possibilities for special relativity, several consequences arise which give birth

46
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:00,050
to special relativity and relativistic effects that we're going to start to discuss in this video,

47
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,230
right?

48
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,670
So this is a super exciting video.

49
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,090
This is going to be your first taste of special relativity.

50
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:11,810
Some of the wacky effects that are introduced as a result of it, and hopefully your mind is blown.

51
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,200
Hopefully, you have a lot of questions.

52
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:21,320
You should write Physics should be a discipline in which you question really, you observe you do not

53
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,860
prescribe.

54
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,720
If you learned that last week, you observe is their and then you critique.

55
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,780
OK, so first, let's go over the postulates that were just discovered in terrorism Phillips' experiment

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,030
or from the Mikkelson immorally experiment that Einstein extracted when he was developing his theory

57
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,140
is the first postulate.

58
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,270
Now I'm going to give the exact wording from a textbook.

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,290
It's going to be a little cryptic and I'm going to explain it.

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,380
Postulate number one states that if I reference Frame X is an inertial frame, remember we went over

61
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:51,890
inertial.

62
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,120
That's a frame which does not have inertial effects, no acceleration.

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,620
It's moving at a cost velocity.

64
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:05,710
So again, this is if a reference frame s is an inertial frame and if a second frame f prime moves of

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,170
a constant velocity keyword here costs velocity for special relativity relative to the original frame

66
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,230
s then s prime is also inertial.

67
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,590
What in the world does that mean you've got?

68
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:18,960
Re-align, you're like, Woo.

69
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,400
I had no idea what that's talking about, but if you dive a bit deeper into it, what's really exciting

70
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,770
is that the laws of physics are invariant between frames now and our second video, we went through

71
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:36,690
this experiment with terrorism and fill up, and I showed that gallium invariance is is a thing.

72
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,300
What was that?

73
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,620
Let's refresh your memory.

74
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,010
Gasoline and variant states that the laws of Newtonian mechanics are going to gel up between reference

75
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,400
frames.

76
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,320
And we proved Newton's second law.

77
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,980
But what this is says, is all the laws of physics are going to be constant or they're going to be arriving

78
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,360
in the same manner, regardless of your reference frame.

79
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,830
OK.

80
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:01,390
So this is a pretty cool possibility and has a lot of consequences associated with it.

81
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,180
One thing which I want you to think about and keep in the back of your head is that if you accept postulate

82
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:14,620
number one with the laws of physics are invalid between frames, it means that there is no absolute

83
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,490
reference frame you like.

84
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,940
Oh, wait a second, we're trying to find this absolute universal conception of physics.

85
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,810
What does that mean?

86
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,610
That basically means that if you have two reference frames, one which you think is stationary and another

87
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,280
one that is moving, there is absolutely no way to figure out what is the moving reference frame and

88
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,630
what is not.

89
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,280
I'm going to repeat that again.

90
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:42,310
There is no way to figure out what reference frame is moving and what is not, because this conception

91
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:47,470
of reality, the conception of a moving reference frame is relative to an observer, right?

92
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,390
There is no absolute conception.

93
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:57,730
So let's say we have fill up you standing on the earth and we see Terence Zoom by in a spaceship.

94
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,380
Philip is going to say Terence is moving, but from Terence's perspective, if he's on a ship and he

95
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:14,070
doesn't know a priori that it's moving, it may look as though the Earth is moving away from him.

96
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,280
Because if there's no acceleration, it may feel as if you're stationary on the ship and you will not

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,910
know that you're moving unless you had studied the stuff previously.

98
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,210
OK?

99
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,530
So I want you to keep that in the back of your head that there's this sort of symmetry, this sort of

100
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,830
duality perspective going on here that you cannot know absolutely who is moving right.

101
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,350
There is no absolute conception of the universe.

102
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,050
Rather, it's relative to reference frames.

103
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,410
OK?

104
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,440
OK.

105
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:49,650
So that's one big postulate that came out of the the observations that Einstein was making and also

106
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,150
from Tyson Phillips' experiment.

107
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:59,160
But the big one, which has passed probably the most significant consequences is postulate number two,

108
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:06,210
and this states that the speed of light in vacuum has the same that you see in every direction, in

109
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,650
all inertial frames.

110
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,300
What does that mean?

111
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,700
Well, this is basically the result we got from the last video where, you know, we had a chance to

112
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:22,830
fill up conducting that experiment with the spaceship through flying away from some stationary, relatively

113
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,270
stationary individual.

114
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:25,980
He shot a laser.

115
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,420
And they both observed the same speed of that light.

116
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:37,050
OK, so this is actually something we've tested again and again and again, which was shown to be true,

117
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:46,200
which is shown to be the way in which the universe really, I guess, takes the phenomenon of light

118
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,680
and transpires in front of us, OK?

119
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,480
So that's how the universe behaves.
