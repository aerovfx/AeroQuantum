00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.480
What I want to do to wrap this video up.

2
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.860
Let's talk about how we proved all this stuff, right?

3
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.280
We just discovered some really wacky stuff.

4
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.860
We discovered that if you move close to the speed of like this, the rest factor is going to die like

5
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.980
time so that the proper time, as observed by the individual who is synonymous with the two events,

6
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.180
right?

7
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.180
His time is going to be long.

8
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.110
His time is going to be acting in a way that doesn't move as fast as the individual who is observing

9
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.410
that when he's not moving, OK.

10
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.990
In other words, their time is going to be larger than the individual.

11
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.310
Who is moving?

12
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.060
All right.

13
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.640
And this sounds weird.

14
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.680
So whenever you discover something new in physics, you want to experimentally verify it.

15
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.500
Now, at the time of the discovery in 1995, that was a monumental task.

16
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.890
You cannot do that very easily, right?

17
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.720
It was very difficult to take a clock and travel close to the speed of light and then compare the two

18
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.230
differences.

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.920
How do you do that?

20
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.830
And in fact, we were not able to verify this and everybody was like, Whoa, that's crazy nonsense.

21
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.440
Until 1941.

22
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.850
So in 1941, two individuals named Rossi and Hall.

23
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.430
They were able to exploit the natural clocks of unstable subatomic particles.

24
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.530
OK, so subatomic particles, you know, muons, so on and so forth.

25
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:56.050
Uh, they tend to decay after a set amount of time and we have this quantity known as Half-Life.

26
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.530
The time out, which half of the number of particles that are present decay, disappear or vanish,

27
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.280
whatever you want.

28
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.210
And if you take these guys, you can use that as a very accurate clock.

29
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.220
It's a very accurate, repeatable measurement.

30
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.170
OK, so what Rossy and Hall found, they said, Hey.

31
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.980
We got these muons, they're created in Earth's upper atmosphere.

32
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.790
These muon particles they created when cosmic rays or energy come down from outer space collide with

33
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.280
our atmospheric particles and.

34
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.250
You know, they come down close to the speed of light and they create these particles.

35
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.130
So if we're moving close to the speed of light, if we measure the decay rate when they're at rest and

36
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.430
compare it to those that are moving in, we should be able to pick up the time dilation effects.

37
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.060
OK.

38
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.830
So we found that, you know, by measuring at rest the half life, which I'm going to write as follows

39
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.920
the half life and I have a lot of board space, but we'll make do the Half-Life at rest.

40
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.770
Let me get my notes here is.

41
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.330
1.5 microseconds, very short.

42
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.170
Now, if we take the muons that are flying in, we're able to separate the different speeds and measure

43
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.190
the decay rate.

44
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:32.680
We should find that if we take this oh, the moving particle, the clock on the particle is moving.

45
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.360
That's the moving reference frame.

46
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.400
And it's also the reference frame for proper time because the birth of a subatomic particle and the

47
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.130
decay of subatomic particle in the reference frame that's moving happens at the same spot.

48
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.480
So according to us, we are this guy.

49
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.840
We are not the proper time.

50
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.730
So t one half.

51
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.380
We'll call that not.

52
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.550
It's going to equal this the gamma factor times Delta T.

53
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.610
One half the proper time.

54
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.160
OK, so if this moves at point eight, 66, the speed of light, we get a factor of two.

55
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.140
We could do a very quick calculation.

56
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.770
It should be two times one point five microseconds.

57
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.970
You should measure something like three microseconds.

58
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.870
OK.

59
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.240
Well, guess what, it is that measurement and they found within experimental error, this was indeed

60
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.770
true.

61
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.040
I don't know what speeds they actually use, but I just use this as an example.

62
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.870
So that was the first time we verified this weird, insane, crazy concept.

63
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.710
All right.

64
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.370
It's true.

65
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.360
It's true.

66
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.120
Our conception of the time was literally different.

67
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.670
Our clocks float at a different rate.

68
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.330
OK?

69
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.440
We observed that the muon clock floats lower, right?

70
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.820
So what other kinds of experiments were done to to verify that we've done a lot?

71
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.370
We've done a lot.

72
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.970
The next one was done in 1971.

73
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.730
We verify time dilation by taking very fast jet planes in the United States Navy Observatory in Washington,

74
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.650
D.C., we used atomic clocks.

75
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.340
Which are very accurate, very precise.

76
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:31.110
And we flew a jet through all the way around the world, came back to the Naval Observatory and measured

77
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.710
the times.

78
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.490
And what we found was that.

79
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.700
The time difference between two.

80
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.890
Was 273.

81
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.440
Plus or minus seven nanoseconds?

82
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.150
And compared to the theory predicted here by Einstein, time dilation.

83
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:09.130
That predicted a time of two hundred and seventy five plus or minus 21 nanoseconds.

84
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.470
This is within the tolerance of this guy confirmed again.

85
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:27.210
Now, what if I told you that basically every day you pop in a car, you do an experiment like this

86
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.640
to verify time dilation because in fact you are, what am I talking about GPS?

87
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.510
Do you use GPS?

88
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.730
We used to have those TomTom's those big, bulky devices.

89
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.560
Now we use our smartphones.

90
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.040
But what I want to tell you is that.

91
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.720
Yes, indeed.

92
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:57.050
Your GPS Global Positioning System uses satellites and communicates from space down to Earth.

93
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.840
We need precise measurements.

94
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.290
So.

95
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:08.760
You know, that movie reference frame when it's tracking our position, if we do not account for relativistic

96
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.890
effects, we will be off.

97
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:17.210
My prediction of where something on the Earth, our global position will be off significantly in order

98
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.800
to get good results.

99
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.080
You must account for time dilation.

100
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.640
So every time you hop in your car and you go take a trip, use GPS.

101
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.770
You are verifying time relation.

102
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.650
You're doing an experiment that verify this.

103
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.810
This is a true fact.

104
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:33.940
This is reality.

105
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.910
So yes, time dilation is weird.

106
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.060
But it's true.

107
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.130
It's something that happens every day, it's something that you verify every single day and use.

108
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.150
Practically every single day.

109
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.860
So what do we find we found that.

110
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:59.500
Time dilation arises as a result of accepting the second postulate, a special relativity that it does

111
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.600
not matter what reference frame you measure light regardless of your reference frame.

112
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:10.300
As long as there's inertial reference frame, that's speed of light will be constant, it's going to

113
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.690
be see regardless of how how you measure it.

114
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.150
It's always going to be key.

115
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.480
So as a consequence of this fact, when you account for that, do some experiments.

116
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.030
What we find is that time dilates, OK.

117
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:32.620
The implied effect from it is known as time dilation, or that a moving clock is observed to move slow.

118
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.900
OK, so using this, we developed this relation here.

119
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.010
Delta T.

120
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:46.330
The time where the events are not synonymous is equal to this Lorenz factor times the proper time where

121
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.920
the events are synonymous.

122
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.390
And it gets dilated.

123
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.200
All right.

124
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.610
We get some weird effects.

125
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.610
We're going to observe rather study this a bit more by taking a look at the twin paradox.

126
00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.120
Take a look at that symmetry.

127
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:05.350
I outline that weird event that both individuals think that the opposite thing is true and are both

128
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:07.030
right and the next video.

129
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.320
Hope you like it!

130
00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:09.520
Stay tuned.
