00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.420
Now that a ripple effect in the body of physics has indeed been identified.

2
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.610
Let's take a closer look at those ripples and try to better understand what kind of theoretical implications

3
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.500
they actually have now.

4
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.930
In our last video, we found that momentum, for the most part, seemed to follow the conventions we

5
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.490
have from classical physics, namely that it is conserved between two states.

6
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.840
However, what we found is that weird, odd relativistic effects tend to crop up close to high speeds

7
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.220
close to the speed of light.

8
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.250
In particular, what we found is that as we approach the speed of light, the inertial inertia of an

9
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.040
object or body, or any kind of system tends to increase in a sense that it tends to resist any kind

10
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.000
of force that tries to accelerate to a higher velocity.

11
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.010
So the net effect is that if you're trying to accelerate an object closer to the speed of light, it

12
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.930
gets harder and harder and harder as we approach that cap.

13
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.270
OK, now if we think about this from an energy standpoint, it becomes very interesting, right?

14
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.650
Logically, we can assert that if it's harder and harder to apply, force and accelerate to a higher

15
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.610
velocity, that seems to insinuate that as we get closer and closer to the speed of light, we would

16
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.990
need more and more and more energy to get an additional velocity into that particle into that system

17
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.310
that we're analyzing.

18
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.930
So naturally, we could assume that just like momentum, perhaps some kind of relativistic effect could

19
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.900
come into play, crop up in reality and start to appear close to the speed of light.

20
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.720
So what we're going to do in this video is we're going to follow along what we did with classical mechanics,

21
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.880
back with Newtonian mechanics.

22
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.300
What do we do after we derived expressions for momentum?

23
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.260
What we did is we use that to derive expressions for force.

24
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.070
And then that was used to do to derive notions and concepts of energy and in particular, what we hope

25
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.060
would hold in special relativity conservation of energy.

26
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.630
Right.

27
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.280
We're going to investigate energy.

28
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.230
We're going to see if our intuition, which feels like there's some kind of weird effect that would

29
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.800
crop up close to the speed of light, whether that's true or not.

30
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.390
And the way in which we're going to do this again, we're going to follow the same conventions now back

31
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.510
in classical physics and Newtonian mechanics.

32
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.000
What we did is we made use of something known as the work energy principle, which in essence states

33
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.040
that any force you apply to an object that's going to result in a change of kinetic energy.

34
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.360
In other words, if you push an object that's going to create kinetic energy, you're putting energy

35
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.350
into the system, and that energy allows us to move at a higher velocity, right?

36
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.630
Recall the work energy principle, right?

37
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.640
In words where I just explain this theory that any work W done by all forces acting on a particle is

38
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.330
equivalent to the change in the particles kinetic energy.

39
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.700
OK?

40
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.600
So if we use this, this really provides us with the recipe and ingredients that are required for baking

41
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.840
a new relativistic energy equation.

42
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.620
And that's what we're going to tackle right now.

43
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:28.900
So the first thing we want to do.

44
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.540
We got the ingredients.

45
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.760
We got this new relativistic momentum.

46
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.990
We have a recipe, a structure that we use in classical physics.

47
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.490
Let's take those ingredients and start throwing them into our recipe and see what is ulit from cooking

48
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.390
up this new formula.

49
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.950
So the first thing we find is that as we do in classical physics, our force is equal to the derivative

50
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:53.640
of the momentum.

51
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.310
OK?

52
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.630
That's what we use to figure out the force.

53
00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.920
Right.

54
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.390
It forces a change in momentum.

55
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.910
It's a change in the motion of a particle.

56
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.160
We're going to apply the same ideas here to see what happens using our new special relativity ideas.

57
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.950
So what we could do is we could take what we derived in the previous video from an atom, which is momentum

58
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.390
is equal to this gamma.

59
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.010
In terms of the velocity of the object, the particle, the system are analyzing times, the rest mass

60
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.470
of that object, Typekit velocity of it.

61
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.630
So if we take this and recall, that became a factor which is responsible for, I guess, introducing

62
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.210
all these relativistic effects and to find out such we can take this and throw it straight through the

63
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.170
work energy principle.

64
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.840
So as I said, any kind of work done on the system is due to the force trying to move it.

65
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.350
It's the force over the distance that object moves.

66
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.490
F. Scott, D. Yes, this is the distance of what you mutes.

67
00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.120
So that work that you put into the system allows to speed up and that results in a change in its kinetic

68
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.470
energy.

69
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.510
OK, so we're going to use this as the recipe.

70
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.270
We got the ingredients we started putting those ingredients in.

71
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.910
Let's charge forward in this recipe and cooking up this nice new formula, OK?

72
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.930
So using this guy, what we could do is say the change of kinetic energy is just.

73
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.030
This we take f we plug that guy in here, we have the same exact result.

74
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.840
The derivative of gamma, every with respect to time right there and that is dot it into this.

75
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.280
Yes.

76
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.280
Now if we're assuming a constant velocity, no kind of change, no external force being applied aside

77
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:46.480
from this guy here, what we know is that a change in distance, it's just the right fit one 180.

78
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.320
We plug that guy in and we end up with this weird formula here.

79
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.070
And what we're going to do is we're going to assume that initially this object was at rest.

80
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.190
We're trying to put energy into the system.

81
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.330
So it goes from rest to some velocity, right?

82
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.030
So after a time, t, it has velocity.

83
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.540
So we're going to integrate from zero to T from state one to state two.

84
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.960
OK.

85
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.630
So using this, how do we make progress?

86
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.370
How can we make additional progress?

87
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.460
What we can do is we can make a note of what we had previously in the last video on momentum that mass,

88
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.240
we're going to use an invariant mass.

89
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.350
It's not a to change.

90
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.070
We're not going to assume there's a variable mass because that introduces a lot of problems.

91
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.750
We're not even going to go into that.

92
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.090
We're going to see in that there's a rest mass, right?

93
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.650
The mass we measure when an object at rest and that is constant.

94
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:41.830
So what we could do is we could pull this mass out of the derivative, out of the integral and it becomes

95
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.340
as such.

96
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.850
The other thing we're going to make use of is the dot product, right, the DOT product.

97
00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.500
We have this vector here in that vector right there.

98
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:52.570
This is the differential doesn't matter.

99
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.190
It still behaves in the same fashion.

100
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.290
So we have V2V and the angle between those vectors is zero.

101
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.270
What's going to happen is you just get the magnitude of the time, the magnitude of V and, you know,

102
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.280
cosine of the angle between the cosine 0s one.

103
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.540
So DV dot v.

104
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.010
Well, you know what?

105
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.790
That's just the magnitudes a v and V.

106
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.580
So what we end up with is we're going to pull the mass out and we just get the magnitude of the I'm

107
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.870
going to start dealing with vectors henceforth.

108
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.150
So that's, you know, energy is not a vector.

109
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.830
So that drives well for intuition.

110
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.880
And we get the phone, we get the magnitude of velocity times.

111
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.890
This weird differential of gamma times, the magnitude of velocity and we make a change of the differential.

112
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.670
We have to switch from time to this new differential, Crosby.

113
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.360
So we're going to go from zero to final velocity times Ghana.

114
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.360
Now at this point, you're thinking, Whoa, OK.

115
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.330
So we put all these ingredients into this recipe that didn't really bake a nice relativistic energy

116
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.050
equation for us.

117
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.780
So what we need to do is we need a marinade in a bit.

118
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.430
We need to put some seasoning in there.

119
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.740
So it's more appetizing and it gives us some kind of form that's more appealing to us.

120
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.820
So what we're going to do is we're going to take this guy here, which we have no idea what in the world

121
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:10.840
is to try and communicate.

122
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.690
What we're going to do is we're going to use our favorite tool in all physics, right?

123
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:23.890
One of my professors has asserted that integration by parts which you studied in calc two, most likely

124
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.050
is probably one of the most useful tools in all physics because it allows us to make a lot of progress

125
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.820
in deriving very important results.

126
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.410
So we're going to make use of this here.

127
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:40.210
And if you recall what this data states that if we have an integral of some quantum you'd've that is

128
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:47.860
equal to you tied to be defined from states one or two minus the integral of the EU, another way of

129
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:54.300
thinking about this is literally just taking the derivative of this guy right here you would get you'd've

130
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.550
plus BTU.

131
00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.180
It's just a rearrangement of that idea.

132
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:04.180
So if we take this, we can make headway on this guy and convert it into a form which we could actually

133
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.850
evaluate it using our calc one on one talks.

134
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.780
So what we're going to do is we're going to say this v here.

135
00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.400
It's going to be the U.

136
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:20.700
Down here, as you can see in green and the Delta Gamma V, this guy is going to be the DV as designated

137
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.460
in blue here.

138
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:27.850
So if we take that, we can start getting a very interesting form of equation here.

139
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:36.640
So I'm going to work it out with you just because it involves a lot of math and a lot of textbooks actually,

140
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.050
unfortunately just says, Oh, they say, Oh, it can be shown that do this.

141
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.740
I don't like that.

142
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.730
I want to be your ally in learning this, so we're going to work through it together.

143
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:50.800
So Delta K e when we apply, this guy here are term.

144
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.220
It's going to pop out and we see we have a U.

145
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.470
V right here, defined from one to two.

146
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:57.310
OK.

147
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.900
So we have you here.

148
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.320
V is just going to be what is inside the differential here.

149
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.860
So we get a delta, not a delta.

150
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.130
Again, sorry about that.

151
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.430
We get a gamma b plus another B.

152
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.900
Actually, I'm going to keep the M here just because it's going to look.

153
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.830
It's going to look nice.

154
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:16.570
So we get this guy times.

155
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:17.100
AMA.

156
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:19.640
And B squared.

157
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.450
And you're probably thinking what happened to this?

158
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:27.240
This going from state to state to in essence what we did, we just we literally plugged it in.

159
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:33.870
So you plug in Gamma B and then zero at state one that literally cancels so we don't get any kind of

160
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.230
results.

161
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.880
So it just disappears from that.

162
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.160
And in next what we get, we need to subtract this integral here.

163
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.950
So I'm to bring the M.

164
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:49.140
It comes along for the ride and then we have this integral and then we have the U.

165
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.600
Well, this is just Gamma V..

166
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.580
OK, so that's gamma.

167
00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:00.790
I'm just going to leave it as gamma, so we get gamma the and then deal is Steve.

168
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:09.190
And what we're going to do if we go from zero to, I don't know why I keep saying Delta as a gamma gamma

169
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.490
v.

170
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.600
We're going to f with zero two V.

171
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:15.730
If we change the differential, that's just to be there.

172
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.860
And we see here now we have a form which we could potentially integrate.

173
00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.570
So we made some progress in a range of my parts is awesome and allows you to do that most of the time.

174
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:30.480
So we get this guy here and we know that this is a function of velocity.

175
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.010
So we can't just leave it as a gamma anymore.

176
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:38.110
What we're going to do is we're going to really throw in the exact value right there.

177
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.520
So we get a B.

178
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.990
And again, I'm going to drop all the vector notation because we're just dealing with scholars here.

179
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:51.820
We're going to be divided by the square root of one minus V or C.

180
00:11:53.210 --> 00:12:00.920
Squared and when we see that, we say, Oh, that looks like something I solved and talk one on one

181
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:01.490
before.

182
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.190
I can make headway.

183
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.330
I can work with this, I can solve it.

184
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:13.030
So we're going to do is we're going to solve this guy here by making a simple use of substitution,

185
00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:18.580
which you've probably done in calculus before a lot of individuals who are running through this, they

186
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.460
say, Oh, we're just going to get some kind of integral from a table.

187
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.030
Now we're going to do it, we're going to do the math right.

188
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.110
You learn physics by doing physics.

189
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.270
So we're going to do it, OK?

190
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:35.410
So what we get is we're going to say and maybe you can pick up the use of yourself.

191
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.230
We're going to let G.

192
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.400
So we don't get confused.

193
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.660
I don't like having a you.

194
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.640
It's too close to a V.

195
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:48.580
We're going to say G is going to equal negative v over C quantity squared.

196
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:50.430
OK.

197
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.690
So when we make this substitution, we need to solve this in four days.

198
00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.850
We need to differentiate this first in terms of B, so what we're going to do is we're going to dig

199
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:03.440
deep.

200
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.270
Take the derivative and we end up with.

201
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:10.390
The first derivative, we get this quantity squared.

202
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.840
This is a constant it pops out, so we get negative to be.

203
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:23.490
Over C squared that comes along for the ride and then change, which we would get like a DVD something

204
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.140
else, but we're doing it in terms of fee.

205
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.650
So we're pushing it so we don't have to apply that.

206
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:34.170
So what happens is we get this guy and we want to isolate a fee and a DVD so we can actually integrate

207
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:35.130
this right?

208
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.220
So we're in good shape.

209
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.400
We got confidence here.

210
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.060
We can multiply by negative c squared.

211
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.410
Over two.

212
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.980
Times.

213
00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.620
And that is equal to the DV.

214
00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:56.510
So what I want to do is I want to put your attention to two parameters.

215
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.280
We got this guy.

216
00:13:59.260 --> 00:13:59.860
Right here.

217
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:09.110
And we have the same term right in there, so we can literally plug this in substitute g there and we'll

218
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:13.640
get a form of the integral that we can actually solve.

219
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.000
OK.

220
00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.350
So what happens is.

221
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.450
We get the following we find that this integral.

222
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:35.750
From zero 02 v v over Route one minus v over C quantity squared, DV is no different than an integral.

223
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.320
Of the quantity.

224
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:46.340
One man is VRC squared or one plus G.

225
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.310
That quantity to the negative one half.

226
00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.460
And we got two slots of two in a value for this guy, which we found here.

227
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.680
So this gets multiplied by.

228
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.360
A negative C squared.

229
00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:09.990
Over two.

230
00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:12.690
DG.

231
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.170
And when we see this.

232
00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.450
It's something that you've probably solved many times before.

233
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.050
This is an easy, easy guide to solve.

234
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.130
So let's actually do that, but before we do it, we need to go from TV to the IG.

235
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.390
So if we're going from zero to be, we're going from plus zero in here.

236
00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.880
We're going from zero to negative yursik squared.

237
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:45.420
OK, so we're going to use that guy at the limit of the integration.

238
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:55.690
And let's solve this, well, if we have 1+ due to the baby one half, what you do is you literally

239
00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:01.410
add one to the exponent and you get one plus year.

240
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:08.630
So the one half and then you invert that exponent, so we're going to have to multiply by two.

241
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.930
So count for the funeral.

242
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.390
And then we multiply by this concern right here, it comes along for the ride, this negative C squared

243
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.100
over two.

244
00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.870
And then we would have to evaluate from zero.

245
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:33.970
To the oversea quantities square, and we have a little negative right out front right there.

246
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.960
OK, so what we do is we find these twos cancel.

247
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:49.660
And this just becomes no different than let's plug this guy in David C squared.

248
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.310
And.

249
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:54.900
It's the square root.

250
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.360
One plus the.

251
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:05.410
Over C squared, I made a sign of steak that's actually a negative.

252
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:13.990
And then we subtract when we plug in a zero four g, which would give us literally a C squared, so

253
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.860
we add a C square or wait a minute, let's back up a bit.

254
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.450
So that negative sign, we're subtracting a negative sign that becomes a positive.

255
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.620
So we get that guy.

256
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:29.320
So Rick, anyway, we went through the exercise of evaluating this integral.

257
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.510
We got a result.

258
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.640
I didn't cop out on you guys.

259
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.660
I solved it with you.

260
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.440
I held your hand.

261
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:36.610
We're good to go.

262
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.870
So what we could do is we plug this guy straight into that integral there.

263
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.590
And what we end up with is gamma.

264
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.860
M the squared.

265
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.870
Minus M times the quantity.

266
00:17:54.670 --> 00:18:04.720
Negative C squared routes, one minus the over C squared plus C squared.

267
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.430
And close off that bracket, so we're making headway, we're making headway.

268
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:15.550
What we find is we get this weird expression, and at first it sort of seems like what in the world

269
00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:16.540
happened to our energy?

270
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.490
This is sort of foreign to us.

271
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.450
Let's make headway.

272
00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.130
Let's keep working on this recipe.

273
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.630
Let's keep baking the equation.

274
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:37.300
So this is equal to gamma M.V. squared plus and c squared is square root one minus B or C quantity squared.

275
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.950
Minus and c squared.

276
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.890
So you see us and see square popping up, and that might make you think of that famous equation that

277
00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:49.450
Einstein came up with, which is good.

278
00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.500
So seems like we're converging upon what Einstein did.

279
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.270
Let's see what we can do.

280
00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.500
What we want to do is what a group terms.

281
00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.810
But it's not in a form that looks very appealing.

282
00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.930
OK, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to plug this guy in.

283
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:06.550
Basically, this.

284
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:16.130
Divide by the square root of one minus v be overseen, and I'm gonna try and make these guys have a

285
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:20.030
common denominator such that we can apply the numerator.

286
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.660
OK?

287
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.900
And as you probably would guess, you probably would guess a gamma is also going to pop out, as has

288
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.700
happened with previous results.

289
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.830
So what we do is we want to get this guy having the same form.

290
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:45.200
What we could do is we can get this and we can say this times one, we're multiply by one this same

291
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.680
term.

292
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:56.840
Such and I had a negative M.S. squared with a very ugly end there.

293
00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:58.310
What we do is.

294
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:06.190
We see that this becomes literally I'll write it, I'll spell it out for you guys, so this just becomes

295
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.460
m v squared.

296
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:12.750
Plus.

297
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:22.930
And C squared times this times that one half plus one half gives you a one in the exponent one minus

298
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:26.650
B or C quantity squared.

299
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:36.430
Divided by this guy, so we got our gamma factor out in front, that's looking good.

300
00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.580
And then the NSC squared comes along for the ride.

301
00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:47.350
So what we can see is that we get an empty square here minus and c squared about a square o minus empty

302
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.730
square.

303
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.770
Oh, look at that bam.

304
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.730
And then this term cancels out with that.

305
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:54.700
So what are we left with?

306
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.130
So if we erased this guy here?

307
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.050
And we finish.

308
00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:15.480
If belabored exercise, what we get is that the change in kinetic energy is equal to again, this guy

309
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.260
and b squared.

310
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:22.660
Minus C squared cancels here we get minus envy squared plus C squared.

311
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:31.990
So we get in and C squared over the square root of one minus B or C, that's our beautiful gamma factor.

312
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.880
So we see relativistic effects cropping up minus M.C. squared.

313
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:45.190
Ooh, that's looking a bit nicer than previously, and we can make this super fly by pulling out the

314
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.870
C squared, noting that this is a gamma, so I'll work through it for you.

315
00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:57.550
So we don't get confused is again as c squared minus M.C. squared, which is no different than gamma

316
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.380
minus one.

317
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.000
M c squared.

318
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.360
Oh, that looks interesting, so.

319
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:14.640
We look at this result here, and we find that our intuition was indeed correct.

320
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:20.670
It's the inertia or the resistance to speeding up increases as we approach the speed of light.

321
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.760
Then our intuition that that would require more and more energy, greater amounts of energy for every

322
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:32.550
single unit of velocity that is gained closer to the speed of light that would require more energy.

323
00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.360
And we see here that that possibly may be cropping up.

324
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.140
Right.

325
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:43.800
So what we're going to do next is we're going to try to reduce this guy here down to the classical result

326
00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:51.030
and see if that can give us any kind of information regarding the kinetic energy regarding relativistic
