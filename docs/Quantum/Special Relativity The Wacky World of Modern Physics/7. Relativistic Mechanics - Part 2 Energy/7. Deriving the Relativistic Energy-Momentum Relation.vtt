00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.750
All right.

2
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.900
So far in our study of relativistic mechanics, we've identified several ripple effects that were introduced

3
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.720
into the body of physics as a result of completely redefining and reshaping our conception of space

4
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.740
and time.

5
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.450
What exactly did we discover?

6
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.450
We found that as a result of introducing these new concepts regarding space and time, we had to completely

7
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.950
redefine our conception of momentum and energy and in redefining them, they had a lot of several intriguing

8
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.470
implications that came along for the ride.

9
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.820
However, we did not really look into or ask one very essential question, which is particularly important

10
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.260
for this course.

11
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.160
And that is the following if we make a measurement of momentum or energy in one inertial frame, is

12
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.070
it also true in another inertial frame?

13
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.030
In other words, is our measurement of both of these quantities absolute.

14
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.540
OK.

15
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.740
And this is particularly important in this course because we spent so much time and energy trying to

16
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.890
bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions or perspectives of the universe, right?

17
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.570
Ultimately, our goal was to come up with this nice universal conception of the universe that was absolute

18
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.030
such that individuals and different reference frames could discuss their experiences and they could

19
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.930
be aligned.

20
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:48.300
OK, now, as you can imagine, when you measure momentum and energy and as we have discovered in previous

21
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.840
lectures, if you have, you know, like the ideas of loss, the addition and it changes between reference

22
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.000
frames, it's pretty straightforward.

23
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.100
See that if you measure momentum and one reference frame, it's going to be different in another reference

24
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.330
frame, which completely destroys that nice bridge we put together for space time.

25
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.320
So what we're going to do in this video is we're going to try and correct that issue by reconstructing

26
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.950
that bridge.

27
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Refining it and making sure it allows us to measure momentum and energy.

28
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.790
You one reference frame and related to that same measurement and another reference frame.

29
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.270
In other words, we'll try to make these quantities absolute.

30
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.300
OK.

31
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.880
In order to do that, let's review what we've discovered with momentum and energy.

32
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.510
And then we're going to start constructing that bridge now, as we found previously with momentum and

33
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.020
energy.

34
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.900
They have to be modified by this Lorentz factor, which is a function of the velocity of any kind of

35
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.170
particle we're analyzing.

36
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.880
OK, so we need to find momentum by redefining it.

37
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.140
We said that we have a scanner tied to the original definition and not be.

38
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.100
And in essence, what happens is as we get closer to the speed of light, relativistic effects crop

39
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.180
up and inertia builds up, so it's harder to further accelerate.

40
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.570
Similarly, we found that for relativistic energy, we had this growth factor times the rest mass and

41
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.130
not Times Square.

42
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.020
OK, now the first thing I want to talk about is, you know, when we try to relate these guys and try

43
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.900
to come up with this idea, that's absolute.

44
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.490
We may come up with a formula or relationship that allows us to convert between the two, and that would

45
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.270
be convenient.

46
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.680
And in fact, that's what we have done in classical mechanics.

47
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.280
Let's let's review what happened.

48
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.470
So we know these relativistic quantities, but in classical mechanics, we said that, you know, if

49
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.710
you have energy and your total energy is composed of, let's say, kinetic energy based upon how you

50
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.300
define your reference for potential energy, we can say the kinetic energy, which is equal to one half

51
00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.420
and be squared, is equal to the momentum squared over two m and I.

52
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.580
You use useful relation where if we knew momentum, we could quickly convert it into kinetic energy.

53
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.900
OK.

54
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.960
So when we're trying to get this translational tool similar to the Lawrence transformation for space

55
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.250
time, but for momentum and energy, it would be nice if we could relate these to at the same time.

56
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.150
OK, now the first relationship we're going to put together is not the ultimate one that bridges the

57
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.720
gap, but it's going to help to motivate us and elicit some different terms that we're going to find

58
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.560
in that relationship.

59
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.750
The first thing we're going to do is when we look at these definitions here, we see that they have

60
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.130
common factors, the Lorenz factor down here, this square root term here.

61
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.940
And if we divide them, we could cancel out a lot of terms.

62
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.180
And you end up with a pretty interesting quantity.

63
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.000
For example, we could get rid of these square roots.

64
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.320
We could get rid of the A. And we'll be left with the velocity and the speed of light.

65
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.470
So let's do that and see what happens.

66
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.650
So if we divide Equation one by Equation two as follows, we get p over e.

67
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.200
These guys cancel and not cancel.

68
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.410
So they're not the square roots 'cause of the square root, as I just mentioned.

69
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.380
And we end up with V Overseas Squared.

70
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.550
Now to make this simpler and to use a term that we've seen.

71
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.960
Use the R relativistic velocity Bayda v oversea.

72
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:30.950
We can multiply both sides by C drop off that square root term, and what we end up with is PC over

73
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.470
E equals B or C or better.

74
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:39.320
Now that's an important conclusion, which has a lot of analytical implications when we're running through

75
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:47.330
problems because if we know better, that's going to tell us that it kills a relation or a feel for

76
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.020
both the relativistic energy and momentum, right?

77
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:57.800
Furthermore, if we know, if we ever see which is a dimensionless quantity, in other words, it's

78
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.590
a blast of your velocity, which has no dimensions.

79
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.720
That means that whatever's on the top here has to have the same dimensions as the bottom.

80
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.620
So this tells us that we cover light energy and momentum initially by this PC term here.

81
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:19.670
Basically, says P.S. is nothing more than an expression of energy in and of itself.

82
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.080
So that's pretty interesting.

83
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.770
So we're trying to bridge the gap and come up with this universal quantity and we establish relationships

84
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.310
between EMP.

85
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.940
We expect to have a total energy and a p c term popping out.

86
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.270
This PC term should be related to the kinetic energy because momentum is right.

87
00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.730
We can see right here is related to velocity.

88
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.600
It should be related to the kinetic energy that gives us some initial intuition we have when going into

89
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.640
this huge, monumental task of erecting that bridge for relativistic mechanics.

90
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.600
OK, so let's tackle that that issue next in the way in which we're going to do that, we're going to

91
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.460
a similar exercise.

92
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.080
We're going to try and relate Part E and try to pull these terms up.

93
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.680
We're going to see a PC term is going to pop straight out.

94
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.070
OK.

95
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.830
So the way in which we're going to do that is we're going to take Equation two for the total energy,

96
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.610
the total relativistic energy, and we're going to square both sides.

97
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.670
And then we're going to use a trick worry insert this term v squared minus v squared.

98
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.620
Now what is this quantity?

99
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.920
In essence, this quantity is equal to zero, right?

100
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.460
If you take a term and subtract the same term from itself.

101
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.500
You end up with nothing zero.

102
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.040
So if we add this term onto a quantity, it's basically like adding zero and you don't change that quantity.

103
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.800
That's the analytical approach we're going to take here, OK?

104
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.300
So keep that in the back of your head.

105
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.050
We're going to do that pretty quickly in this exercise.

106
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:59.240
So as I said, squaring equation two, well, we end up with on both sides as each square on the left

107
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.930
and on the right side, we get N-not squared times C to the fourth and then the square root term.

108
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.790
We kick that away.

109
00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:08.750
It vanishes.

110
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:14.140
We get one minus beta squared with a relativistic velocity we ever see squared.

111
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:23.390
OK, now this is where we used the trick of inserting zero because what we're going to do is what I

112
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:28.970
think the C to the fourth, and we're going to split it up into C Square Times Square.

113
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:35.870
So the a c squared times squared and you add zero onto the second term, right?

114
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.370
This b square amount of this squared.

115
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.350
I didn't change anything here.

116
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.480
This is still the same exact term.

117
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.340
We have lost no value and we have not made any analytical implications.

118
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:52.460
But what we have gained is we're going to we're going to massage just a bit and we're going to see that

119
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.110
this term is going to start popping out along with other energy terms.

120
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.660
We've explored so far in this course.

121
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.070
Let's do just that.

122
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.490
OK.

123
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.420
So we have to be square miles v squared and that's what we want to do.

124
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:12.410
But if you want to factor out these terms and see what happens, so let's distribute and not Square

125
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:19.280
Town C squared times the first time we squared bam, it popped out right there in the first term second

126
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:19.670
term.

127
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.150
Same exact thing, but we got a minus term in the front right.

128
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.100
Negative and not square.

129
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.360
C squared times.

130
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.930
B squared.

131
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.050
Bam.

132
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.390
That's the second term.

133
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.440
Now the final term, we think, and that's grand c squared.

134
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.440
And we get back this initial term right here.

135
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:43.190
So we got the smart square C squared or the one minus relativistic velocity of your C squared.

136
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.020
And as you can see, since these guys were equal, they cancel out.

137
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.900
This basically equals zero plus the original term here.

138
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.200
We did not change anything by using this nice fancy trick.

139
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.810
Let's chug along and see what this provides us, what advantage just gives us.

140
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.730
So the first thing I want you to do is I want you to make note on the following.

141
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.250
This guy looks a little similar to equation number one.

142
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:17.840
And we're trying to pull out that momentum turned up, so perhaps we could massage this a bit and we

143
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.960
can arrange it in a form where it sort of looks like this.

144
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.640
We see an m not.

145
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.500
We see a v there.

146
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.700
They're squared.

147
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.710
But what happened to this radical?

148
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.420
We see that every square that.

149
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:38.550
We basically get rid of the rifle so we can see there's sort of a pattern here that is squared if we

150
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.930
factor out that c squared.

151
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.760
So let's do just that.

152
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:47.970
Let's pull the NRA squared v squared over this guy and go straight up here.

153
00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:48.810
OK.

154
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.960
So when we do that, we see that if we take this and square it, we get it, not square v squared over

155
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.270
the quantity one, b or C squared.

156
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.270
Basically, this guy right here, we square that and we pull out c squared as follows.

157
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:10.170
So as you can see, matching these guys up, we are indeed going to get a momentum tear that pops up.

158
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:14.610
This works well, all the intuition we built initially in the beginning of this lecture.

159
00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.770
Let's chuck long.

160
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.930
So the next thing we need to do, we did that for this term.

161
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:25.230
We want to sort of grouped these terms and try to simplify this and pull out a nice energy parameter.

162
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.070
So what we're going to do is we're going to note some common terms.

163
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:36.870
They have the same denominator and we see an enlarge squared c squared here can be square, but this

164
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.630
also has an mark square c square.

165
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.060
So we factor out that and not Square C squared.

166
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:51.600
We end up with the denominator one minus vs the or C squared and that m Oscar C squared times C squared

167
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.940
minus B squared again.

168
00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.140
Let's run through that pouyanne and those squared c squared.

169
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.150
If you multiply that by c squared, we get this term here.

170
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:02.820
And let's square C to the fourth minus.

171
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.740
Well, multiply by b squared.

172
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.010
We get this term that that yields the bottom.

173
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:09.570
So we're making headway.

174
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.530
We're making progress.

175
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.120
Let's see what happens next.

176
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:19.740
What we want to do is we want to hearken back to equation number one, our relativistic momentum, and

177
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.250
we find that this relation is the same as that guy.

178
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.930
We can plug it up.

179
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.510
So it's p square times, c squared.

180
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:28.160
Bam.

181
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.360
We got that, that nice new energy term.

182
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.190
We just arrived right up here.

183
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:32.970
OK.

184
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.110
That's what we want to do is we look at this and we see that if we massage it just a little bit, we

185
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:44.580
can make the top the numerator equal to the denominator and cancel it out.

186
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.460
What we're going to do is for the numerator.

187
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.540
We're going to pull out a C squared and see what happens.

188
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:59.100
So if we pull out a C squared, we have one C squared there, minus if we multiply by B squared over

189
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.500
C squared and I'm going to write that up right here.

190
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:09.000
So it's sort of like c squared times one minus v over C, and I'm going to put squared up here.

191
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.060
You multiply that through, you get that turn.

192
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.210
The C Square cancels that and you get the B squared.

193
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.650
So that's what we're going to do because we see that this would cancel back, guy.

194
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.600
So we pull out the C squared.

195
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.690
This becomes and square C to the fourth.

196
00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:29.490
And then what we're left with is just this guy, right?

197
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.080
Because the C Squared has two, we got one there minus b squared.

198
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:41.760
And what's really cool is you can take this guy, you c numerator because the denominator kick that

199
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.470
guy out, that's equal to one.

200
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.350
And we get a very interesting parameter here.

201
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.820
What does this look like here?

202
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:48.930
What does that look like?

203
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.450
That looks like our rest energy, right?

204
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.690
We got an end, not squared.

205
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.250
A C squared squared.

206
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:59.400
So sort of like A. C. Squared that whole quantity squared, and that's exactly what we do.

207
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.720
So we go to the next step.

208
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.600
We know this is energy from up here.

209
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.530
So we know it's sort of like energy squared, which makes sense because we have energy squared over

210
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:07.950
here.

211
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:13.890
So we get a PC squared and our energy and not c squared right there.

212
00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.510
And ladies and gentlemen, this is the bridge we've been waiting for.

213
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:27.120
This is the bridge that helps to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions of the universe

214
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.320
and perspectives, and it gives us that nice universal conception of the universe that we're looking

215
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:31.530
for.

216
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.790
Because if we take this here, we see these are all energy quantities.

217
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:43.410
But what's interesting is if we move the PC square to the left, we see everything on the left is equal

218
00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:51.540
to and not c squared, which we can say a few things about the rest, energy and off the squared.

219
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:57.060
This is a constant rate that the measurement of mass arrest is not going to change.

220
00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.910
And different reference reigns agree upon that.

221
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.710
And furthermore, different reference frames agree upon a speed of light.

222
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.280
Right.

223
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.560
In all inertial frames.

224
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:15.500
And not and c squared multiply together is an invariant quantity that's an important application.

225
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.930
It's an invariant quantity.

226
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:26.210
So if let's say Philip is looking at some kind of event transpire in his reference frame and he calculates

227
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:32.630
E Squared Mom's P Square based upon measurements in his brain and terrorist does the same exact thing.

228
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.910
This quantity here, it will be the same.

229
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.630
So, yes, Philip may measure one momentum.

230
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.610
Parents may measure another one.

231
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.290
Same with energy.

232
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.860
But when they calculate this quantity here, that will be invariant.

233
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.410
This is an absolute quantity.

234
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.290
It's exactly what we're looking for.

235
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:57.710
OK.

236
00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.990
So it's sort of like a mathematical exercise.

237
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.170
We got two guys up popped out right here.

238
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.760
Relations that are useful.

239
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:11.820
This allows us to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions, but it also relates momentum

240
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:19.720
and energy in both instances, also related to the mass, the rest energy and warming up through problems.

241
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:26.820
This gives us a lot of analytical leverage because if we know the momentum and the mass, we can calculate

242
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.340
the energy pretty quickly and you're going to see that when you run through these problems, and we'll

243
00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.480
do an example next.

244
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:42.580
We can use this to find unknown quantities, and it's going to be extremely, extremely useful.

245
00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:48.010
Next, we're going to take a deeper look at the implications this result has.

246
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:55.450
And then we're going to see if this can solidify down that guy there, which it should in a classical

247
00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:55.810
sense.
