00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.540
All right, let's continue on our journey and running through different examples in relativistic mechanics,

2
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.760
so you can get used to trying to take all the puzzle pieces or tools we've put together in this course,

3
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.090
slapping together to see the big picture and solve problems and do different kind of analysis.

4
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:43.310
OK, now the problem which we're going to work on today in this video is that of a lambda particle.

5
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.620
Now what you're going to learn in maybe quantum mechanics or a particle physics course is that this

6
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.490
particle known as a land, a particle, it's a subatomic particle.

7
00:00:52.700 --> 00:01:02.060
Sometimes it's going to spontaneously decay into two other subatomic particles a proton and a pion.

8
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.530
If the name is confusing, if you haven't seen this before, don't worry about that.

9
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.650
This sort of trying to emulate a real life situation, so there's some context behind it.

10
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.420
But if you don't get what's going on here, that's fine.

11
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.300
That's not the main inside.

12
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.520
This example, which to focus on are the parameters that are provided, such as the momentum, the mass,

13
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.320
so on and so forth.

14
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.980
OK.

15
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.130
So in this problem, states allow the particle is a subatomic particle, which can sometimes spontaneously

16
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.460
decay into a proton and a negatively charged pion, as depicted below.

17
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.010
The problem states that if the momentum of the outgoing particles in the same direction, so the traveling

18
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:53.270
in the same direction after decays are measured to be 581 mega electron volts over C and 256 mega electron

19
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.270
volts, or C proton.

20
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.630
The Pi on respectively determined the mess of the lambda particle.

21
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.940
Now this kind of problem is pretty cool because in a real life situation, it's pretty easy to measure

22
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.170
the momentum of particles flying through different apparatuses.

23
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.710
Right?

24
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.630
For example, if we had a magnetic field that was going into the board as such, and I'm just providing

25
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.240
some context and cool context to the problem before we actually run through it, what we would find

26
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.430
is that these guys driving in this direction.

27
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.590
Remember what I said about the Reds force?

28
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.460
We had a force equal to Q V Cross B as such.

29
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.450
So the R A V crossed B, right?

30
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.010
We're going to get a vector if it goes up or down, depending on whether goes into the board or it comes

31
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.880
out OK.

32
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.020
So as a result of that, we're going to get some force that one, this is moving.

33
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.760
It wants to push it up.

34
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.450
And what's going to happen is the particle is going to curve.

35
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.920
You're going to get some curvature.

36
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.990
What you can do, you can measure the radius of that curvature.

37
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.690
And there are different parameters, different equations you can derive to figure out how you can link

38
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.410
all these guys.

39
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.700
But using that, you can figure out pretty precisely the velocity here and that can tell you the momentum

40
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.410
pretty easily, OK?

41
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.830
So.

42
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.290
In a real life situation, you can use everything we're going to do in this problem to actually determine

43
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.010
and measure the mass of a particle that decays or some initial particle very accurately.

44
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.470
So this kind of problem is very practical.

45
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.890
It gives you an opportunity to practice special relativity, but it's also something you could employ

46
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.270
in a real life situation.

47
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.760
OK, so you know, all these problems, and I consider this sort of like the first challenging, somewhat

48
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.550
challenging problem we've ran through example problem.

49
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.000
What you want to do is you want to take all the promise.

50
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.200
You're given all the puzzle pieces and collect them and document them.

51
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.470
Right.

52
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.550
So these problems sometimes become a problem of accounting.

53
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.620
OK, so what I like to do is when I wrote up my problem statements, I only got a column where I have

54
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.670
given parameters.

55
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.500
I'm going to use this as such, and I write down literally what I had.

56
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:28.210
We were given the momentum of the proton and the pion as such and what we can do or what you will be

57
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.940
doing and a lot of special relativity problems is you will be looking at the masses, all the different

58
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.970
particles that are associated in this problem and that is usually your first step in your giving.

59
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.820
So you would want to look up the proton.

60
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.750
You can look up.

61
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.530
It's nice.

62
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:51.460
It's 938 megawatt, Turnbull's prestige squared, and you could also look up the pylon in a particle

63
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.120
physics book.

64
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.600
Or you can use Google to look it up pretty quickly.

65
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.750
So the mass of a pion, if you did that, you fine.

66
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.730
It's 140 mega electron volts overseas, where if you want to pause this video and try and confirm this.

67
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.150
See if you can find that it should be pretty close.

68
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.180
You might have small discrepancies based upon your source and the level of accuracy associated with

69
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.220
that measurement, but you should be able to look.

70
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.890
These are pretty easy to get used to doing that.

71
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.590
Be comfortable looking up the mess of different particles when you're doing special relativity problems.

72
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.400
OK, so next what you want to do is you have all the puzzle pieces laid out.

73
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.650
Now you want to see, OK, are they compatible?

74
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.560
How can they fit together with the tools I have?

75
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.290
I'll be providing you with the equation sheet.

76
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.540
You should use an equation sheet.

77
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.210
So, you know, you say, Oh, I got these variables, how can I fit them in with my different tools

78
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.000
to paint a picture of what's going on here?

79
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.080
And if you do that, you'll say, OK, I have the momentum.

80
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.230
I have mass.

81
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.550
Well, if I take our energy momentum relationship that we derive previously, I can determine the total

82
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:06.140
energy because in this recipe for a puzzle, right, we have this puzzle piece with the the momentum

83
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.110
we have the rest energy with mass.

84
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.150
The only unknown is the energy.

85
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.300
So I could use this plug and shock to figure out the energy of both particles at the end.

86
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.460
OK, and then maybe I can use conservation of energy, but let's focus on this initial part.

87
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.680
OK, so we could take this guy.

88
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.990
And again, as I said, we know PC and M.S. Square the rest of energy for both particles.

89
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.500
What we can do is you take a square root on both sides.

90
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.570
We end up with this guy right here.

91
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.780
All we need to do is just plug and chug.

92
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.230
All right.

93
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.950
So we do it for both particles to figure out the total energy of both these guys.

94
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.510
And what we find is that the proton, right?

95
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.250
We plug in PPC and PC squared into the equation.

96
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.180
We got 581 for the momentum.

97
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.430
And again, this shows the analytical efficiency associated with the units we're using here because

98
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.950
again, PC, the C cancels out.

99
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.480
We kick that guy out.

100
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.560
We get the energy term thoroughly for the mass.

101
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:13.820
The rest energy 938 mega electron volts per squared band kicked out C squared out.

102
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:15.530
We got the energy right there.

103
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.560
So we take this expression, we evaluate it.

104
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.730
And the result we end up with the total energy is 11 03 mega electron volts for that proton.

105
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.390
OK.

106
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:32.150
From a negatively charged PI on what we end up with, we do the same exact exercise.

107
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.560
We have this equation here.

108
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.810
We plug in should plug in those parameters.

109
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.140
We take the momentum of the power and that's the pion.

110
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.340
Put these guys in.

111
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.360
We kick off their C or C squared terms and we end up with the following.

112
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:52.460
So this guy becomes 256 mega electron volts squared and then this guy becomes 140 mega electron volts

113
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:52.910
squared.

114
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.520
We add them together.

115
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.420
Take the square root bam.

116
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:03.680
We figure out that the PI on has a total energy of two hundred and ninety two mega electron volts.

117
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.800
Now we want to take a pause and say, OK, we know the energy, we know the momentum, we know the mass

118
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.880
of the products.

119
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.870
How do we figure out the mass of the parent particle, the lambda particle?

120
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.130
How do we do that?

121
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.440
Well, what we can do is we can say what?

122
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.800
What kind of tools do we have?

123
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:28.820
Well, we know from conservation of energy that the initial energy must be equal to the final energy

124
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.570
because we cannot really create nor destroy energy, right?

125
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.130
We may convert between different types, but we cannot create or destroy it.

126
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.500
So we would expect that if we took conservation of energy, we know the end products right here.

127
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:48.690
We could figure out the initial product of Lambda Guy, and that's the approach we want to take.

128
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.320
OK, so we could figure out energy.

129
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:52.280
Let's do that.

130
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.000
All right.

131
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.210
The initial energy must equal the final energy.

132
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.510
And we know that initially we had the energy of the land, the particle that decays, and then we get

133
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.290
these guys right.

134
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:11.270
So initially we had the land particle and that has to be converted into the energy of a proton and the

135
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.110
energy of the plant.

136
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:16.970
Again, this is going to the rest, the energy and the kinetic energy of this guy.

137
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:23.630
And we know from previous studies that if this guy was at rest, some of the best inside of it would

138
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.720
have to be converted to kinetic energy.

139
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.730
It would have to be utilized, right?

140
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.080
We saw that previously.

141
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:37.510
And that's why conservation of mass tenant hold, we see that full force right here in this equation.

142
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.430
OK, so we got this guy.

143
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:46.730
We can determine the energy of this initially by literally adding the two to energy as we determine

144
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:47.390
so.

145
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.410
The energy, the proton from the energy and pylon, we plugged them straight in 11 or three million

146
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.710
electron volts, plus 292 mega electron volts band.

147
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:03.860
We got the total energy of our initial system of that lambda particle, which is thirteen ninety five

148
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.660
mega electron volts.

149
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.290
Now the next thing you must be thinking, OK, we want to find the mass.

150
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.260
This guy pretty accurately.

151
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.670
And that's sort of the intent of an experiment of this nature where we have these different parameters

152
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.780
that we're measured.

153
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.270
What in the world do we do?

154
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.240
What what do we do?

155
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.740
I have the energy.

156
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:22.820
How can I get the mass?

157
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:27.350
Well, this is the total energy, so I can't really use the rest energy.

158
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.390
I would need the kinetic energy.

159
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.000
But what do I know?

160
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:31.640
I know.

161
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:38.990
The momentum of this guy in the mantle of this guy, and I know that I have another puzzle piece our

162
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:44.090
conservation law conservation momentum that says that momentum is conserved.

163
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:50.540
So the initial momentum of this guy must equal the final momentum of these two guys.

164
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:58.370
And what we see, if we do that, we can say the initial item by item item of the land.

165
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:04.490
The particle must equal the momentum of the proton and the momentum of the PI on some together.

166
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:06.080
Now we plug in shot.

167
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:15.140
So for a proton, we literally get 581 mega electron volts of C, plus the pilot 256 mega lightning

168
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.950
bolts oversea.

169
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.680
Add them together.

170
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.740
Bam, what do you get?

171
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.980
Yeah, this guy right here we get 837 mega electron volts over.

172
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.500
See?

173
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.580
And at this point, we should have a a ha moment.

174
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.120
We got.

175
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:30.110
We got energy.

176
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.490
We got momentum.

177
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.190
What's the third term we usually have in a relationship?

178
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.850
Oh, bam, that's the mass that we're looking for.

179
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.620
So we pull this trick out of our rat hat and we employ it.

180
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:45.860
Or, in other words, using the different metaphor, a different analogy.

181
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.050
We take this puzzle piece, combine it with these puzzle pieces.

182
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:57.350
We just arrived and we're going to get the full picture that full final picture we want regarding the

183
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.580
mass of this particle.

184
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:06.110
So when we do that, we know that e squared off lambda must equal the momentum of time C squared off

185
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.600
lambda, plus the rest the energy of lambda squared.

186
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.290
OK.

187
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.290
So if we take this, we want to isolate the mass.

188
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:17.720
What we could do is we could say e squared minus PC squared is equal to end, not c squared.

189
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.900
And I sort of skipped some steps here due to the size of my board.

190
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:23.300
But you can see what we're doing here, literally.

191
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:27.980
Again, e squared minus PC squared, we take the square root of them.

192
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.030
That's where we got this.

193
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.940
Then we end up with the energy squares we have to divide by a c squared and that guy sort of comes along

194
00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:35.540
for the ride.

195
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.370
We don't want to throw in the speed of light.

196
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.250
And again, this is what makes our units so useful.

197
00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.480
So this is a very easy calculation.

198
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.470
Again, all we need to do is plug in the unknowns that we get the final result.

199
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.430
So we know the total energy that 395 mega electron volts.

200
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.240
Square that term and then subtract the momentum.

201
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.780
Turn right.

202
00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:04.340
The CIA down here cancels out that the efficiency of our units, so we square that term and then track

203
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.060
it from this guy.

204
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.100
Take the square root and then on the outside, we divide by a C squared.

205
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.070
And the net effect is we have this nice, easy calculation which tells us precisely.

206
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:17.830
That's.

207
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:28.040
This guy, the mess is one thousand one hundred and sixteen mega electron volts per C squared.

208
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:28.640
So.

209
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:36.390
If whatever reason you determined an unknown particle without a previously calculated mass.

210
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.280
What you could do is, you know, you could get magnetic fields, you can measure the magnetic field.

211
00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.300
You can have these guys flying through that magnetic field.

212
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:54.900
And then when it decays right, you can measure literally literally measure the velocity by taking or

213
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.660
rather tracking the trajectory of that particle.

214
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.580
Figuring out the radius.

215
00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:01.000
Right.

216
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:06.490
You can figure out relativistic forces, you can use that Lawrence force.

217
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:15.790
And then you can backtrack the momentum and also the velocity and go through this little exercise here

218
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.840
to literally figure out with a very precise accuracy.

219
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.770
This will be tied to the way in which you measure that radius.

220
00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:30.010
If you have a good measurement of that radius, you get a very accurate measurement of the mass of this

221
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.460
guy.

222
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:40.240
And that's something you could do in a particle accelerator, a benchtop experiment, even maybe in

223
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.080
CERN somewhere.

224
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:48.520
But this would be a very useful tool for experimentally determining the mass of some of these particles.

225
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.910
And it could also allow you to identify different problems if you didn't even know what this was previously,

226
00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.980
how you could determine the mass and the pair that up with previously identified masses.

227
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:09.160
So, yes, this is an example of how you figure out how you would employ ideas and concepts and special

228
00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.930
relativity, but it's practical.

229
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:16.930
You could use it to turn the mass in and experiment so you can add this to your bag of tricks.

230
00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.130
Your bag of puzzle piece.

231
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.750
Right?

232
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:25.900
So that's special relativity of relativistic mechanics here at the two examples.

233
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:32.680
I love to show you how units really drove the analysis forward and how special relativity is really

234
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.740
trying to figure out how energy, momentum and rest energy come into play, how they can be related

235
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.440
and how it can use our conservation laws to pull out different parameters we're interested in.

236
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.840
And everything else is just literally bookkeeping and plugging and chugging.

237
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.260
All right.

238
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.340
I hope you enjoyed that.

239
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:51.790
VIDEO.

240
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.760
Next, we're going to take a look at something what's very interesting something known as a photon.

241
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:03.250
And we're going to figure out the energy of a massless particle.

242
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.360
Stay tuned.
