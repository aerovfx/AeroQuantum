1
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,510
All right.

2
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,240
And our last video, we invest a lot of time and energy and putting together this nice relationship

3
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,410
between momentum and energy, and in doing so, it gave us really two main advantages.

4
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,750
What exactly were they?

5
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,600
Number one, the first advantage we got is that we were able to determine this invariant quantity that

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,200
is true in any reference frame, regardless of how an event is perceived or the perspective that actually

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:42,710
viewed it.

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,550
OK.

9
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:50,330
In other words, it allowed us to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions or perspectives.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,780
In addition to this, I also noted that it gave us a lot of analytical leverage and ability such that

11
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,510
we can run through problems more efficiently.

12
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,150
However, I haven't really demonstrated that.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,880
So what I want to do is I want to take everything we've been doing, including this relationship, all

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,010
the equations we've put together, all the ideas, all the concepts, and I want to sort of bring them

15
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:19,040
into the full picture right here into this this lesson by running through some example problems that

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,030
really highlights the anukul efficiency and ability we obtain from all these relationships, ideas,

17
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,600
concepts, so on and so forth in particular.

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,540
So you can get comfortable with doing calculations in special relativity, right?

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,150
What I like to like and what we've done is putting together all these different puzzle pieces to the

20
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,280
full puzzle, the full picture.

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,600
Now what we're going to do is we're going to take this puzzle pieces, drop them into place, see how

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,980
they interact with one another.

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,200
And in doing so, this is going to show the big picture is going to have everything come together,

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:56,420
and it's going to give you that nice aha moment in showing you how to run through different special

25
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,850
relativity problems.

26
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,220
OK?

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,320
So the first problem we're going to run through is it's pretty simple, pretty straightforward.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,310
It's going to build off of what we did maybe a few videos ago.

29
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:14,780
If you recall, we looked at an electron that had some kind of velocity and we determine its mass,

30
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,540
which then allowed us to determine its energy.

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:23,870
And I showed you the different units we were able to to use with that, and I said that would be a better

32
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,590
unit using in our analysis.

33
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,750
Let's jump into the problem.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,060
Let's see how that helps us run through this quickly, given the different tools, the different puzzle

35
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,130
pieces we've put together, OK?

36
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,920
So the primary to look at, as I mentioned, is the like John.

37
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:45,440
And the problem statement says that if an electron e is moving with a total energy e of 1.3 mega electron

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,720
volts, and that's the new unit we're using for energy recall, we talked about the electron volt previously.

39
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:56,600
What we want to do is determine its momentum, speed and kinetic energy.

40
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,330
Now is these three quantities we're trying to determine.

41
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:04,220
And I'm sort of guiding you through the problem because in order to determine the kinetic energy, what

42
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,720
you're going to find is we would need to run through all these things before it in order to get some

43
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,050
information that would allow us to determine that kinetic energy.

44
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,310
So is a quick picture of what we're seeing.

45
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:19,880
We have an electron, we some velocity b we don't know what that is, but we know the total energy.

46
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,760
Perhaps we measured that perhaps somebody gave it to us.

47
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,580
Who knows, but we have this, this quantity here.

48
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:33,590
So first thing we want to do if we have an electron and we know its total energy, we also know it's

49
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,420
rest energy because as you know, previously, well, we calculated it.

50
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,490
But when you run into these problems, what you want to do is you want to get that mass, the mass or

51
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,090
the rest energy of that particle so we can look up an electron.

52
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,200
We know the electrons.

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,110
That's energy is zero point five one one mega electron volts over C square.

54
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,400
That new unit we used and if we know the rest energy and we know the total energy, we want to figure

55
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,120
out the momentum.

56
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,890
Well, there's only one missing thing we have in the moment of energy relation we put together previously,

57
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,100
right?

58
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,320
We have this guy here.

59
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:17,660
So what you'll find is that in all these problems, if you have energy, you want to get momentum,

60
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:23,570
you want to get rest mass and then you can all throw those puzzles puzzle pieces into this nice equation

61
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,480
here and here to any missing entity.

62
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:28,130
OK, so we're missing the latter.

63
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,770
So what we could do is we can isolate this PC term, throwing these values we have previously and then

64
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,870
plug and chug and get a result.

65
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:40,640
Let's do that right now so we can take the main relationship right here.

66
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,460
We can say, OK, I'm a PC squared.

67
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,010
I'm going to sort of flip this guy, subtract and that's the square from the E Square over here, and

68
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,230
we have to take a square root to get rid of this guy.

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,750
And it's the relationship we get.

70
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,810
We have all these quantities we can plug them in.

71
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,340
We can solve a problem.

72
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,220
Now, when we plug these guys in, this is going to really highlight the elegance of expressing mass

73
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,840
and shortly momentum with this new different unit here.

74
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,580
But we haven't seen this come into play.

75
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,800
We haven't seen this in action really yet.

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,850
Very briefly.

77
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,450
OK.

78
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,280
So let's plug in Chuck Energy total.

79
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,570
1.3 million electron volts, plus that guy in here squared subtract, we need the rest energy.

80
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,700
So what we can do is we plug in the mass.

81
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,440
Point five, one one.

82
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:36,760
That's the rest, mass, of course, as mega electron volts over C squared and you multiply by C squared.

83
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,260
And what's really cool is you see what that guy pops off.

84
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,900
We don't have to do any insane calculations.

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,640
We don't have to do a lot of work.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,210
It's right there.

87
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,530
We're sort of priming the fact that we want to use it for energy.

88
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,730
So we express in terms of energy units over C squared.

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,910
And when we take this, this expression here.

90
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,060
And we throw it into a calculator, a Wolfram Alpha Mathematica.

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,040
My personal fear MATLAB.

92
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,820
What are you going to end up with is we saw for PC.

93
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,260
It's an energy term and we get a one point two mega electron volts.

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,840
So I know what you're thinking about.

95
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,630
Whoa, wait.

96
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,770
A second, probably thinking we were all that's on.

97
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,320
What in the world is this PC PC?

98
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,450
What does that mean?

99
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,710
Well, what I'm going to say is just like rest mass.

100
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,970
How KG were not very useful?

101
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,070
Well, we're going to see what momentum, you know, kg meter per second are, you know, Marston's

102
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,640
velocity.

103
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,270
I don't want to have to convert to electron volts.

104
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,650
That's going to take a lot of work.

105
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,310
So what we could do is we could say, OK, let's formulate a new unit of measurement for momentum.

106
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,490
By literally looking at usually we're going to use this relationship, so we're going to prime the unit

107
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,160
to be compatible with this information.

108
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,320
So let's just divide by AC and the momentum we get.

109
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,740
And this is how momentum is expressed in special relativity is just one way to make electron volts per

110
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,100
seat.

111
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,730
OK.

112
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,820
OK.

113
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,300
This is a more conventional measurement, because if we're doing these calculations, the special relativity,

114
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,780
all we need to do is we take this guy, we multiply by C and we get the energy unit back.

115
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,330
And it's very convenient, right?

116
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,600
It boosts our analytical efficiency.

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,150
In essence, you can see that I play.

118
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,410
You can see that I play.

119
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,700
So we're making good progress.

120
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:35,140
We got one parameter down.

121
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,440
The next thing you want to do after, you know, momentum, we can take advantage of that next relationship.

122
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,960
We had to determine velocity, right?

123
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,750
Because as I said, we had a dimensionless.

124
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,850
Relationship dimensionless quantity.

125
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,600
Which expressed the relative velocity v over C or beta.

126
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,460
As being equal to pissy over eat.

127
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:07,080
So we have all these quantities, we can put them in and quickly figure out the speed or the velocity,

128
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,340
the magnitude of velocity.

129
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,800
So we plug in.

130
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:19,080
This guy right here we can I can show you the analytical awesomeness of this firsthand, right?

131
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,720
So momentum is one million electron volts over.

132
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,430
See you plug in for P.

133
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:30,690
We're going to see and we see again, just like with rest energy, the CS cancel and we get that energy

134
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,770
unit back.

135
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,250
And then we want to divide by the total energy which we know to be 1.3 million electron volts.

136
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,500
Again, evaluate this guy.

137
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,340
What do you get?

138
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,020
We get a pretty high relative.

139
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,910
Last we had a relative velocity.

140
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,940
And this is not surprising because we're dealing about subatomic particle.

141
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,730
We get a velocity of 0.9 two and we can either use that later on in our calculations.

142
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:05,520
Or we can say, Oh, we we just take the C over here and we can express the speed as 0.9 to see band

143
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,230
two thirds of the problem done.

144
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,210
Now men are the problem is trying to figure out the kinetic energy.

145
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,570
And I don't have it written up here because I'm limited on board space.

146
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:23,940
But where I want to recall is that kinetic energy, as we defined it was gamma minus one.

147
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,100
And the rest, energy and Moxie Square.

148
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,210
OK.

149
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,660
So in other words, you're taking the total energy, subtracting the rest of energy, and we get this

150
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,380
equation here.

151
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,500
So what we could do is we could take e, we could take the rest of energy here because subtract them.

152
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,470
And that will give us the result, because, you know, there are multiple ways to do that, so we could

153
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:57,270
do we could say energy is equal to you and not c squared plus kinetic energy.

154
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,380
And we know this guy, we know this guy that could solve it.

155
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,740
Why don't I try and use the equation we put together to give you some more practice with using these

156
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:07,920
guys?

157
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,050
So obviously we need to figure out how the magnitude of relativistic effects.

158
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,310
So using this B, we could calculate gamma, right?

159
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,440
That could give us information about, Oh, maybe you want to see if there's a time difference in the

160
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,140
reference frame moving with the electron?

161
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,880
I want to see if there's some kind of time dilation going on or length contraction.

162
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,570
We would need this guy so we could use all this stuff to figure out the velocity and then we have to

163
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,350
figure out gamma.

164
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,110
Well, we call gamma.

165
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,580
Gamma is nothing more than one over the square root of one, minus the relative velocity squared, beta

166
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,000
squared.

167
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,310
So we got this guy.

168
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,060
We can literally plug it straight in plug and shock, baby.

169
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,590
So we take one.

170
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,860
We divide by the square root of one minus beta squared.

171
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,080
We plug in that point nine to you.

172
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,100
We square it.

173
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:06,370
And we get up a gamma value of 2.5 five, which is, you know, that's somewhat significant.

174
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:13,480
So we're going to see relativistic effects cropping up coming into play here, and we would expect some

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:20,410
kind of time dilation length contraction to occur and we expect somebody moving in this reference frame

176
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:27,190
to have a different experience than somebody else who is perhaps stationary or moving at a different

177
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,850
speed.

178
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,640
OK, so we could use this for all those calculations.

179
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,710
We're going to figure out the kinetic energy.

180
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,990
So what we need to do to figure that out is take this guy, plug it in here.

181
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,140
And when we do that, we get a 2.5 five minus one.

182
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,100
And then we want to multiply by the rest energy.

183
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:55,030
And since you've seen previously how the Sea Square cancels with that guy right there, I'm going to

184
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,830
see what I would typically do.

185
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,770
I wouldn't write this out because that's a little inconvenient.

186
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,840
So what I say is, Oh, we got a c squared and I just can't in my head.

187
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,540
Easy peasy, right?

188
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,180
So it ends up becoming this guy.

189
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,530
Times zero point five one one.

190
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,140
Mega electron volts.

191
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:26,090
And when we do that, that calculation, we end up with again, we got an energy union right there because

192
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:36,500
the seas are canceled, that guy, we end up with a kinetic energy of zero point seven nine two mega

193
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,570
electron volts.

194
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:48,430
OK, so that's the energy we get that is composed due to its velocity.

195
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,500
We got that nice guy right there.

196
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,420
And as a check.

197
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,250
What we could do is we could say, well, if we take this and add the rest of energy, that should equal

198
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,090
the total energy.

199
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:06,200
So OK, that's about point one plus point five.

200
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,020
Oh, that's one point three million electron volts.

201
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,380
So yes, we're doing this correctly.

202
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,540
That strengthens our confidence and.

203
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,340
What's the first problem we ran through in relativistic mechanics besides, you know, we ran through

204
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:29,330
the energy problem, but you can see here how our modifications to units, our relationships and our

205
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,090
momentum really drive the analysis forward.

206
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:32,600
Right.

207
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,360
This is a useful tool used for useful puzzle piece, which gives us a huge glimpse into the full picture,

208
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,010
right?

209
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,490
So when you solve all these problems and we're going to run through another one a bit more complex shortly,

210
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,250
what you want to do is you want to say, OK, I have all these tools, I have all these puzzle pieces.

211
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,730
How can I rearrange them and put them together?

212
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,290
How can they interact with one another?

213
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,910
So should I put the full picture together of what's happening in this example problem?

214
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,080
OK, so if you get lost in any kind of problem, what you should do is you say, OK, maybe I have energy

215
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,140
no matter what, let's calculate the energy.

216
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,820
Let's calculate the momentum.

217
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:17,630
Let's calculate the velocity to each one and then question, OK, they gave me another puzzle piece

218
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,060
How can I fit that in with the other puzzle pieces?

219
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,100
I have to see the full picture.

220
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,640
OK.

221
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,580
So remember, we're always going to be using conservation of energy, so relationship conservation of

222
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,470
momentum, so on and so forth.

223
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,510
And that's the name of the game in special relativity and relativistic mechanics.

224
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,260
OK, let's jump into another example problem.
