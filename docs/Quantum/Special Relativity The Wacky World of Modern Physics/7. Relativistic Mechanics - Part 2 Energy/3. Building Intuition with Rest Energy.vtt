1
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.690
All right.

2
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.230
And our last video we made quite a big discovery.

3
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.190
What do we find?

4
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:29.000
We found that by simply redefining our conception of space time off everything around us that introduced

5
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.040
this huge ripple effect into our understanding of mechanics and in particular, energy.

6
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.450
Let's take a closer look at that ripple effect and try to understand the implications it provides.

7
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.070
So we found that mass is nothing more than a manifestation of energy that energy and mass are inseparable,

8
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.060
that in essence they're the same thing.

9
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.060
Now, when you hear that, that's quite a big assertion, right?

10
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.960
Usually we take any everyday household item.

11
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.430
We say it has mass.

12
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.900
And if we take like heat, for example, that's energy and they seem to be separate concepts.

13
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.890
However, we found that again, by making this slight modification of space time, we find that mass

14
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.660
and energy are equivalent.

15
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.900
OK, so what I want to do in this video is sort of help you understand that even though an object may

16
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.730
not have any kind of lost your kinetic energy, it still has less energy.

17
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.070
It still has some kind of energy.

18
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.200
And the fact that it exists, its mass is a manifestation of that energy.

19
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.530
Right.

20
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.510
This is an expression of energy.

21
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.990
So I want to help you quantify how much energy is actually contained in everyday household items and

22
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:43.100
everyday mass and give you a better sense of intuition, a better sense of understanding of what exactly

23
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.080
we're talking about here.

24
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.510
So to do that, to quantify the magnitude of this energy.

25
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:56.090
If you're in an everyday items, let's see how much rest energy is inherent in one gram of mass now

26
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.170
one gram of mass.

27
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.400
It's not a lot of mass.

28
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.210
This can correspond to everyday household items, such as a small paperclip.

29
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.710
Yes, this is one gram of mass.

30
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.830
How much energy is inside it?

31
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.790
It's a lot.

32
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.320
We could possibly harness that user for more practical reasons than just a boring old little paperclip.

33
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.930
Another example of a household item that has one gram of mass is a dollar bill, any kind of U.S. issued

34
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.040
bill currency.

35
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.520
So, you know, depending upon how much energy is in this, it may be $1 or if you could harness the

36
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.690
energy inside the mass that value in hearing it may far surpass the monetary value of this this household

37
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.200
item.

38
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.230
So let's take what we discovered and explore how much energy is composed in these items.

39
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.040
So to do that, what we do is we take our energy for oil.

40
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.290
We just derive from Einstein.

41
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.950
E is equal to the rest mass and not tiny c squared.

42
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.140
We literally just plug in shot.

43
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.760
It's a very simple calculation.

44
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.240
So if we're trying to figure out the rest energy in one gram of mass, no matter what we do, and we

45
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:16.160
plug in one gram for the rest mass and not what we need to do is we need to convert two kilograms because

46
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.770
we express energy in terms of joules.

47
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.370
So, you know, a jewel is a new meter and a new one is a kilogram times meter per second squared.

48
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.120
So to convert it, we just multiply by one kilogram or a thousand grams and then we multiply by the

49
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.990
speed of light three times 10 to the eight meters per second.

50
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.880
We square that term.

51
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.070
And then what we need to do is convert to our energy terms.

52
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.060
So as I just said, one fuel is equal to one kilogram meter squared per second squared or one meter.

53
00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.980
We take that conversion factor.

54
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.340
Plug into this into a calculator MATLAB, Mathematica, even Wolfram Alpha, whatever you want to use.

55
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.250
And that's going to split all this result here, which tells us a very interesting fact.

56
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:08.150
We find that a one gram of mass, just this little paperclip right here, little small paperclip.

57
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.140
We get nine times 10 to the 13 joules of energy.

58
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.420
That's an insane amount of energy.

59
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.730
So we find that in the macroscopic world, the energy contained within a small amount of mass or the

60
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.940
mass is a crap ton of energy.

61
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.680
This is a huge amount of energy.

62
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.070
To put this into perspective, this amount of energy is equivalent to two times the energy released

63
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.870
by the Hiroshima atomic bomb and 100000 times the kinetic energy of a large aircraft carrier such as

64
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.950
an F-35.

65
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.830
Cool aircraft carriers that do really cool maneuvers.

66
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.690
That's a lot of frickin energy, but it's all contained in this little paper clip.

67
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.030
Or a U.S. dollar bill.

68
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.140
So when you hear about that, you say, wait a second, this one dollar bill, it's only one dollar.

69
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.830
The energy contained in this math far, far exceeds the monetary value of this little dollar.

70
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.020
Yes, that's a lot of energy.

71
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.050
If you could somehow take all this math and figure out a way to annihilate it and convert it from the

72
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.150
mass into a massive energy such as maybe radiation, so on and so forth.

73
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.960
Right.

74
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:29.340
This occurs when you take an electron and a positron acquired and they release radiation radiative energy.

75
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.180
You could have a value inside of the star that far exceeds that one U.S. dollar monetary value.

76
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.800
So that's pretty interesting.

77
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:37.680
And this is why.

78
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:47.900
The power inherent in atomic bombs and nuclear power plants are so coveted, it's it's it's such an

79
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:55.880
effective way of generating electricity and energy that we use as humans every day in particular.

80
00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.150
This is so powerful that the sun through fission and fusion, actually, it's using fusion.

81
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:11.240
I believe the Sun is able to provide energy for the entire solar system by taking mass particular hydrogen,

82
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.610
annihilating it and converting it into the energy that's instilled in that mass.

83
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:24.050
So we find that in a macroscopic scale, all this energy exceeds a lot of energy, even a small little

84
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.650
amount of mass.

85
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.640
We can take a little bit of a mass and produce a crap ton of energy.

86
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:35.420
OK, so this is why nuclear energy and what Einstein discovered is so important.

87
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.280
So absolutely amazing.

88
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.050
But what I want to pull your time to next is a different perspective.

89
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.140
We looked at the macroscopic world and we find that there's a crap ton of energy contained in a small

90
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.980
amount of mass.

91
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.170
Let's look at the microscopic world.

92
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.470
You know, when we do calculations of physics, such as in CERN, if you haven't heard about a particle

93
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.840
accelerator where we accelerate particles, they collide and we analyzed the products of those collisions,

94
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.930
what actually happens in the microscopic world?

95
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.410
A lot of the particles subatomic particles are moving at very high speeds close to the speed of light.

96
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.890
So you would expect relativistic effects that we've been talking about on this course will be more prevalent

97
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.050
and crop up in that kind of scenario.

98
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:28.070
However, contrary to the macroscopic world, the mass is much, much smaller, right in the microscopic

99
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.330
world where most objects have much less mass will move close to the speed of light.

100
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.310
What we would expect is that the rest energy would be much smaller than what we just calculated here.

101
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.130
Even though, you know, relative relativistic effects, as I just talked about or more prevalent.

102
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:51.730
So to take a look at this and compare it to the energy and hear it in a dollar bill and a paperclip.

103
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.060
Very small items.

104
00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:02.180
Let's calculate the rest energy of an electron, something that we use a lot in particle physics and

105
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.490
then we're dealing with special relativity.

106
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.000
So the name of the game here is same exact thing.

107
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.140
We've had Eagles M.C. squared that this time we use the math of an electron.

108
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:20.300
We can look that up in a textbook has tabulated tables of mass, all these guys and we just plug straight

109
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.870
in and do the calculations.

110
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:28.320
So when we do that, we find that the mass of Electron is 9.1 has 10 to the minus 31 kilogram.

111
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.240
We see this.

112
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.790
This compared to one gram is much smaller, so we would expect, you know, this speed of light three

113
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.380
times 10 to the eighth squared.

114
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.250
All right.

115
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:42.110
This is going to far offset that huge value that gets provided from the speed of light and.

116
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.020
We back up a little bit, the speed of light is part partially responsible for this huge energy that

117
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.190
we get, but when we run this calculation, plug into the calculator, we end up with.

118
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:57.740
Yes, as we predicted, a much smaller energy which find not in the microscopic world.

119
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.170
The objects we deal with have much less mass, so they have much less rest, rest energy.

120
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:04.190
But we see this.

121
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:09.050
We see the result eight point one nine nine times 10 to the minus 14 joules.

122
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.300
That's a very small amount of energy.

123
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:19.340
And this really points to the fact that the fuel was really developed to measure things in a macroscopic

124
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:19.970
sense, right?

125
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.800
Right.

126
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:26.090
The tube was invented to do Newtonian mechanics, you know, looking at a car, moving the kinetic energy

127
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.420
of a car, moving maybe five miles per hour.

128
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.470
Things of that nature.

129
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:32.330
Big macroscopic objects.

130
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.310
And we use that in a practical sense when we're doing mechanical engineering and nuclear engineering,

131
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.180
not nuclear.

132
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.800
I meant to say chemical engineering things of that nature that are at a microscopic level.

133
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.200
So when we jump down here, we find that this energy unit is not.

134
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.570
It doesn't seem suited for these kind of calculations and we find is like this jewel.

135
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.150
It's the typical I unit for energy.

136
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.360
This is better suited for macroscopic events I just described.

137
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:07.370
And what we're going to find is that we want to take this, this energy here and express it a bit differently

138
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:15.260
so that, you know, it's closer to maybe one higher values that are more appropriate for these smaller

139
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.090
amounts of energy, at least for like one electron that we're going to be dealing with.

140
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:26.840
So what we're going to do next is I'm going to introduce you to the energy and sort of the mass units

141
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.820
that we're going to use for relativistic calculations, for particle physics, you name it.

142
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.290
And that is as we're going to find out right here, which is tabulated.

143
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.390
It's known as an electric vault.

144
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:43.100
Next, what we're going to do is I'm going to divide that for you, and I'm going to show you how the

145
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.470
electron comes into play to save the day here and sort of convert this energy unit into something that's

146
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:50.180
much more practical.

147
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.110
Stay tuned.
