### Đoạn 1

All right. And our last video, we invest a lot of time and energy and putting together this nice relationship between momentum and energy, and in doing so, it gave us really two main advantages. What exactly were they?

### Đoạn 2

Number one, the first advantage we got is that we were able to determine this invariant quantity that is true in any reference frame, regardless of how an event is perceived or the perspective that actually viewed it. OK.

### Đoạn 3

In other words, it allowed us to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions or perspectives. In addition to this, I also noted that it gave us a lot of analytical leverage and ability such that we can run through problems more efficiently. However, I haven't really demonstrated that.

### Đoạn 4

So what I want to do is I want to take everything we've been doing, including this relationship, all the equations we've put together, all the ideas, all the concepts, and I want to sort of bring them into the full picture right here into this this lesson by running through some example problems that really highlights the anukul efficiency and ability we obtain from all these relationships, ideas,

### Đoạn 5

concepts, so on and so forth in particular. So you can get comfortable with doing calculations in special relativity, right? What I like to like and what we've done is putting together all these different puzzle pieces to the full puzzle, the full picture.

### Đoạn 6

Now what we're going to do is we're going to take this puzzle pieces, drop them into place, see how they interact with one another. And in doing so, this is going to show the big picture is going to have everything come together, and it's going to give you that nice aha moment in showing you how to run through different special

### Đoạn 7

relativity problems. OK? So the first problem we're going to run through is it's pretty simple, pretty straightforward. It's going to build off of what we did maybe a few videos ago.

### Đoạn 8

If you recall, we looked at an electron that had some kind of velocity and we determine its mass, which then allowed us to determine its energy. And I showed you the different units we were able to to use with that, and I said that would be a better unit using in our analysis.

### Đoạn 9

Let's jump into the problem. Let's see how that helps us run through this quickly, given the different tools, the different puzzle pieces we've put together, OK? So the primary to look at, as I mentioned, is the like John.

### Đoạn 10

And the problem statement says that if an electron e is moving with a total energy e of 1.3 mega electron volts, and that's the new unit we're using for energy recall, we talked about the electron volt previously. What we want to do is determine its momentum, speed and kinetic energy. Now is these three quantities we're trying to determine.

### Đoạn 11

And I'm sort of guiding you through the problem because in order to determine the kinetic energy, what you're going to find is we would need to run through all these things before it in order to get some information that would allow us to determine that kinetic energy. So is a quick picture of what we're seeing.

### Đoạn 12

We have an electron, we some velocity b we don't know what that is, but we know the total energy. Perhaps we measured that perhaps somebody gave it to us. Who knows, but we have this, this quantity here. So first thing we want to do if we have an electron and we know its total energy, we also know it's

### Đoạn 13

rest energy because as you know, previously, well, we calculated it. But when you run into these problems, what you want to do is you want to get that mass, the mass or the rest energy of that particle so we can look up an electron. We know the electrons.

### Đoạn 14

That's energy is zero point five one one mega electron volts over C square. That new unit we used and if we know the rest energy and we know the total energy, we want to figure out the momentum. Well, there's only one missing thing we have in the moment of energy relation we put together previously,

### Đoạn 15

right? We have this guy here. So what you'll find is that in all these problems, if you have energy, you want to get momentum, you want to get rest mass and then you can all throw those puzzles puzzle pieces into this nice equation

### Đoạn 16

here and here to any missing entity. OK, so we're missing the latter. So what we could do is we can isolate this PC term, throwing these values we have previously and then plug and chug and get a result.

### Đoạn 17

Let's do that right now so we can take the main relationship right here. We can say, OK, I'm a PC squared. I'm going to sort of flip this guy, subtract and that's the square from the E Square over here, and we have to take a square root to get rid of this guy.

### Đoạn 18

And it's the relationship we get. We have all these quantities we can plug them in. We can solve a problem. Now, when we plug these guys in, this is going to really highlight the elegance of expressing mass

### Đoạn 19

and shortly momentum with this new different unit here. But we haven't seen this come into play. We haven't seen this in action really yet. Very briefly.

### Đoạn 20

OK. So let's plug in Chuck Energy total. 1.3 million electron volts, plus that guy in here squared subtract, we need the rest energy. So what we can do is we plug in the mass.

### Đoạn 21

Point five, one one. That's the rest, mass, of course, as mega electron volts over C squared and you multiply by C squared. And what's really cool is you see what that guy pops off. We don't have to do any insane calculations.

### Đoạn 22

We don't have to do a lot of work. It's right there. We're sort of priming the fact that we want to use it for energy. So we express in terms of energy units over C squared.

### Đoạn 23

And when we take this, this expression here. And we throw it into a calculator, a Wolfram Alpha Mathematica. My personal fear MATLAB. What are you going to end up with is we saw for PC.

### Đoạn 24

It's an energy term and we get a one point two mega electron volts. So I know what you're thinking about. Whoa, wait. A second, probably thinking we were all that's on.

### Đoạn 25

What in the world is this PC PC? What does that mean? Well, what I'm going to say is just like rest mass. How KG were not very useful?

### Đoạn 26

Well, we're going to see what momentum, you know, kg meter per second are, you know, Marston's velocity. I don't want to have to convert to electron volts. That's going to take a lot of work.

### Đoạn 27

So what we could do is we could say, OK, let's formulate a new unit of measurement for momentum. By literally looking at usually we're going to use this relationship, so we're going to prime the unit to be compatible with this information. So let's just divide by AC and the momentum we get.

### Đoạn 28

And this is how momentum is expressed in special relativity is just one way to make electron volts per seat. OK. OK.

### Đoạn 29

This is a more conventional measurement, because if we're doing these calculations, the special relativity, all we need to do is we take this guy, we multiply by C and we get the energy unit back. And it's very convenient, right? It boosts our analytical efficiency.

### Đoạn 30

In essence, you can see that I play. You can see that I play. So we're making good progress. We got one parameter down.

### Đoạn 31

The next thing you want to do after, you know, momentum, we can take advantage of that next relationship. We had to determine velocity, right? Because as I said, we had a dimensionless. Relationship dimensionless quantity.

### Đoạn 32

Which expressed the relative velocity v over C or beta. As being equal to pissy over eat. So we have all these quantities, we can put them in and quickly figure out the speed or the velocity, the magnitude of velocity.

### Đoạn 33

So we plug in. This guy right here we can I can show you the analytical awesomeness of this firsthand, right? So momentum is one million electron volts over. See you plug in for P.

### Đoạn 34

We're going to see and we see again, just like with rest energy, the CS cancel and we get that energy unit back. And then we want to divide by the total energy which we know to be 1.3 million electron volts. Again, evaluate this guy.

### Đoạn 35

What do you get? We get a pretty high relative. Last we had a relative velocity. And this is not surprising because we're dealing about subatomic particle.

### Đoạn 36

We get a velocity of 0.9 two and we can either use that later on in our calculations. Or we can say, Oh, we we just take the C over here and we can express the speed as 0.9 to see band two thirds of the problem done. Now men are the problem is trying to figure out the kinetic energy.

### Đoạn 37

And I don't have it written up here because I'm limited on board space. But where I want to recall is that kinetic energy, as we defined it was gamma minus one. And the rest, energy and Moxie Square. OK.

### Đoạn 38

So in other words, you're taking the total energy, subtracting the rest of energy, and we get this equation here. So what we could do is we could take e, we could take the rest of energy here because subtract them. And that will give us the result, because, you know, there are multiple ways to do that, so we could

### Đoạn 39

do we could say energy is equal to you and not c squared plus kinetic energy. And we know this guy, we know this guy that could solve it. Why don't I try and use the equation we put together to give you some more practice with using these guys?

### Đoạn 40

So obviously we need to figure out how the magnitude of relativistic effects. So using this B, we could calculate gamma, right? That could give us information about, Oh, maybe you want to see if there's a time difference in the reference frame moving with the electron?

### Đoạn 41

I want to see if there's some kind of time dilation going on or length contraction. We would need this guy so we could use all this stuff to figure out the velocity and then we have to figure out gamma. Well, we call gamma.

### Đoạn 42

Gamma is nothing more than one over the square root of one, minus the relative velocity squared, beta squared. So we got this guy. We can literally plug it straight in plug and shock, baby.

### Đoạn 43

So we take one. We divide by the square root of one minus beta squared. We plug in that point nine to you. We square it.

### Đoạn 44

And we get up a gamma value of 2.5 five, which is, you know, that's somewhat significant. So we're going to see relativistic effects cropping up coming into play here, and we would expect some kind of time dilation length contraction to occur and we expect somebody moving in this reference frame to have a different experience than somebody else who is perhaps stationary or moving at a different

### Đoạn 45

speed. OK, so we could use this for all those calculations. We're going to figure out the kinetic energy. So what we need to do to figure that out is take this guy, plug it in here.

### Đoạn 46

And when we do that, we get a 2.5 five minus one. And then we want to multiply by the rest energy. And since you've seen previously how the Sea Square cancels with that guy right there, I'm going to see what I would typically do.

### Đoạn 47

I wouldn't write this out because that's a little inconvenient. So what I say is, Oh, we got a c squared and I just can't in my head. Easy peasy, right? So it ends up becoming this guy.

### Đoạn 48

Times zero point five one one. Mega electron volts. And when we do that, that calculation, we end up with again, we got an energy union right there because the seas are canceled, that guy, we end up with a kinetic energy of zero point seven nine two mega

### Đoạn 49

electron volts. OK, so that's the energy we get that is composed due to its velocity. We got that nice guy right there. And as a check.

### Đoạn 50

What we could do is we could say, well, if we take this and add the rest of energy, that should equal the total energy. So OK, that's about point one plus point five. Oh, that's one point three million electron volts.

### Đoạn 51

So yes, we're doing this correctly. That strengthens our confidence and. What's the first problem we ran through in relativistic mechanics besides, you know, we ran through the energy problem, but you can see here how our modifications to units, our relationships and our

### Đoạn 52

momentum really drive the analysis forward. Right. This is a useful tool used for useful puzzle piece, which gives us a huge glimpse into the full picture, right?

### Đoạn 53

So when you solve all these problems and we're going to run through another one a bit more complex shortly, what you want to do is you want to say, OK, I have all these tools, I have all these puzzle pieces. How can I rearrange them and put them together? How can they interact with one another?

### Đoạn 54

So should I put the full picture together of what's happening in this example problem? OK, so if you get lost in any kind of problem, what you should do is you say, OK, maybe I have energy no matter what, let's calculate the energy. Let's calculate the momentum.

### Đoạn 55

Let's calculate the velocity to each one and then question, OK, they gave me another puzzle piece How can I fit that in with the other puzzle pieces? I have to see the full picture. OK.

### Đoạn 56

So remember, we're always going to be using conservation of energy, so relationship conservation of momentum, so on and so forth. And that's the name of the game in special relativity and relativistic mechanics. OK, let's jump into another example problem.
