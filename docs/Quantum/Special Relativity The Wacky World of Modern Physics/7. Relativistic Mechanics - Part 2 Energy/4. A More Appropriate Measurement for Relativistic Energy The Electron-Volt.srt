1
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,440
All right.

2
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,680
To derive that better measurement for microscopic levels that we're going to deal with primarily in

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,390
this course and in particle physics.

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,500
What I'm going to do is I'm going to walk you through some basic electrostatic, which you're usually

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,300
exposed to in electricity and magnetism course, which is usually traditionally in college.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,970
The second physics course you actually take.

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,610
So a lot of textbooks just throw this measurement out and expect you to use it.

8
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,840
I want you to have intuition.

9
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,360
I want you to understand where it came from and what it's actually communicating, what the measurement

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,730
the unit actually signifies, OK?

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,030
So what I'm going to do to find a more appropriate measurement for energy when I call our past studies

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:04,390
of electric circuits and the work that's required to move a charged particles, the scenario I want

13
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:09,610
you to consider is, let's say we have a congregation of point charges.

14
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,290
Q one two three four.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,340
How many charges you want anywhere in space.

16
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,460
This is going to signify surrounding environment charges.

17
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,880
And what we know is that any kind of charge is going to give off an electric field, which is specified

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,450
by E!

19
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:33,430
So these guys here, if we have a charged particle, which we're going to use as an electron Q and we

20
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:41,170
want to do work so we can move this from point A to point B, what's going to happen is any kind of

21
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,090
source charged with an electric field.

22
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,690
E is going to produce a force that either opposes or attracts this charge.

23
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:57,760
And what we know from the Lorenz Force Law, which I should underline right here, is that the force

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:06,280
that this electric field exerts on any kind of other charge Capital Q is Q times the electric field,

25
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,630
plus the velocity of the particle crossed into the magnetic field.

26
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,710
Now in this scenario.

27
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,900
We're going to assume there's no magnetic field, so this guy is going to drop off and we're left with

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,100
just Huie.

29
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:28,420
Now this guy is sort of if that doesn't look familiar to you and you've studied electrostatic, what

30
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,310
I want you to recall is that this is no different than after you put an E in the electric field.

31
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,550
You'd get this equation here one over four pi epsilon.

32
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,970
Not well, this is the permeability of space times.

33
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,240
The two charges Q Q, and this would be the sum of its the.

34
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,560
All these charges over the distance are square between the source and the point charge that you're interested

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:50,710
in.

36
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:56,500
What we see here is that it's sort of like the electric field is nothing more than the force over the

37
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:56,890
Q.

38
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:04,750
Now if we take this scenario and we want to move this guy over here, what we're doing is we're moving

39
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,890
this against the force that is created from these guys to see what's going to try to repel it.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,440
So we have to exert a force that is equivalent to Q times e or greater in the opposite direction to

41
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,880
move it along this guy here.

42
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,610
And what we know from physics went along with we've just studied in deriving the kinetic energy is that

43
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:30,910
any kind of work we exert or put into a system is defined as the integral from A to B, from the two

44
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:38,740
distances that the two displacements of the force data into the actual length that it moves along the

45
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,370
lever arm.

46
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,270
It moves along, right?

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,220
So if we move along this path, any kind of path we have to exert or rather the energy in the work we

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,270
put into in moving it is described by this equation.

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,460
We're going to do the same exact thing that we did with kinetic energy, with relativistic energy.

50
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,450
We're going to do is we'll plug into the forest and just plug plug in shock.

51
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,620
OK, so.

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,720
For the force, we know well, we just arrived the Lorentz force law here, Huey.

53
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,310
That's the force that we have to act against in moving these guys.

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,280
And it's sort of similar.

55
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,650
An analogy I'm going to take a little side is sort of similar to potential energy if that jives more

56
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,930
with you and you haven't studied this with potential energy.

57
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:28,200
What you do is if you have some kind of object here, you have a force of gravity that's acting down.

58
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,760
In order to move this to this position, we have to exert a force equivalent to the mass times, the

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,070
gravity, the force of gravity equal to, but opposite to move it up to there.

60
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,870
What are the same exact thing here?

61
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,230
All right.

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,680
It's the same exact parallel, same exact phenomenon that's going on here.

63
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,780
So we take the force here and it's going to be in the opposite direction.

64
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,070
So we put in a negative.

65
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,410
We pull that in here and we get an expression here that's like, Oh, that doesn't really that doesn't

66
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,690
really get us anywhere.

67
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,070
So we have to sort of chug along a bit further.

68
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,580
So what we can do is we can pull out this cue the negative Q.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,370
So this is a constant and we get this guy right here.

70
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:15,720
And if you studied electrostatic electric dynamics, this guy, this integral ETR should be a very special

71
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,060
special formula.

72
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,260
It should look like the formula for potential potential.

73
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,530
All right.

74
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,330
That's an important term.

75
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,980
An electrostatic but.

76
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:33,660
Well, we also know is that the electric field e is equivalent to the negative of a gradient of a potential

77
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,000
ft.

78
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,720
OK.

79
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,740
This is sort of like what we've seen in Physics 101 classical mechanics, where the force is equal to

80
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,590
the negative gradient of the potential energy.

81
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,980
And if we look at these two guys here, if this is confusing you.

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,800
This is no different than this guy.

83
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,140
In essence, it's just this the what if IQ, right?

84
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,930
The electric field is sort of like the force sport per charge, and that's useful because we just multiply

85
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,790
by any charge we want to see the force upon and that yields us, the force.

86
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,940
Similarly, the potential is sort of like the energy you divide up IQ.

87
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,690
OK, so.

88
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:18,230
If we take this guy here and we literally plug it in for Ether, the native grading of B, we get this

89
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:25,910
guy here and we could solve this because if we take the integral of a gradient over a distance D.R.

90
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,480
where we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus after we get rid of these negative signs, they

91
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,230
cancel out.

92
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,960
And the fundamental theorem of calculus says that if you integrate your gradient, you get nothing more

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,020
than the original quantity at the final result, minus the initial result, which is VB minus IPA.

94
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:52,460
So the net result we get is that in order to prove this charge against this electric field, we have

95
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:52,970
to.

96
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:01,880
Do the following work, the following work we do is the charge Q times, the change in potential, the

97
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,950
potential drop that we're moving across.

98
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:11,270
So if we take this, we can use it to formulate a new measurement of energy that's going to be more

99
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,640
applicable for the situation if we're going to be working with four microscopic scenarios.

100
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,010
Well, you know, we don't have a lot of mass, but we have very high velocities, OK?

101
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,570
So thus, if we try to move an electron across a potential difference of one volt, which is in essence

102
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:34,370
a potential drop, we can assert the following we could take a circuit.

103
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,200
We say we have some kind of battery of one volts and we can move across that volt.

104
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:46,310
The Bolt has an electro motor force and MF that wants to push this electron through the circuit, right?

105
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,540
That's how we get current.

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,110
That's how we get the flow of electrons of charges, charged particles.

107
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,940
So if we want to reverse that direction and go in the opposite direction, we're going to have to go

108
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,560
over one volt.

109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,390
We're going to have a one volt potential drop, the potential difference of one volt.

110
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,000
What's the energy we're going to need to put into the system?

111
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,650
We can use what we just arrive or taking a look at an electrostatic.

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,380
So we can take this exactly as it is for an electron and we just literally use it as such.

113
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,760
So we plug in the charge mcluhan's for an electron.

114
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,500
And you know, that's a negative charge.

115
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,880
So we get a negative one point six zero two two times 10 to the minus 19 coolant.

116
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:35,030
That's how we measure how we we measure, charge and we multiply that by our potential drop, which

117
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,500
is a negative one volt.

118
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:42,800
We know that a volt Coulomb is a jewel and we end up with the phone.

119
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,840
We get to work that is one point six, zero, two, two and 10 to the minus 19th joules.

120
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,850
And you're probably thinking scratching your head.

121
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,900
You're like, Wait a second.

122
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,440
That energy is close to the same magnitude we had previously.

123
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,110
Well, instead of using this, what we're going to do is want to say, Yeah, we're going to be working

124
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,160
with these charged particles.

125
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,390
We're going to be moving them around.

126
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,380
So maybe we can have a new unit using this as a reference.

127
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:12,620
So as I said, using this as reference, we could derive a more useful measurement known as the electron

128
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:12,860
volt.

129
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,570
This is the new unit of energy we're going to use in special relativity or news particle physics to

130
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,710
get used to it.

131
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,790
I'm going to help you get used to it.

132
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,650
OK, so we take this.

133
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,800
This is the energy or take movies over one voltage drop.

134
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:31,280
We take this and say one electric electron volts is going to be equal to this, this amount of energy

135
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,940
and joules.

136
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,460
And in doing so, we get this new measurement of energy.

137
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,500
OK, so it's a new measurement of energy.

138
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,620
It seems to be on the scale that we're seeing that's cropping up with these small particles.

139
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,010
However, you still do not have intuition with that, right?

140
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,820
So I'm going to erase this.

141
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,310
The circuit and what we're going to do is we're going to revisit the problem we were just describing

142
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,130
with the rest energy of an electron.

143
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,420
And what we want to find is that this gives us a really nice way to measure energy.

144
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,450
It's on the same scale of the situations that we generally analyze.

145
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:15,170
So what we can do is we could take we could say, Oh, previously we took the electron and we said it's

146
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:19,370
less energy is equal to N-not c squared.

147
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,500
But we already did our calculation, right?

148
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,590
Well, all of that, that was nearly eight point one nine nine.

149
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,920
Times.

150
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,010
Ten in the negative 14 jewels.

151
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,360
So how do we express this in terms of electron volts?

152
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,570
Well, we can say, OK, we can drop this down here to make more space.

153
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,020
That's merely just eight point one nine nine times 10 to the minus 14.

154
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,980
Is that correct?

155
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,570
Yes, it is joules.

156
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,640
And then we just use loo.

157
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,390
We just arrived.

158
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,110
So we multiply by one electron volt, which is what we want.

159
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:08,400
We divide by the one point six zero to two times 10 to the minus 19 joules.

160
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,900
We cancel out this macroscopic unit and we end up with red drum roll.

161
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,130
Five point one one times 10.

162
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:29,920
To the fifth election ballots and what you'll usually see this expressed as is the following we can

163
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,790
divide by bring this over here and then that becomes 10 to the six.

164
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:44,700
So that's just zero point five one one MAGA, which is 10 to the 6th electron volts band.

165
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,150
And we look at that.

166
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,350
When we see the first energy for an electron, your first calculation you've ever put into play here.

167
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,880
Is just following its, you know, 0.5 one mega electron wolf.

168
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,530
What are you there to work with this?

169
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,500
It's much more convenient because we don't have to put a times 10 to the minus 19 jewels all the time.

170
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:12,260
And furthermore, you know, if you didn't have a calculator would be much easier to work with this

171
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,040
breast energy here.

172
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,200
So we can see at a microscopic level with situations that we're going to deal with.

173
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:18,860
All right.

174
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:23,270
This guy is more useful, if more practical.

175
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:31,220
OK, now to go a step further and to really emphasize the energy mass equivalence that we just discovered.

176
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,970
What I've got to say is that all your calculations are going to do special relativity, particle physics,

177
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,680
so on and so forth, where relativistic effects tend to crop up.

178
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,040
We're going to express the energy in terms of the electron volts.

179
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,070
But when you expressed the mass, we're going to redefine units for mass and be very easy.

180
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,510
It's going to be very straightforward.

181
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,970
What we're going to say is that.

182
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,200
Instead of reporting the mass in terms of a kilogram and then we have to go through this insane operation,

183
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,560
we have a kg rate multiply by the speed of light squared.

184
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,970
We have to convert to electron volts.

185
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,960
That's a lot of work, right?

186
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,250
What I mean, more convenient.

187
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:21,280
If we said, Oh well, the mass, the mass of an electron is nothing more than 0.5 one one mega electron

188
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,860
volts overseas squirt.

189
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:29,020
Now it seems sort of weird to write it like that, but all I did was literally took the C squared what

190
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,720
we wrote left side hook that got divided by C squared and we ended up with falling.

191
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,700
What's really useful is that by taking this and you'll find tables and in your textbook online, so

192
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,150
on and so forth, you look up the massive electron in a special relativity book.

193
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,210
You're you should find this guy.

194
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:55,040
It's going means expressed in terms of electron volts over squared because we could just take this for

195
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,870
the rest energy.

196
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,730
We don't have to do any calculations.

197
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,640
They owe the rest energy, which we're going to find.

198
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,760
We're going to deal with energy in particular because we're just falling just 0.5 one meg electron volts

199
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,140
and you no calculation.

200
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,310
Let's do this year after year, the conversion do not to plug it into my calculator.

201
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,460
It's much more effective, much more practical.

202
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,590
After you get used to this, you're going to like it a bit much more.

203
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:25,960
OK, so we're going to do our calculations in terms of this, and what we're going to find is the energy

204
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,170
and momentum in particular and the rest of energy here.

205
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:35,670
This is going to really drive our calculations, drive our approach to analysis, and we're going to

206
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,500
try to get rid of our reliance upon math.

207
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Because as I mentioned in the previous video and we're going to explore in the next video is that if

208
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:53,170
mass is nothing more than a manifestation of energy and it can change freely between being mass or energy

209
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:58,000
or not, we shouldn't even think about as as such, mass literally is energy.

210
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,250
Mass is just our conception of energy, it's just an extra manifestation of it.

211
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:12,700
So if we can change freely, right, that sort of insinuates that conservation of mass no longer holds.

212
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,470
And on the going to divulge more about that, I talked about it a bit in the last video.

213
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,670
But if we can't rely upon that anymore, we can't use conservation of mass.

214
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:27,400
What we're going to see is really it's just basic physics principles, conservation of momentum, conservation

215
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,990
of energy and band.

216
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,110
So it's going to be more useful to express energy as such.

217
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,610
And we're going to find that we're going to redefine momentum units eventually.

218
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,890
And I'll make note of that when we do it, and it'll be more efficient to express a sort of in terms

219
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:44,290
of an electron volt calculation.

220
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,860
So there you have it, that is the electron volts.

221
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,970
I want to spend some time with the electrostatic.

222
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,470
If you're not really going to electrostatic, that's fine.

223
00:15:54,010 --> 00:16:00,850
Take what you will know that redefining energy to make it more appropriate for the scales in which we're

224
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,870
doing calculations.

225
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,720
And, yeah, a lot of textbooks really do not go through this exercise.

226
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,640
But I want you to understand that literally it's just we're saying, OK, we're dealing with charged

227
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,150
particles.

228
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,610
Let's figure out what the energy is to move it across a potential drop, something that we use on a

229
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,350
general basis.

230
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,850
And then we're just going to generalize it for our calculations of special relativity.

231
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,170
So that's electron volts.

232
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,140
That's what we're going to do.

233
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,000
We're going to explore a bit more this mass energy equivalence idea.

234
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:39,980
And I'm going to show you how mass yes, it's going to change really between being a new mass or manifestation

235
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,620
of energy to actually being release energy.

236
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:50,090
And in doing so, I hope you get more intuition, ballboy intuition with this idea and start feeling

237
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,900
more comfortable with this idea that Einstein introduced.

238
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,130
Stay tuned.
