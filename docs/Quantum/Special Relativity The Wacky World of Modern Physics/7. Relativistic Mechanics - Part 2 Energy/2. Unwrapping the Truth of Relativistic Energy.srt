1
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:23,750
All right, so we just did all that work, all that mathematics to derive this weird, odd result for

2
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,820
kinetic energy, which is as follows, which is defined as gamma minus one times and C squared.

3
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,840
Now, from a first glance at this, it seems like it doesn't look anything like our classical version

4
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,650
of kinetic energy.

5
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,450
You know, one half and squares when the world is going on here.

6
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,780
Let's try and understand this.

7
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,950
Let's unwrap this new equation using a binomial expansion.

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:52,010
What I'm going to say is that the answer and the meaning behind this is wrap underneath this result

9
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,790
within the individual binomial that the polynomials that can be used to express this and when we unwrap

10
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,130
it, when we unwrap those layers, it's going to become evident and it's going to become more clear.

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,250
But what we know right now is that we see this weird entity squared parameter popping out, and we do

12
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:16,100
see that relativistic effects that tend to occur at high velocities are popping up.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,140
So our intuition that if it's harder to push an object, a higher velocities to attain additional velocity,

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,060
then that must mean you any more and more energy to pump into a system to get an individual amount of

15
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:32,880
velocity.

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,860
Add it to it now.

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,120
If we take this and plot it up, we start to see the full picture.

18
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,200
And what I have here are plots showing the kinetic energy versus our relativistic velocity with a classical

19
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,610
and a relativistic result.

20
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,730
And what we're going to find by unwrapping the binomial expansion is that the relativistic and classical

21
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,430
result, which all work through shortly, do indeed convey the same result at low velocity.

22
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,970
So it does converge upon a classical result, which is good.

23
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,400
All results should do that and special relativity.

24
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,250
But what we see is that our intuition was indeed right as we get closer to the speed of light.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:18,230
We see that in order to increase the velocity a bit more, we have to build up more and more energy

26
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,500
in the y direction for each Delta X for each change of policy, which means that, you know, that's

27
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,390
really compensating for that additional inertia that builds up that we discovered with the momentum

28
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,200
equation.

29
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,560
Another interesting fact is that as we approach the speed of light, the energy goes to infinity.

30
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,250
So that sort of implies and this is not a direct result, but a sort of implies that we would need infinite

31
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,690
energy to reach the speed of light and go beyond it.

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,820
So that sort of is showing that.

33
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,870
The cap, the second part of the special relativity imposes upon a velocity as we start accelerating

34
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,960
it, saying that the loss cannot go beyond the speed of life is sort of showing up in our energy equation

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,480
because we would need infinite energy to go to the speed of light, which is an impossible fact.

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,590
I cannot happen, right?

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:17,040
So this is sort of showing that the second part of the special relativity, this cap on velocity gives

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,290
rise to relativistic effects in energy close to the speed of light, which is interesting.

39
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,050
But let's continue with unwrapping our equation and see what kind of information we can divulge that's

40
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,780
inherent within this result we got here.

41
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,620
So if you recall, maybe you studied the binomial expansion.

42
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,220
I hope you have.

43
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,640
If you have not, what its needs is that if we have this guy here, this polynomial OnePlus X to the

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,700
end, some kind of exponential power that can be expressed as the sum from K will zero to infinity of

45
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,780
an end, choose K to have these this polynomial x to the K.

46
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,670
So if we start putting out terms, the first term is the one we get an X.

47
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,360
You can see it builds up in power increase in power.

48
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,590
OK.

49
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:08,220
So in our case, what we have is this one over square root of one plus B or C squared one plus x two.

50
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,120
Basically, it's this guy here, which is equivalent to organic factor.

51
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,220
So we're going to have to make use of this and we're going to subtract one and then multiply by SC Square.

52
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,460
So if we plug in a negative one half, we get one here minus one half.

53
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,090
And I have to plug what happened to this guy, so it's a negative one half minus one, what is that?

54
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,100
That's make it three or two times negative one half.

55
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,930
So that's a three or four times at two.

56
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,810
So that's a three over eight and positive Times Square, and we could keep expanding this out until

57
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,530
infinity, right?

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,440
That's what I'm saying.

59
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:48,310
We're unwrapping we're pulling out all these polynomials to see how each turn comes into play here.

60
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,820
Well, what's really interesting is the reason why we like binomial expansions is because if X is really

61
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,380
small, that means if you square a very small number infinitely small, then it's going to be much smaller

62
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,680
magnitude than if you take the regular values.

63
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,990
Yes, x squared is much less than x OK.

64
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,590
I've shown this many times in my course on Lagrangian mechanics.

65
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,420
You could do an experiment, put in a small number in four x squared and compare it to the small number

66
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,840
itself.

67
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,860
It's going to be much smaller then if you cube it.

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,930
It's going to be even smaller.

69
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:31,070
So these guys sort of drop out and their effects do not become apparent until X becomes much larger.

70
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:38,030
OK, so what we're going to do is we're to take the limit as V is much less than C or if you ever see

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,040
approaches zero.

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,280
And when we do that, we can see that this guy and this guy are going to drop off their insanely small

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,300
when compared to this.

74
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,380
And we literally just end up with a falling so we can plug in x r.

75
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,340
You know, this guy, I'm going to write it out.

76
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,900
So the gamma.

77
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:03,680
And if you don't recall, is one over square root of one minus v overseas squared.

78
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,460
You should be super familiar with this guy.

79
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,350
This is the essence of special relativity, but if we take this, it's literally one minus this guy

80
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:17,560
squared to the negative one half so we can use the binomial expansion to express this in terms of the

81
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:17,890
phone.

82
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,680
So we have one that comes along for the ride.

83
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:26,080
And then the first leading term in terms of X, we plug this guy in a negative velocity square that

84
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:32,350
gives us a positive one half times the quantity VRC squared, plus all this massive.

85
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,170
It's super small in this limit.

86
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,640
OK, so we do that, we can use this to express this guy.

87
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,350
So this is no different than this guy minus one Times Square.

88
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:52,810
So the kinetic energy, the relativity kinetic energy is approximately equal to one plus one half times

89
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,800
B or C squared.

90
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,430
We're going to take that drop all the leading terms in this limit.

91
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:01,690
Subtract a one right here and then multiply by and c squared.

92
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,440
And when we do that, we see that the one cancels with the one.

93
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,520
And we end up with this term here.

94
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,620
So what's really interesting is we see a sea squared here and a sea squirt here.

95
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,380
All these guys are going to cancel out.

96
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,000
Bam, bam.

97
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,210
And what we end up with is a very, very interesting result, which I sort of hinted to at the beginning

98
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,460
with the grass one half in the square.

99
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,730
So at low velocities.

100
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:37,960
The relativistic equation does converge upon the result we expect won't have and B squared and as V

101
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,100
approaches the speed of light.

102
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,400
These terms here start to pick up pick up until they just blow up and go to infinity.

103
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,180
That's when it starts to diverge away from the classical result.

104
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,930
OK, so we see that what we obtained.

105
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:01,970
Jostle for intuition, as described here, drives off what we discovered with momentum and what we could

106
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,370
do is we're going to take this and we're going to try to unwrap it a bit further to see what else it

107
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,190
can divulge for us and what it's going to tell us.

108
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,120
What it's going to communicate is going to be mind boggling.

109
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,640
A huge, huge discovery that Einstein made an uncertain.

110
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:23,870
OK, so we're going to do that by rearranging the sky because we know this literally is our kinetic

111
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,860
energy of particles.

112
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,680
So if we take the kinetic energy and ANC squared up here, what we end up with is the following and

113
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,360
this is the important conclusion.

114
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,350
Pay attention.

115
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,860
So it states that Ghana and not c squared.

116
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,440
So I'm trying to emphasize that this is a rest mass mass you you measure when an object is at rest.

117
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,680
That is equal to M.C. squared, plus your kinetic energy.

118
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,280
OK.

119
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:55,630
And this is really interesting to spin the face of what we we observe in classical mechanics, what

120
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:00,540
we would say is that our total energy is going to be the change in the kinetic energy.

121
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,230
We didn't care about any kind of potential energy or any kind of reference.

122
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,710
We used to measure energy because energy is always measured in terms of our reference.

123
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,590
We are interested in the change in the kinetic energy, but what we see here is that there's much more

124
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,250
to energy than just, you know, the kinetic energy and the potential energy.

125
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,220
We get this guy here, which I'm going to assert as a rest energy.

126
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,660
I want to ask you the question What is this equation conveying to us?

127
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,810
What is it communicating?

128
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,290
It's basically asserting that mass is no different than a manifestation of energy.

129
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,740
Yes.

130
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,330
As Einstein stated, energy and mass are equivalent.

131
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:44,800
And when you hear that, that's that that's a mind shattering idea.

132
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,040
Right.

133
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,110
This goes outside of our conventions.

134
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,010
This was completely new for the day and age in which it was discovered.

135
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:58,480
But if we think about a lot of classical ideas, classical physics, it should not be that surprising,

136
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:58,710
right?

137
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,200
Because let's think about thermodynamics and thermodynamics.

138
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,350
We had this quantity in which we described matter and different compounds, so on and so forth, known

139
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,400
as internal energy and the change in internal energy, which was in essence, the energy composed inside

140
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,950
matter, inside atoms, so on and so forth.

141
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,370
The change in the internal energy gave rise to work, which we could use to generate electricity or

142
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,330
spin a shaft.

143
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,420
So on and so forth right now is the essence of thermodynamics.

144
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,290
So even back in the day of thermodynamics, we knew that matter in and of itself carried energy that

145
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,690
was sort of measured by temperature, right?

146
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,780
We use temperature and pressure along with different tables to look up internal energy of atoms and

147
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,250
mass and so on and so forth.

148
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,710
So this should not be super surprising.

149
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,800
What we're going to state is that all matter all mass, regardless of what it is throughout the universe,

150
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,850
has an inherent energy instantiate instantiated inside of it, right?

151
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,540
That mass is an expression of energy, in essence.

152
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,010
And what we're going to call it is a rest energy and not c squared.

153
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,920
Even when something is move is not moving.

154
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,610
It has inherent energy and it's quite a lot of energy.

155
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,360
This is what made nuclear physics possible.

156
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,620
Fission fusion, what that stating that stating that matter atoms.

157
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,440
When we take a look at atoms deep down, right, we have subatomic particles, protons, neutrons,

158
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,130
electrons, those electrons are zooming by moving pretty fast.

159
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,980
So it sort of insinuates that even though matter seems to be at rest for us, it's sort of actually

160
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,100
is in motion.

161
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:44,290
And that gives rise the movement of the subatomic particles to this internal energy, this rest energy.

162
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,840
OK, so should not be surprising that mass and energy are equivalent.

163
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:58,690
And what this is stating is that the total energy gamma and North C squared e is equal to a rest energy

164
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:05,410
energy that is inherent in the mass in the atoms, plus kinetic and the energy that is added by moving

165
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:12,010
that matter in a macroscopic kind of sense, but in a microscopic sense, looking at the subatomic particles,

166
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,840
there's a ton of energy in here.

167
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:14,240
OK?

168
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,830
As I was saying, this gave rise to nuclear power because what we do is we take the mass and we annihilate

169
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,720
a, we destroy it.

170
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,730
We convert that mass into what it really is.

171
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,210
We make use of the energy inherent in it, right?

172
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:34,140
We break apart those those particles and energy is released because in essence, it is energy.

173
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,320
It's rest energy, right?

174
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:43,480
So what this insinuates also is that one principle we take for granted in classical physics isn't quite

175
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:43,990
right.

176
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,750
On a macro, on a microscopic scale that is the idea of conservation of mass, right, because if mask,

177
00:12:51,750 --> 00:13:00,120
if really change between the mass and energy, you cannot stop flowing into a situation with a certain

178
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,030
amount of mass and flowing out with a different kind of mass, which means that what's happening conservation

179
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,450
of mass is not always true on a macroscopic level.

180
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,190
We know it gives us good results.

181
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,380
We see that in chemical engineering, you know, mass flow in equals mass flow out.

182
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,670
That tends to be right.

183
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:24,000
But we see when we go down to a very microscopic scale and I'll give you examples of this, that conservation

184
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,860
of mass no longer holds.

185
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,940
So this really throws a wrench into our conception of energy and also what we found with with momentum,

186
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
just mechanics in general, right?

187
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:44,960
This idea of special relativity, of redefining our space time, redefining our conception of how time

188
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:54,330
and space flows and is instantiate in the universe really creates a ripple effect that changes are conception

189
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,410
of energy, mechanical mechanics and everything we really know in regards to it.

190
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,740
So I hope you enjoyed that discussion.

191
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,010
We got this earth shattering energy squared kind of idea that is super super famous that I came up with.

192
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:14,070
Next, we're going to try and figure out how we can use this to do calculations at microscopic levels

193
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,980
and make use of these results.

194
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,150
Stay tuned.
