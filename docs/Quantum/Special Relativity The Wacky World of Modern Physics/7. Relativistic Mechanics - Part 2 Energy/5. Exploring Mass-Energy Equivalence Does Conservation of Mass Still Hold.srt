1
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,750
All right, now that we have a proper way for measuring this new form of energy was just discovered.

2
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,690
What I want to do is take a deeper, closer look at this ripple effect we've identified within the body

3
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,890
of theoretical physics.

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,220
OK.

5
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,890
In particular, what we're going to look at is the notion of mass energy equivalence, which we've sort

6
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,220
of talked about previously, right?

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,470
What do we talk about?

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,390
We found that mass is nothing more than a manifestation of energy.

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,460
That energy has a way of expressing itself in multiple different forms.

10
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,650
And when we talk about this from a classical sense, right, this should not be surprising, right?

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,640
Even from physics, one or one from the conception of physics.

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,560
We know that energy, whether it be potential energy, kinetic energy, he energy, chemical energy,

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,430
you name it.

14
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,370
We know that energy converts into different forms pretty freely, right?

15
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,790
That's a basic concept of physics in a particular.

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:20,350
We take kinetic energy when a body is moving as the most physically identifiable source of energy.

17
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,850
You can actually see it moving.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,800
You can see it being energetic.

19
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:31,540
But what we found in special relativity is that even when an object is at rest in virtue of being rest,

20
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,820
it still has energy inherent in it.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,170
Right?

22
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,420
That's what we call rest energy.

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,890
The energy that is built into its mass.

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,680
And in fact, what we found the last video is that the energy inherent in that mass is gigantic, especially

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,390
in the macroscopic world.

26
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:50,200
OK.

27
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:58,360
So if energy can be composed in mass and it can freely change into kinetic energy because energy can

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,830
express it in multiple different itself, it can express itself in multiple different ways.

29
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,720
What kind of implications does that have about conservation of mass?

30
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,040
Is this true?

31
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,360
Is it not valid?

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,460
Well, as I talked about previously, a few videos back, I asserted that conservation mass is not true

33
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,670
because of mass energy equivalence.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,780
So what we're going to do in this video is we're going to investigate that validity.

35
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,900
And this is going to give us an opportunity to run through some example problems.

36
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:37,540
You can build up your intuition with these weird ideas and start doing some special relativity calculations.

37
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:44,350
Now, when I assert that conservation of mass is not valid, that begs a lot of questions, right?

38
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,010
The first thing that comes to mind is the following If conservation of mass, which we tend to take

39
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,480
for granted and is pretty practical, we use it in a lot of practical applications.

40
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,600
If it's wrong, if it's not valid, well, why didn't we discover that in the first place?

41
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,250
Why has it taken so long to discover this?

42
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:10,180
And me myself personally, I worked in the chemical engineering industry, and I know that conservation

43
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,930
a mess is a basic principle that drives a lot of ideas.

44
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,090
It makes a lot of ideas and the production of chemicals, for example, possible.

45
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,460
So what's going on here?

46
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,040
Who's right?

47
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,010
Is relativity right in saying that it's not valid?

48
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:31,030
Or are we correct in looking at in a macroscopic scale and saying, Hey, conservation mask, it gives

49
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,700
us practical uses and it seems to be correct from our measurements.

50
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,890
What's going on here?

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,880
Who is right?

52
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,800
And furthermore, if it is incorrect, how can we have not measured this before, right?

53
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,450
Physics is an old discipline that goes back many, many years.

54
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,180
It's a very old idea.

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,010
How come this law has been prevalent for centuries?

56
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,180
Right?

57
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,980
Well, what's going on here?

58
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,560
So let's investigate this.

59
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:04,600
Let's look into this, and let's settle this once and for all.

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,610
So to investigate the validity of conservation matter of mass.

61
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:16,870
What we're going to do is we're going to consider a macroscopic situation with a microscopic situation.

62
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Sorry about that with a macroscopic analog so that we have a situation that we're used to looking at

63
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,840
in a macroscopic, ask a situation, you know, like a a mass ring system.

64
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:36,100
And we're gonna equate that to a situation of having atoms that are composed in a molecule now when

65
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,080
atoms are composed in a molecule.

66
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:38,950
Right?

67
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,310
Unstable atoms, which may be radioactive.

68
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,280
We may have radioactive isotopes, which what is going to happen is they may spontaneously fly apart

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,520
or they combine together to form a new molecule.

70
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,040
So for example, if we have a radioactive isotope, which may typically be depicted here with different

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,330
atoms of different colors.

72
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,690
We may find that sometimes some kind of event triggers the separation of these guys as they fly apart.

73
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,340
Now the question then becomes what happened to the mass?

74
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,030
All right.

75
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,900
If this guys are rest and they suddenly fly apart, we had to get that kinetic energy from somewhere.

76
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,870
Where did it come from?

77
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,920
And what are we going to find?

78
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:25,880
Is that with less energy inherent in the mass was actually converted into kinetic energy, which allowed

79
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,130
these guys to fly apart.

80
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:37,220
The Converse situation is sometimes we're going to have reflective or or attractive or repulsive forces

81
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:41,810
that you know, can form new molecules, right?

82
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,970
And that repulsive or attractive force is sort of equivalent to some kind of electrostatic force, which

83
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,690
we just talked about in a previous video.

84
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,510
And when you sort of talk about these forces, you talk about potential, right?

85
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:02,210
When you move these guys closer together, that builds up the potential and that route word should make

86
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:08,630
you think of potential energy so we can think about this situation and analyze it in a macroscopic scale.

87
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:17,840
Using a mass springs system to blast, we're going to blocks mass M1 and M2 if we take the top situation

88
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,110
and we compress that spring together.

89
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,280
And put some latch this blue last year so that they can't fly apart.

90
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,430
We know that this has endured energy in it.

91
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,120
Right.

92
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,910
The compression of that spring put potential energy into the system.

93
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,190
And when we have some kind of event such as kicking that latch off.

94
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,070
That potential energy is going to be released, it's going to be converted, the energy is going to

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,980
express itself now as kinetic energy, right?

96
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,620
You knock this guy off and I can press spring is going.

97
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,830
It's going to push these guys in opposite directions.

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,060
Get it that velocity.

99
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,500
He was at potential energy.

100
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,890
Conversely, when we look at the situation, when atoms come together and form a molecule, we can have

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:11,720
two flying together with kinetic energy compresses this spring and that kinetic energy gets transformed

102
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,690
into potential energy.

103
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,850
Right, right.

104
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,090
We study this many times before this is it's one to one principles.

105
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:29,280
So the question then becomes OK, if the kinetic energy is being compressed into potential energy.

106
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,230
My question for you is.

107
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,440
What is that potential energy when you compress that spring?

108
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,370
Is the spring becoming more massive?

109
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,560
Well, what we found from mass energy equivalence is that if the kinetic energy disappears, it has

110
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,250
to go somewhere.

111
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:52,020
And what I'm going to search and I'm going to use as analog here between the two situations, is it

112
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:59,020
that that spring as you compress it, as you put energy into it and your kinetic energy is converted?

113
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,030
What you're doing when you build up potential energy is you're building up rest.

114
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,370
Energy equals M.C. squared.

115
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,540
So energy increases to the mass mass also increase.

116
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,580
Another way of thinking about this is that as you compress that spring.

117
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,130
What happens is.

118
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:26,340
The different parts of the spring, the helix is build up gravitational mass, there's more gravitation

119
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,940
between them.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,250
And as a result of that, that builds up your potential energy until you release it.

121
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,430
Another way of thinking about this in a nice, tiny and kind of way is that as you compress it, the

122
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:44,790
space time is being curved or you're bending space time, which builds up gravitation.

123
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:53,490
OK, so the analogue between gravitation and gravitational mass implies that as the kinetic energy gets

124
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,320
converted into perpetual energy, you are in fact building up that mass.

125
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:04,770
OK, let's take a closer look at this by analyzing these two situations where we have a microscopic

126
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:10,350
scenario and a macroscopic scenario where we have a lot of intuition.

127
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,780
We're going to find is the intuition I just described, which should be, you know, that should be

128
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,890
something you take for granted.

129
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,380
This will guide us in understanding the weird relativistic effects on a microscopic scale.

130
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,250
OK, so to do that, what we're going to do, we're doing is conservation of energy.

131
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,810
We're going to directly show that the system is that is not conserved, right?

132
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,900
You know, the energy is going to be transformed.

133
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,770
Let's back up, either the mass is going to be transformed into kinetic energy or the kinetic energy

134
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,050
is going to be transformed into mass.

135
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:52,410
Sounds radical sounds insane because something you've never really dealt with, you can't really observe

136
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:52,560
it.

137
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,030
But you know what?

138
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,250
Looking at the situation, you understand this.

139
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,960
You understand the situation.

140
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,670
You've seen it many times before.

141
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,520
You can visualize it and you've studied this.

142
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:11,220
OK, so the situation we're going to take is this part here, the top portion here where we have combined

143
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,990
mass began.

144
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,370
We unleashed the latch.

145
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,840
There's some kind of mechanism.

146
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,080
It's radioactive isotope where the particles separate.

147
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,530
They don't ask the directions that builds up.

148
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,060
Energy is released now.

149
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,610
From a relativistic standpoint, what we say is that, OK, conservation of energy that must hold,

150
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,020
that's a basic physics principle.

151
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:38,760
So we say the energy in step one must equal the energy and say to, OK, let's fill in the details.

152
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,030
Let's see what we find.

153
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:50,080
So initially, we know we have mass big air, which is composed of M1 and M2, or so we think that's

154
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,880
what we say in the classical standpoint.

155
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,490
But we know we have a total mass arm of this hotel system.

156
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,670
We're calling it big m c squared, right?

157
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,450
It's at rest.

158
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:05,660
We know it has less energy now thanks to Einstein out and stick to what we know is that when it flies

159
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,390
apart, this velocity is going to give rise to kinetic energy.

160
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,980
So for System one and System two, system one, system two, we're going to have kinetic energy and

161
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,000
rest energy.

162
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,800
OK, so we have K1.

163
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,990
Kinetic energy was N1.

164
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,940
The massive system one ton c squared.

165
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,780
We have the same thing for System two, kinetic energy two plus the massive system two Times Square.

166
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:42,170
Now the question I want to ask you is when you look at this equation here, what can you say about NASA's?

167
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,110
What can you say about the massive?

168
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,630
Now, if K1 and K2 kinetic energy, right, that is usually expressed as.

169
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,910
Hey, is he got you one half and b squared?

170
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,170
Mass is not negative that that doesn't even make sense.

171
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,680
This guy is always positive.

172
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,870
So K1 was K2 is positive.

173
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,870
And this guy over here is being converted into what is on the right.

174
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:24,260
This implies inversion of K1 and K2 being positive that M1 and M2 cannot equal big M..

175
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:33,140
What I'm saying is that because of this, M1 plus M2 does not equal big M..

176
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,450
Contrary to what we usually see in classical mechanics, right?

177
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,850
So that that's sort of weird, right?

178
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:49,010
This implies that the initial mass m must be larger than the final mass M1 plus M2 because K1 was K2

179
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,000
is greater than zero.

180
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:50,810
Well.

181
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,050
How big is this difference, and can we measure this difference?

182
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,570
Because, you know, this is a big implication.

183
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,520
We should be able to observe that right?

184
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,140
This basically says what we see here and taking the tenants of special relativity that conservation

185
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,110
mass cannot hold cannot be valid, right?

186
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,370
We just proved it right here.

187
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,480
So some of the mass got converted into the kinetic energy here, and it expressed itself differently.

188
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,860
Strange idea.

189
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:23,690
Let's let's check along a bit more.

190
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:30,410
So if we click and want to see square enough to see squared and what what I'm over on the left side

191
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,330
here, what happens is.

192
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:42,560
The change in the math from the initial state to the final state or dealt a big M, which is M minus

193
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,420
the of mass and one percent to multiply that by C squared.

194
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,410
This gives us really K1 plus K2, which is the energy released as the bodies fly apart.

195
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,370
OK, so all we want to do.

196
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,190
We're going to work on next is we're going to run through a sample problem which takes this framework

197
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,500
we put together here using the intuition here and.

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,550
We throw in numbers, so what we want to find is if we put in all these different energy values, which

199
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,750
we just worked so diligently in figuring out how to measure with the electron volt.

200
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,190
How much mass was lost?

201
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,380
All right.

202
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,840
How much mass changed and.

203
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:36,920
Can we actually measure that difference if it's small, that might insinuate that conservation of mass

204
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,930
on a microscopic scale at a macroscopic scale is immeasurable.

205
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:49,970
And our notions of conservation of mass are still sort of valid in a certain sense, and we could still

206
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,920
utilize that and do practical things.

207
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,490
OK.

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,440
Stay tuned for that example.
