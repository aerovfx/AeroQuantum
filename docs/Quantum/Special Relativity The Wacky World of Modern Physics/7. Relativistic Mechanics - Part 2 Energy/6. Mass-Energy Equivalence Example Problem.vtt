1
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.290
All right, so what we're going to analyze for your first example and special relativity is the event

2
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:31.580
of taking a radioactive isotope and witnessing it spontaneously separate into two separate atoms.

3
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.160
Now the one we're focused on is Florian 232, which we have found in nature.

4
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.530
The following is true thorium 232 separates into radium 228 and helium four.

5
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.840
Now, if you're not familiar with this or you're taking chemistry so long ago, you're more of a physics

6
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.170
student.

7
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.780
I prefer physics.

8
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.510
You know, you can learn all chemistry in quantum mechanics, but that's another discussion.

9
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.440
You know, this is the mass numbers.

10
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.850
So this is like the total number of protons and neutrons in your nucleus.

11
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.730
And you know, you're going to have different values for different isotopes.

12
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.080
They're going to behave differently.

13
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.510
But when you look up the masses, which you'll have to do in special relativity, quite often you make

14
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.500
sure you get the correct isotope, the correct mass number right here.

15
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.870
OK, so the statement of the problem, the problem that we're going to look at for verifying everything

16
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.800
we just discussed and the strange idea is in mass energy equivalence.

17
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.550
Also, to take a look at the numbers with a combination of mass is as follows thorium 232, the radioactive

18
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.810
isotope as we just talked about, which spontaneously split into two separate parts.

19
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:47.120
If the combined kinetic energy of the offspring, the offspring are this guy and this guy is four mega

20
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.050
electron volts.

21
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.500
There's the energy unit we just discussed in the last video.

22
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.430
How much does the rest mass of the parent differ?

23
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.060
OK.

24
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.130
And what we're trying to figure out, ultimately, is how much the mass differs, how much mass got

25
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.820
converted into this kinetic energy that we measured right here.

26
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.640
And this is a measurable entity that we've measured multiple times in a lab, say.

27
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.960
And what we want to do is compare this to actual mass measurements.

28
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.160
Are the atoms now.

29
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.980
Fortunately, in the beginning of this lecture of this video, we ran through the calculation of basically

30
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.810
taking this and analyzing what happens to the energy use and conservation of energy.

31
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.690
So we already have a formula in terms of how much the rest, energy or the mass changes.

32
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.100
What we can do is just pull it straight out.

33
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.760
We found that they changed the mass when we go from here to here, which is the total mass M minus the

34
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.900
mass with the all spring.

35
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.260
This guy and this guy is no different than the some of the kinetic energies over C squared.

36
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.190
So all we need to do is we know what four mega electron volts is.

37
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.770
Plug this guy in and just fire by c squared and you probably think, Well, that's a job that's easy.

38
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.090
Yes, that's easy.

39
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.840
The mega electron, the electron bolt, that unit we spent all that time driving it because it makes

40
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.970
these calculations easy and straightforward, right?

41
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.350
If we had kilograms for mass, we would have to, you know, convert that into all these different units.

42
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.720
And it would it would just be a mess.

43
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.690
It's a nightmare, but you can see how nice and elegant the electron volt is.

44
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.620
Let's chug along and start analyzing conservation of mass using it.

45
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.860
So we plug it in for mega electron volts.

46
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.700
The power by C squared that again, as we talked about, is our new measurement of mass and special

47
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.360
relativity and Sara sort of scribble this guy off here.

48
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.980
What we want to do now.

49
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.410
He convert converted into a unit that we're more familiar with, the kilogram normally want to do this

50
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.960
in a special relativity calculation, but we want to compare the masses.

51
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.250
OK.

52
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.980
So in order to convert this well, we can do is we could take the electron volts mega NIS tenth of up

53
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.850
to the sixth.

54
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.730
We divide by the speed of light squared just three times 10 of eight meters per second squared.

55
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.440
And then we use the conversion factor we established in the last video, which was that there is one

56
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.970
point six percent to the minus 19 joules per one electron volts.

57
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.840
And again, we're trying to get kg mass units, right?

58
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.390
This is a unit of mass.

59
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.560
So we knew the relation between the Joule and the Newton meteorite, right?

60
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.500
One Newton Mir is one Joule one.

61
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.660
Newton is a kilogram transmitter per second squared or mass times acceleration.

62
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.970
That's this guy times another meter.

63
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.220
OK.

64
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.030
So when we take this guy and we cancel all the units, we're left with a kilogram.

65
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.360
And what we find, and this is the remarkable idea which really sheds light on why there is a lot of

66
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.650
confusion about conservation.

67
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.900
A mess is the following the change in mass from going from thorium to 32 or from here to its offspring.

68
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.360
Is a change in mass of seven times 10 to the minus 30 kilograms?

69
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.150
That's a very small measurement.

70
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.660
OK.

71
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:15.210
And this is why in a macroscopic scale, when we do measurements of mass and the change between two

72
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.060
different states, we don't measure a difference between the policy and the initial state because it's

73
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.280
so small that it goes unnoticed.

74
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.060
So yes.

75
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.610
Well, let's talk about previously, who's right, the chemical engineer or the physicist who's looking

76
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.660
at special relativity.

77
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.040
They are both right.

78
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.840
They're both right.

79
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.460
But one guys is concerned with situations where this may be measurable, and in fact, we can measure

80
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.080
this with very precise measurements.

81
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.930
The other guy is just concerned with using it for doing practical things, the chemical engineer he

82
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.710
wants to produce.

83
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.670
Maybe he wants to produce, I don't know hydrogen for being used in some other commercial area.

84
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:04.140
So, yes, conservation of mass will hold and a macroscopic scale, but at a microscopic scale.

85
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.960
When we start looking at the energy and hear it in the mass and the the the rest energy, it becomes

86
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.120
quite apparent and we can actually measure it.

87
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.300
So to really show how small this is, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the mass.

88
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.330
Are the parent the forum 232.

89
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:29.150
What you could do is you can look up masses in a standard textbook or online or just Google it.

90
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.450
Google has all the answers, right?

91
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:36.600
Sometimes we can take thorium 230 two and find that its mass in atomic mass units.

92
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.860
That's pretty standard in chemistry is to thirty two point zero three.

93
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.110
You now to convert that, there's a conversion factor.

94
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:52.650
We know that 1.6 six times 10 to the minus 27 kilograms is composed in one atomic mass unit, so we

95
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.260
can use that conversion and convert it over.

96
00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.440
And what we find is that it's like me seven times 10 to the minus 25 kilograms.

97
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.730
But what is important is that this is about one over 10 to the fifth.

98
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.450
This mass, or point zero zero one percent.

99
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:18.810
The size of the mass of foreign 232, so this difference is so small when compared to the parent that

100
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.010
it's not even a parent.

101
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.480
And that's why it was so difficult to really measure this guy.

102
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.750
I think this spells out the picture pretty clearly.

103
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:33.000
And that should make you feel much better between the fact that, yes, conservation of mass is not

104
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.660
quite right.

105
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.790
But the difference is so small, and the reason why is because eagles and c squared right?

106
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.890
C squared is frickin huge.

107
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.030
So the change in mass.

108
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.290
If you change just a little bit, that's a big change in energy.

109
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:53.100
And that's what's really driving this disparity between a smaller Delta M one compared over big.

110
00:07:53.100 --> 00:08:00.900
And so in essence, what I'm just doing here is I'm just saying Delta M over and above the this guy

111
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.910
of the parent, right?

112
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.730
This is no no difference than zero point zero zero one percent very, very small.

113
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.020
Or if we just write it out, clearly, it's one over a tenth, the fifth.

114
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.310
Very, very small.

115
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.120
Now.

116
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.500
Normally, we are not given the kinetic energy.

117
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:27.960
Right here that measured we're giving it in the province statement, and we would have to take the actual

118
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.660
mass of this guy, this guy and this guy, which are precise measurements and use that to figure out

119
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.740
how the energy changes or how we can calculate the the kinetic energy.

120
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.260
And then maybe that can be used to determine the momentum.

121
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.080
What we're going to find in subsequent videos is that momentum and energy are usually paired up.

122
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.880
But what I want you to get out of this video is.

123
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.030
Conservation of us, we can't use that in special relativity because it's not going to hold.

124
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.010
We're concerned about, you know, these units electron volts per square.

125
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.700
And if we just assume conservation of mass, which is not true, it's going to throw off all these guys

126
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.920
and we would calculate the wrong kinetic energy.

127
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:12.620
So what sort of through a calculation using tabulated values, a mask, the way in which we would usually

128
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.660
do it to calculate a kinetic energy and verify that this is indeed correct?

129
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:24.680
So as I was talking about previously, we can look up all the mass values of the parents and the offspring,

130
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.330
and I've tabulate those values right here for the particular isotopes.

131
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:34.520
Make sure you get the mass number correct when you look it up if you want to practice this.

132
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.790
You can look this up on Google.

133
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.850
Look it up in our book.

134
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.940
Maybe you have a textbook on this, but I tabulated this.

135
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.990
These guys and what we want to do is basically Delta Em write.

136
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.270
We write it out here the mass of the parent, minus the mass of the offspring.

137
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.590
That's the delta.

138
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.660
So if we add the offspring, this guy in the sky.

139
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.180
We get the following that's two thirty two point zero three four.

140
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.720
We see that even in the tarmac mash units, there's a difference between thorium and the products the

141
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.320
offspring.

142
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.350
It's a difference of point zero zero four.

143
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.720
Can you see that between these guys?

144
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:20.570
So if we take that difference here, point zero zero for you and we use that conversion I talked about

145
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.940
previously, we get about.

146
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.450
Seven times 10 to the minus 30 kilograms.

147
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.240
Which?

148
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.620
Agrees with our value right here, these guys are the same.

149
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:36.640
All right.

150
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.710
So this is how you would normally do the calculation and in special relativity, what you're going to

151
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:48.580
find is that usually you're going to have a lot of chemistry and physics ideas pairing up because we're

152
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.500
going to need to know the mass of the different atoms.

153
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.280
And we're working on a microscopic scale when we build energy.

154
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.350
But if you can compare the mass.

155
00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:02.680
Well, it's very easy to measure, much more more easy than, you know, the kinetic energy and so on

156
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.340
and so forth.

157
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.800
What we can measure, the mass have nice tabulate values, and you can figure out any kind of event

158
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.410
that takes place any kind of radioactive event.

159
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.560
Nuclear fission fusion.

160
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:21.680
Take the products and subtract the parents of the masses, and you can figure out how much energy was

161
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.130
released.

162
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:23.720
OK, so.

163
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:30.880
That's the video, I hope you got a lot of that, what we learned is that conservation of mass.

164
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:38.910
It's true in certain situations, loosely, but ultimately there is no conservation of mass.

165
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:46.830
Mass can freely move between being mass gravitational mass or being expressed as energy.

166
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.340
Right.

167
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:50.040
Mass energy equivalence.

168
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.630
And in future.

169
00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.190
Problems and lectures and courses.

170
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:58.690
What are you going to find is that?

171
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:05.030
We're going to have to pay attention, mostly to conservation and energy conservation of momentum.

172
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.530
And that's really going to drive our analysis in the future.

173
00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.130
All right.

174
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.380
Stay tuned for future lessons.
