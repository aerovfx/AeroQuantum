1
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.120
All right, so now we're going to dive a bit deeper into the implications surrounding this new relationship

2
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.560
that we just came up with, and that is as follows.

3
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.510
Again, it's e squared is equal to the rest of energy squared plus this new momentum energy p c squared.

4
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.160
Now, when you look at a quantity like this, the first thing that should pop up into your mind is,

5
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.490
well, it sort of looks like little battery in your own right.

6
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.720
So what would happen if we plotted it up on a right triangle?

7
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.390
Let's do that right now and see what implications that has.

8
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.490
So how that plotted up right here, we can see for the hypotenuse, we have the ITR here.

9
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.860
The bases are composed of the rest of energy and the movement of energy, which pop up right here.

10
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.040
And we know that the total energy is composed of the rest energy and that's the squared plus the kinetic

11
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.790
energy.

12
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.780
So what happens if we change the lines of these bases?

13
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.330
So let's say if we squash this together, so this side is much larger than the rest, the energy side.

14
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.070
When that happens, we find that the energy is mostly kinetic.

15
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.380
It doesn't have much rest energy and this base and that's squared is essentially zero.

16
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.380
So a key term, I want you to keep in the back of your mind.

17
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:36.230
Key idea is the fact that or I want you to ask this question, what would happen if a particle was accelerating

18
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.730
really fast at a high velocity?

19
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.410
So we had high momentum, high momentum energy, but it had barely any mass or no mass at all.

20
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.450
I know that sounds sort of weird having a mass particle.

21
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.830
Why in the world is that?

22
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.030
But what would happen that would insinuate that the energy is basically just pissy, right?

23
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.110
That's what this relationship is telling us.

24
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.660
So keep that in the back of your head.

25
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.370
Sounds very odd, very weird right now, but I will elaborate that actually elaborate on that actually

26
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.540
in a future.

27
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.540
VIDEO So we see that when the rest of energy is very low, the total energy is mostly composed of kinetic

28
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.390
energy and thoroughly, if we were to squash it in this direction so that P C is very small, we see

29
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.230
that the energy is mostly at rest energy and not c squared.

30
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.670
And that sort of makes sense because if your momentum is small, you don't have a lot of velocity,

31
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.830
you're not moving, you're at rest.

32
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.950
In essence, you have no no velocity, no kinetic energy.

33
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.560
So you have all of your energy.

34
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.270
OK, so we could play little games with this relationship and plot it up.

35
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.950
And geometrically, it tells us some interesting phenomena which we're going to revisit on this side

36
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.350
in a future VIDEO So keep that in the back of your head now.

37
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.590
Next thing I want to say and what I generally say about these ideas is that if we get a relativistic

38
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.540
equation or relationship or idea, we should be able to simplify it down to its classical equivalent

39
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.350
by taking a limit when we are not close to relativistic speeds, when V is much smaller than C, or

40
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.080
that implies that our momentum is very, very small, much smaller than one.

41
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.030
Let's see what happens here.

42
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.290
OK.

43
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.830
So when that happens, we could take our equation here e squared and we're going to square root on the

44
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.820
right side and we can sort of pull out some terms and see what's going to happen.

45
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.380
And we're going to make use of our binomial expansion shortly, but keep that in the back of your head.

46
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.490
So we see that we have c squared terms that are common.

47
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.030
So maybe we could factor out and not c squared squared.

48
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.940
So if we do that, we see that this guy pops up once at that position and then we want to get sort of

49
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.780
get rid of this guy.

50
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.530
So what we could do is if we convert this into p over and not C and square the terms we see when we

51
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.310
distribute this, the end that squared, we're going to cancel.

52
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.300
We get a seat of the fourth over here that's going to cancel C squared to get a C squared up here and

53
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.820
we end up with the original parameter.

54
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.440
So we factor out and then not c squared.

55
00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.930
We had a p over and not C, which sorta looks similar to this guy right here.

56
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.430
It's starting to take shape, it's starting to take form and this really is valid.

57
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.330
It should conform to this idea within this limit.

58
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.100
So let's chug along a bit more, OK?

59
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.670
So when we take this guy out, it's a term squared, energy squared.

60
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.620
We can perform at the square root on this term, pull it out to the rest of energy as follows, and

61
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.440
we get this term one plus quantity squared.

62
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.850
This looks very similar to this guy right here.

63
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.990
The quantity one plus x squared to the one half.

64
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.350
And we know that we can describe this through a series expansion.

65
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.590
We're going to expand out the polynomials and evaluate what effect if polynomial has upon the final

66
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.040
result.

67
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.320
What contribution does it provide?

68
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.560
And if we do that, we know that the binomial expansion gives us the following sum from K equals zero

69
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.790
to infinity of the entries K term where we have and it goes to one half and we have K in there and that

70
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.190
has to be multiplied by X to the two K.

71
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.080
So we expand out a few terms.

72
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.540
We get a one plus a one has.

73
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.990
X squared minus one x x, the four plus extraneous terms you don't worry about, because if we are a

74
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.890
small quantity here, we're going to say X is very small.

75
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.970
Rather, I guess, a more appropriate terms to say that this guys is very small, so I'm going to redefine

76
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.930
this a bit more, make it a bit more sensible and logical.

77
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.250
So this is going to be over and not see.

78
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.130
OK, so that guy, obviously, that's going to be much less than one, because C is very large and usually

79
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:54.430
we have very large masses in the macroscopic world.

80
00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.910
So in essence, we're trying to say is that we're trying to make X small because when X is small, this

81
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.720
guy converges.

82
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.680
X is less one.

83
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:09.820
And if it's law, if you take a small turn squared that small, a small turn to fourth.

84
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.070
That's significantly smaller than this term.

85
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.750
So this is going to be negligent.

86
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.540
It's going to add basically nothing to the final solution.

87
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.550
And we can approximate this term as approximately one plus one half times x squared.

88
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.050
So that's the name of the game.

89
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.280
This guy is the same here where X is equal to p over and not C.

90
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.190
OK.

91
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.370
So we take this guy.

92
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.820
And we use this definition here.

93
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.640
We get one for this whole term here.

94
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.940
One plus one half times over and let's see quantity squared.

95
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.800
We would get this term here, but it's going to cancel out because compared to these leading terms,

96
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:57.100
and I just explained, it's significantly smaller, right in that bracket, right there.

97
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.450
And when we do that?

98
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.470
We get a very interesting turn.

99
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.790
First of all, this guy factors out here, we get our energy.

100
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:08.350
That's not surprising.

101
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.150
But here and I'm going to write something right here really fast.

102
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:23.510
OK, here are the second term, what we end up with is the fact that this through is not c squared divided

103
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:24.950
by the square C squared.

104
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.360
Well, C squares cancel out, but we get an end, not on the bottom.

105
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:35.750
So the net effect is we get P-Square over two times and not on the bottom here.

106
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.280
And lo and behold, what happens is.

107
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:49.420
We see this term popping up right here in this same exact limit, and that increases our confidence

108
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.930
in this relationship and helps to sort of illustrate the fact that, yes, this is a more inclusive

109
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.470
result.

110
00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:03.520
This guy right here, it's more inclusive result that includes this result and results at relativistic

111
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.180
speeds.

112
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.480
And you know, all these relativistic effects crop up.

113
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.440
So this is the absolute term, the relationship we got.

114
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:17.470
What do we accomplish in this video and this video by simply working through some mathematics, massaging

115
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.220
some equations?

116
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:25.360
We are able really to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions or perspectives on the universe,

117
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.580
such that we got this nice universal conception of everything that's transpiring right in front of our

118
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:30.920
eyes.

119
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:31.270
All right.

120
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:38.290
So this relationship in the next video, I'm going to show you how it's so powerful from an analytical

121
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:39.130
perspective.

122
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:45.340
And we're going to see how this can help us switch quickly between energy and momentum and also get

123
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.910
this nice absolute representation of the universe.

124
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.290
Hope you enjoyed the video.

125
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.910
Stay tuned for the next one.
