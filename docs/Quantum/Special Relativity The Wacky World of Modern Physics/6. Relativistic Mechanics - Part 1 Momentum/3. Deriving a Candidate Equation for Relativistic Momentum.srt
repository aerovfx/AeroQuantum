1
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,960
Now what we've just discovered, namely that the conservation of momentum does not hold up at high velocities.

2
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,130
It's quite disturbing because if that is true and if conservation of momentum is not actually a conservation

3
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,900
law that has huge, huge implications upon Newtonian mechanics and energy and everything we really take

4
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,230
for granted in physics that we learn if it's one right.

5
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,090
We don't want that to happen.

6
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,800
The implications are too huge.

7
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:53,760
So rather than taking momentum and discarding in the trash can, what we're going to do is we're going

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,900
to bring that back, examined a bit further and try to modify it a bit to make it work with special

9
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,380
relativity and our original conceptions of conservation of momentum.

10
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,280
OK.

11
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,200
This should not be a very surprising idea to take right because we've done this many times already in

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,400
this course, and I study a special relativity right when we found that our notions of time and space

13
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,610
didn't really hold up at high velocities, what we did is we preserve what they were but modified them.

14
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,920
They massage them a bit to work with.

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,780
The additional theory is a high velocities.

16
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,690
So if we do the same thing here to try and save momentum, we're not really stepping outside of the

17
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,090
bounds of what we normally do.

18
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,060
We've done this already.

19
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,140
We're familiar with it.

20
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,140
Let's apply it to momentum, OK?

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,380
And in order to help us do this, what we're going to do is take everything we've learned with special

22
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,470
relativity so far, which I have summarized here and I'm going to walk through.

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,800
We're going to use this as a guide as to how we're going to modify momentum and make it work with conservation

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:05,400
and then momentum once again, just because that's a super, super important theoretical idea.

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,020
OK, we don't want to throw it away.

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,030
We don't want to discard.

27
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:14,700
So what we learn is special relativity so far compared to classical physics is the form.

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,020
If we have a velocity and we travel close to the speed of light, as we see here in this graph, which

29
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:28,590
plots up the relative velocity with respect to the time span accelerating, we know that classically,

30
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,080
if you accelerate something we know V is equal to a Delta T, right?

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,430
That's the linear equation.

32
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,810
We get a straight line.

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,870
But what special relativity does is implement the second postulate special relativity, which states

34
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,840
that what is it you should be telling me now?

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,290
I've mentioned it so many times before.

36
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,040
It states that you cannot travel faster than the speed of light, and it tries to enforce that parameter.

37
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,540
And as a result of enforcing this, we get all these weird effects.

38
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,890
So we see that we have this cap on velocity where the relativistic result.

39
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,780
It gets capped out ambient Eq. one or velocity equal to C.

40
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,250
And this weird effect gives rise or this idea because rised weird effects, namely length, contraction

41
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:14,590
and time.

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:21,510
What are we find with these guys if we plot up our time in a rest frame, roll up to a proper time in

43
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,410
a moving frame?

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,460
We know that that plotted against the relative velocity.

45
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,230
Classically, we would say that over time it just is.

46
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,470
It's an absolute quantity, but we know that time is relative.

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,660
It's contingent upon our reference frame that is actually viewing it so real.

48
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:46,830
Basically, we find that as we travel to high velocities, this effect of capping the velocity modifies

49
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,690
our conception of space time and the time the rest frame shoots up.

50
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,180
This ratio here shoots up to make sure that we do not exceed all the last you've ever seen.

51
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,330
OK.

52
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:09,210
It doesn't matter how, how, how much you force that obstacle, faster time is going to differentiate

53
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,620
between these two reference frames.

54
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,380
It's just a relativistic effect that's time dilation.

55
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,610
Similarly, if we took a meter stick and measured the length contraction, the length of it classically

56
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,070
would say a meter stick is a meter stick.

57
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,430
That's one meter, no matter what.

58
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,050
You can look at it however you want.

59
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,280
That's not going to change its length.

60
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,100
But because of this, we're cap on velocity.

61
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,700
What we found is that as you travel close to the speed of light, the length tends to shrink it contracts.

62
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,440
It contracts that moving meter stick contracts to somebody at rest.

63
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,970
So eventually it looks like it has no length, which is a weird idea.

64
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,750
But that's where relativity tells us right.

65
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,230
We're trying to force this cap, so we find two important things.

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:58,620
These effects give rise due to enforcing the second part of the special relativity escape velocity,

67
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,310
and also they tend to occur at a high velocity.

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,000
So using these two ideas, these two principles.

69
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:14,270
What we find is that we could take momentum and we could preserve what we originally defined as us as

70
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,920
envy.

71
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,740
But I mean, we can multiply it by some factor that's dependent upon the velocity that kicks in the

72
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,540
play and high velocity.

73
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,260
So we get relativistic effects modifying our momentum.

74
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,450
But at low velocities, it gets kicked out of the scene and we converge upon the classical result,

75
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,230
namely that P is equal to envy.

76
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,080
Sorry about that.

77
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,030
So what we're going to do?

78
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,780
We're going to come up with a new candidate momentum as such, and we're going to try to use this idea.

79
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:54,250
To really push forward a modified version of momentum that saves the day and retains conservation,

80
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,160
the momentum that conservation law is super, super important.

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,990
We don't want to discard that out of whack.

82
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,240
So what are we going to do?

83
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,880
What we're going to do is we're going to say, OK, let's take a look at time, relation a bit more

84
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,950
and see what we can get out of it.

85
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:18,570
What we found is that in time dilation reference frames that are not going as fast as the moving body,

86
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,880
they're going to see that time dilates, but they agree on one thing what is that namely the proper

87
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,570
time, right?

88
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,940
What do we find time dilation as described by TENIAN in any reference frames equal to gamma times the

89
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,640
proper time, the time measured by the moving body?

90
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,850
OK.

91
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:42,720
And what everybody agrees on, they agree that in that reference frame, you're going to have a proper

92
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,710
time to not.

93
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,680
It doesn't matter how the time is experienced in your reference frame or any other reference frame.

94
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,690
Everybody would agree that in the proper time, it's going to be defined as not.

95
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:02,100
So maybe if we're trying to get this universal conception of moment on using this new candidate, we

96
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,020
can focus on calculating the momentum with respect to the moving body.

97
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,390
That way, everybody would agree upon that quantity.

98
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,900
And maybe it would be conserved any time after which we measure it.

99
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,440
Right?

100
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,880
So that's the name of the game.

101
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:25,080
What we're going to do is going to redefine momentum as such, and we're going to focus on the proper

102
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,390
time round three, the moving reference frame and try to get this form that pop out.

103
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,980
Now if we do that, the way in which we are defining momentum is as follows.

104
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,900
So the momentum p, which again is still a vector, is defined as end times velocity, which is R the

105
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,540
T not.

106
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,970
This is this new definition because we're going to focus on the moving reference frame this teenage

107
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,810
guy right here.

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,350
OK.

109
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:56,670
So when we do that, we know that, you know, r the position vector is determined by four variables

110
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,700
we have X, Y and Z, and it's also a function of time because as can be a function of time, Y can

111
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,090
be a function.

112
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,590
Time Z can be a function of time.

113
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,420
But we also know that from time dilation this time T, which are dependent upon is defined as gamma

114
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,100
times, not the proper time.

115
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,180
So if the quantity are that we're trying to differentiate in terms of does not have a not in it.

116
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,620
If you know this guy is really this should really be like sub T y city.

117
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,160
The city.

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,380
Right.

119
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,520
That brought a little odd.

120
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,240
What we know is that we have to differentiate first in terms of tea.

121
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,730
And then we take the turn of tea.

122
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,900
You expect the tea not.

123
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,310
And we get the exact value that we're trying to calculate this guy right here.

124
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:54,690
So another way of writing this, which it's very sloppy, but what this really should be looking like

125
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,730
is x tea.

126
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:05,690
Not if we want that the chain effect to really shine right here in the mathematics.

127
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:13,550
So what we find is that in order to make this calculation that everybody would agree upon and the moving

128
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,280
reference frame, we'd have to do the following we take the derivative ah, with respect to basically

129
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,070
first, this tea party in that particular reference frame, which you know, everybody would disagree

130
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,370
about what TRT the velocity they observe, right?

131
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,360
Because that's that's the name of the game is special relativity or relativity in general.

132
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:33,890
So we would get this guy.

133
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,020
Well, if you differentiate, respect the tea, that's a function of tin, also of tea, not changes.

134
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,720
Tea is going to change, so you need to account for that fact, right?

135
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,760
She wrote Capital One B.

136
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,410
So you have to multiply by the tea.

137
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,500
Not this extra term that pops up.

138
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:55,790
And the way which I like to think about this bothers you is we're taking this guy, but you could sort

139
00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,720
of like to cancel those guys out and you retain that DADT.

140
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,870
Not a sort of what's happening here.

141
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,610
That's the way I like to think about it in my mind.

142
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,350
That's how I did cop one, Juan.

143
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,420
You can use that if you want to do a little trick.

144
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:14,720
So as a result of doing this, well, we could do we could say, Oh, it's not, oh, we can take this

145
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,650
guy here before I see this guy with respect to the proper time.

146
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,510
Oh, look at that.

147
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,750
A gamma pops out that gamma pops out.

148
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:30,800
So when this happens, what we get is the following candidate for relativistic momentum.

149
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:36,980
And we see if we compare this back to here what we postulated based upon these effects here and this

150
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,640
is the name of the game.

151
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,870
This is what's really driving a change in relativistic momentum.

152
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:52,120
What we find is that this guy is no different than the gamma factor gamma sub V, where a catastrophe

153
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,460
is defined as one over the square root one minus the magnitude v overseas squared.

154
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:05,420
Now it's important to note that this guy here is the velocity of the object.

155
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,100
If the object moving, not necessarily your reference rate, right, because you can have a reference

156
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,840
frame that's moving at a different velocity.

157
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,490
Well, what we did here is we got the velocity of the moving object.

158
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,700
That's a big change compared to other ideas.

159
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:26,720
So in the future, I may put a gamma so b to signify this fact, but keep it in the back of your mind

160
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,030
when you do relativistic momentum calculations.

161
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:36,020
You have to use a gamma that is defined in terms of a policy of the object that is moving.

162
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,860
So we have a candidate idea right here.

163
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,160
Candidate trial for relativistic momentum.

164
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:50,570
If this was true, then if we can serve this quantity in both Phillips reference frame and terrorists

165
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:56,780
reference frame, as we discovered in the experiment they're putting together, this should be conserved.

166
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,400
Basically, we want to take this guy thrown into that equation that we we drive for momentum, conservation

167
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,780
of momentum, and we want to show that conservation momentum holds for this guy.

168
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,620
If this really is the correct form, it should halt.

169
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,260
OK, so what we're going to do is we're going to do that.

170
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,420
We're going to run through that to give you some experience working with this weird quantity here.

171
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,940
And then if it is true, if that is the true candidate, we will take a step back and be like, Whoa,

172
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,710
whoa, this is a weird -- equation.

173
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,390
What am I going to do?

174
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:29,780
What am I?

175
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,550
How do I interpret this?

176
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,010
What does this actually mean?

177
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,710
Because there are a lot of different interpretations of this, and I'm going to walk you guys through

178
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:39,980
that.

179
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:46,550
But first, let's try and run through that experiment with this new candidate momentum.
