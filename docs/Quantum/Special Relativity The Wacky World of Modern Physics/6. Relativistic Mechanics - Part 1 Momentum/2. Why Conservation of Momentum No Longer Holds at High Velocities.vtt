1
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.650
All right, so now that we have some more board space, what we're going to do and we're going to literally

2
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.460
throw this into the equation, we have a conservation of momentum and see if it yields the the the trees

3
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.080
or see if it is in fact true and if it's preserved in a special relativity.

4
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.630
So we know that pinochle

5
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.250
must equal final.

6
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.000
And these are vectors, so that gives rise to an X component and Y component.

7
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.800
We're going to consider the X component or the Y component for us because that's what's really interesting.

8
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.940
And we know that the mass of each object is empty, so we end up with four state one.

9
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.860
Before we get the.

10
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.530
Why?

11
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:21.750
And vie for fill up state, one plus m d y parents at the state, one that must be equal to the final

12
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.110
state.

13
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:35.100
So this must be equal to M UI, fill up the two plus and the Y parents state to.

14
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.910
And you could see it gets quite messy and a lot of textbooks actually skip this part.

15
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.490
But I want you guys to see that it does not work.

16
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.610
I want you to build that intuition firsthand.

17
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.850
So I'm going to sort of arrange these guys to make it a bit nicer.

18
00:01:49.880 --> 00:02:01.250
I'm going to pull all these guys over here so we can zero over here and we end up with m p y p two minus

19
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:15.080
m d y p one plus m d y t two minus m v y t one.

20
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.570
OK, I'm going to redefine these guys and see this this right here.

21
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.400
Is the change in momentum?

22
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.840
For Philip and this guy right here is the change in momentum for Terrence.

23
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.450
It's a little bit more manageable to work with, so we're going to calculate both of these separately

24
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.380
and in order for conservation will.

25
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.280
That's not to be true.

26
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.540
They must be equal and opposite in sight.

27
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.920
OK, let's see.

28
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.840
Same if you have an opposite sign.

29
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.680
OK, let's work first with Philip.

30
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.150
That seems pretty easy.

31
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.830
Delta P.

32
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.020
That's no more than what we have right here.

33
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.580
That's an V.

34
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.520
Y up to minus m v y.

35
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.590
Up one.

36
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.130
OK.

37
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.360
So we can come down here.

38
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.860
We know that's too right.

39
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.820
I mean, that's one.

40
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.860
This is too.

41
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.890
So we plug this guy in, we get em VIP too.

42
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.000
That's negative, you know?

43
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.630
So you get a negative here minus M so VIP one, we got that.

44
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.910
All right.

45
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.350
You have the positive, you not.

46
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.930
He's throwing it in the positive direction.

47
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.490
This becomes that.

48
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.940
And we end up with is the negative two and you not?

49
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.560
So this is the defining moment, really, in order for conservation of matter to be true.

50
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.330
And we want that to be the case.

51
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:07.530
When we calculate Delta intent for targets is ball that must be equal to positive to immunize such that

52
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.770
when you are in the weather, you get zero, there is no change of momentum.

53
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:21.930
Let's see what happens as we have defined here, Delta P Matanzas Ball is in the Y parents to minus

54
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.570
M the UI parents one.

55
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.900
And we end up with something that does not look like it's going to match up.

56
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.960
What's going on here?

57
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.700
Let's plug these guys in.

58
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.210
OK, so what we end up with is an annuity to where is that this guy right here?

59
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.290
We get em.

60
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.560
You not divide by the square root of one minus the relative.

61
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.700
R C squared minus.

62
00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:02.230
And this guy, we get a negative in the negative you not so this becomes positive.

63
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.080
Planted by this guy.

64
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.210
A lot of math there with me.

65
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.250
Will we end up with is something that's similar, but it's different.

66
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.450
We see some ganas popping up right here in this camera here.

67
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.710
So it sort of feels like relativistic effects that ripple effect is showing its face in the mathematics,

68
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.340
right?

69
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:41.110
So this becomes no more than just two am you, not one over one minus virome over C squared.

70
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.890
And what we find is very interesting.

71
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.230
And this is something that's going to smack that smile for Phillip's face when he sees that, oh my

72
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.950
god, conservation of momentum no longer applies when the world broke.

73
00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.640
What do I do?

74
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.800
So if we take these guys and put it in here?

75
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.890
This becomes no more than two, am you not?

76
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.800
OK, so we get people.

77
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.670
That's going to be a negative one, plus this guy.

78
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.420
So we get.

79
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.510
One over square root of one sprawl over sea.

80
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.450
Squared.

81
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.880
Minus one.

82
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.550
Now, what's interesting is that.

83
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:39.820
In a classical sense, if the relative is much smaller, let's see if we're not going super fast.

84
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.720
This becomes zero, the viral oversee the relative velocity.

85
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.120
This becomes one and it holds.

86
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:54.490
But as soon as that guy starts picking up, we see that conservation of momentum no longer holds, at

87
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.600
least in the y direction.

88
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.020
So that is troubling because that's going to have huge implications throughout basically every facet

89
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:09.520
of physics that we've put together every classical idea, such as forces, energy, so on and so forth.

90
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.140
So that's pretty interesting.

91
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:20.260
So we find that in a wider action is not conserved, but in the X direction, we could do the same exact

92
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:26.380
exercise, but with an X here and said, you know, we could just work through that mentally.

93
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.100
So basically, we have em, V.X.

94
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.800
So the X is zero for Philip.

95
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.730
So basically, you basically get zero zero metal to begin with in the extraction.

96
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.920
You have zero momentum to end with four fill up.

97
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:50.220
And in Terence's case, with his ball right, we just have relative so.

98
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:59.670
Whereas v2, OK, so V.X, to be relative, it's the same, so the final minus the initial, nothing

99
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.300
changed.

100
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:00.930
OK.

101
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:06.870
So in the X direction, it is conserved, but in the Y direction it is not.

102
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.250
It's not conserved.

103
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.600
That's interesting.

104
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.320
OK.

105
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:17.910
So in order to save Newton's second law, our conceptions of force are conceptions of energy.

106
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:26.100
What we're going to need to do is figure out how we can modify this and save the day, how we can rectify

107
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:31.850
classical physics to work with modern physics, special relativity, so on and so forth.

108
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.730
And that is what we're going to tackle in the next video.

109
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.250
What we're going to do is I'm going to show you.

110
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:47.900
How relativistic effects arise and use that to try and really come up with a new candidate for defying

111
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:55.670
momentum and rectifying this big problem such that fill up, you can get a smile back on his face.
