1
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,730
All right, so we finally confirmed that there is indeed a ripple effect that's going on with momentum

2
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,240
that changes our conception of momentum at high velocities.

3
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:35,140
Now what we want to do is we want to take a look at that ripple and identify the implications, understand

4
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,820
what in the world is going on here.

5
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,470
Because when you look at this are real relativistic momentum.

6
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,320
You look at this here like, Whoa, what in the world is going on?

7
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:49,810
We have this gamma, which is a function of the velocity times, our original conception of momentum.

8
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:56,050
OK, what's cool is that we know that this guy Lorentz factor was the upon the relative velocity.

9
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,640
If it moves out of lusty, that's much less than the speed of light, see?

10
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,940
And this simplifies down to our classical result, which is good.

11
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,150
It converges upon what we see in reality.

12
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,610
Well, what in the world is this imply at high velocities?

13
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:18,040
Now this is a contentious topic that a lot of physicists actually argue about do not agree fully upon

14
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,930
in this day and age.

15
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,970
And in fact, Einstein.

16
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,800
When he discovered this, he made an error himself in taking a look at this.

17
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,260
At first, he described something that is known as a variable mass, which sounds weird.

18
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,580
I know I'll get to that shortly.

19
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:40,480
But eventually he came around saying that he greatly regrets introducing that concept and backtracked

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,570
behind back to his original idea that we want to use what is known as a rest mass.

21
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:46,930
What?

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,710
When, where am I talking about here?

23
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,980
I'll get to that in a second.

24
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:56,110
Let's look at the charts here because what I like to say is that this should be driven by the observations

25
00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:02,020
you have in front of you, the information, the data, and that should drive the concepts that are,

26
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,870
I guess, extract it out of your observations.

27
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:12,010
If you diverge from that paradigm, you run into problems because you try to force ideas to crop up

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,920
outside of the universe outside of your experience.

29
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,000
And that leads the problem.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,830
So let's focus on the physics.

31
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,280
Let's focus on the regular implications that they actually have.

32
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,460
What I have drawn up here to match what we looked at previously for time dilation, length, contraction

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:34,000
and what we see with the cap on velocity as I've plotted up this relativistic velocity relativistic

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,510
momentum.

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,380
Sorry for that.

36
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,980
So this guy is plotted in terms of our relativistic velocity, and we see that classically, you know,

37
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,840
this is a linear function momentum.

38
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,060
This is a linear function.

39
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,280
What is happening is at high velocities, we see the momentum spikes up, and that's because we can

40
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,390
never get this guy.

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,420
That's an effect on the cap of velocity.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,980
But if this guy spikes up what is causing that spike, right, we know that here we see that the velocity

43
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,450
isn't increasing much.

44
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,970
Right, it's harder to increase that velocity.

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,010
Well, what exactly is going on?

46
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,870
So physicists postulate that there was actually a variable mass that as you travel faster, your mass

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,060
gets larger, which is implied by here.

48
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,350
They could redefined this gamma and not the mass.

49
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,260
We would conceive an object as if it was at rest and was studying on a scale.

50
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,970
They redefined that as a new variable called the variable mass, and that allows us to sort of reflect

51
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,110
the original form we have.

52
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,440
We would have basically an end the M.V., the variable mass times, the V, and that looks just like

53
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,990
our regular momentum equation, but that has some problems with it.

54
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,490
But let's let's let's take a look at that.

55
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,700
So what it's saying is that instead of actually increasing velocity when you try to push an object closer

56
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,910
to the speed of light, what it's asserting is that relativistic effects come into play and build up

57
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,920
that that mass.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,830
So it looks massive and looks heavier, and that extra exertion is being dumped into the object's mass,

59
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,740
which makes the momentum sky rocket.

60
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,170
Now, that's problematic for many reasons.

61
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,840
The first of which is if you redefine your mass, which is a basic constituent used in a lot of physics

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,370
equations, what if you take the variable mass and you throw that into the equation for gravity?

63
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,660
What's going to happen then you're a gravitational force is going to change a lot of students get confused,

64
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,120
they start throwing around this idea in different equations where it does not belong and they run into

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,810
problems.

66
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,920
So what actually, I like to conceive of and a lot of physicist at higher levels like to use, they'd

67
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,960
like to avoid this variable math problem.

68
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,420
And what we say is that our conception of math is a little misguided.

69
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,370
We must understand what we mean by math.

70
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,830
So math has multiple properties.

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,180
We use math really to convey gravity, basically somebodies weight.

72
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:05,750
The more massive you are, the fatter you are, the heavier you are.

73
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,720
Your gravitational force is larger, in essence.

74
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,610
But at the same time, we use math to describe inertia, the resistance to change in motion, right?

75
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,430
So we have, let's say, a tractor trailer that's going really fast.

76
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,620
It's very massive.

77
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,820
It has a lot of mass in it.

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:31,640
It's going to take a larger force to stop that than a little toy car, maybe about one 1000, the mass

79
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,460
of that guy.

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,870
And that's because mass has inertia, right?

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,460
If something is moving really fast, a lot of mass, it wants to continue to move really fast with a

82
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,120
lot of mass.

83
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,340
Conversely, if something doesn't have a lot of mass, it's easy to stop it when it's moving right.

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:52,310
This is our notion of inertia, and it sort of comes into play with our conception of gravity associated

85
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,180
with mass.

86
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:53,990
OK.

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:01,190
But what I'm going to say is that the physics here says that if you're trying to speed up, you're trying

88
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,840
to speed up close to the speed of light.

89
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,860
Further, that extra effort has resistance.

90
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,130
There's resistance, there's an additional inertia.

91
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,320
So you want to think about this as as you start pushing that object further, you're building up that

92
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,670
inertial inertial resistance to speeding up further.

93
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,830
So when you build up that inertia, this is what skyrockets the momentum.

94
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,290
And Lisa, this guy here.

95
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,230
But the interesting thing is that when you apply your relativistic momentum.

96
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,860
Related to your classical result, we find that they match up and let me backtrack bit when you plot

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,770
momentum with respect to the time spent accelerating.

98
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,170
We see the full picture here.

99
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,670
This tells the full story.

100
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,840
We know that.

101
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,260
The velocity isn't going to increase much as you push it further close to the speed of light, but the

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,040
momentum.

103
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:04,050
It stays consistent with our classical result because the object appears to get heavier, it gets more

104
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:08,910
inertia, more resistance to speeding up.

105
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,210
So you can continue to try to accelerate, try to force that guy.

106
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,950
And that resistance is good and that is the relativistic effect.

107
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,420
That is the key.

108
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,870
That is the idea which allows us to express the second of special relativity again.

109
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,990
Same idea time relation length contraction.

110
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,710
We get weird effects that try to enforce this cap on velocity, and that's cropping up again in momentum.

111
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:42,330
So what we like to say is that physicists at higher levels generally ignore this variable mask idea.

112
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:49,170
It's sort of it leads to the correct conception, but it can lead to a lot of theoretical and mathematical

113
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,800
fallacies.

114
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,630
We're going to avoid that in this class.

115
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:59,760
We're going to say that you know what, an object has a rest mass and not that is measured at measured

116
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,390
at rest.

117
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,460
So you take that object.

118
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,840
May you stop moving.

119
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,640
Put it on a scale.

120
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,570
That's mass.

121
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,080
That's the mass it's going to retain in history, as well as our intuition.

122
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,160
Because if an object moves really fast, that doesn't change its its weight, it doesn't affect its

123
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,910
gravity, right?

124
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,650
We want that to be consistent.

125
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,340
What is happening when it moves fast is inertia builds up, so it's harder to move that guy further

126
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:26,670
along.

127
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,000
Right?

128
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,670
That's spelled out right here in LA Plot's.

129
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,210
If we want to get closer to the speed of light, it's going to be harder to push.

130
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,320
It's going to be harder to get more velocity.

131
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,790
And that's because we're getting more inertia that building that guy up.

132
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:49,170
As a result, it allows the relativistic effect to be equivalent to the classical definition of momentum.

133
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,520
And there you have it, that is relativistic momentum.

134
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,690
It's a weird idea.

135
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,880
It's an idea that's usually very confused in a lot of textbooks.

136
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,830
You're going to see this variable mass mentioned.

137
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,250
Some books, especially introductory books, are going to get started as a fact.

138
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,370
But what you want to think about is your conception of mass.

139
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:18,090
How can we sort of like a gravitational idea and an inertial idea and you want to think about as you

140
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,240
go?

141
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,850
Of course, the speed of light resistance builds up.

142
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:29,350
To trying to resist that extra velocity to enforce this cap on velocity so you don't get faster than

143
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,130
the speed of light.

144
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,860
And as a result, the momentum blows up.

145
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,220
You get this guy here that's identical to the classical result.

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,380
And what is important about this is it implies that if this is true, what we can do is and what we'll

147
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:55,610
do in the next few videos is we can say, Oh, well, that was just DDT, right?

148
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,510
We could save that guy.

149
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:04,250
Our classic definition knew and second law and we can charge ahead, use the same idea as me, modify

150
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,790
them a bit.

151
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,710
But we know that they still hold.

152
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,870
We know that conservation will make them holds.

153
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,390
We are seeing the conservation of energy holds could be a little weird, but we're going to see that

154
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:23,930
this idea here is sort of reminiscent of an idea that mass is are similar to an equivalent to energy.

155
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,100
Weird idea.

156
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,270
That's going to sound very weird.

157
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,730
We're going to derivable that in the next few videos.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,810
Stay tuned.

159
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,280
I hope you enjoyed that.

160
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,970
I hope you got the proper definition of an item out of that.

161
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,700
And I hope you really understood what I was trying to convey here, because this is a very this is a

162
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,940
very precise point, a nuanced point.

163
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,210
And it's important for you to understand that really there's a resistance to speeding up and that changes

164
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,740
our conception of momentum.

165
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,320
But in essence, when we modify it a bit, our conservation laws still apply.

166
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,770
OK.

167
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,000
Stay tuned.
