1
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:18,850
All right.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,610
So far in our journey to force this nice universal conception of the universe, we ended up completely

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:30,100
redefining our basic notions of kinematics and spacetime in particular.

4
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,900
What we found is that the poshest the special relativity, which really gave birth to these weird,

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:40,930
wacky effects such as time dilation and length contraction, challenged our notion of the universe as

6
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,440
a whole.

7
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:49,240
But in doing so, it really allowed us to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions and

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,960
allowed us to form this map, known as the Lorenz transformation, which really allowed us to talk intelligently

9
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,760
about a infinite set of perceptions of the universe.

10
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:08,080
Now, with these monumental ideas being introduced in special relativity, it's natural to assume that

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:14,830
they would have a cascading effect upon physical theories that are closely related to the ideas that

12
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,000
are imbued within them.

13
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:25,390
For example, maybe ideas that depend upon velocity, space and time would also give rise to special

14
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,770
relativistic effects.

15
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,440
And that's what we're going to find in this video.

16
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,070
OK.

17
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:39,220
In fact, much like throwing a rock into a still peaceful lake in nature, we're going to find that

18
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,180
taking these huge ideas, these impactful ideas and throwing them into the body of physics is going

19
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:53,770
to lead to a ripple effect that drastic effects a lot of different physical theories such as momentum,

20
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,260
energy, so on and so forth.

21
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,750
Furthermore, what we're going to find is that much like when you throw a rock into a pond and that

22
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,900
creates the ripples that expand out from the source of that effect, the rock hitting the water, we're

23
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:14,320
going to find that when we introduced this idea into a body of physics, physical theories which are

24
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,550
closely tied to space-time kinematics, so on and so forth are going to be drastically affected.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,590
It's going to be very impactful theoretical implications associated with them.

26
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,070
But once we start getting away from time and kinematics, the effects are going to be minimized.

27
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,740
And it's not going to be as impactful.

28
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:43,060
For example, we would expect that idea, such as momentum, kinetic energy, total energy, which are

29
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,230
dependent upon velocity to get these quantities in classical physics.

30
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:54,160
At least we'd expect them to have some weird effects pop out as a result of introducing these interesting

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,870
special relativity concepts.

32
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,070
However, ideas such as, you know, electrodynamics, which aren't as prominently influenced by kinematics,

33
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,000
so on and so forth, may not have as many effects.

34
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,970
They will have slight effects, but it won't be as drastic now.

35
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,490
In this video, we're going to start taking a look at those ripple effects.

36
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:21,790
We're going to see how introducing these ideas that we spend so much time coming up with in terms of

37
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:27,370
kinematics in spacetime, how special relativity effects that we're going to find that the ripple effect

38
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,470
drastically affects momentum in particular.

39
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:36,670
That's what we're going to focus on in this video now jumping into the idea of momentum.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Classically, we would expect that our notions, our classical notions are preserved, right?

41
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:51,310
Classically, we know that momentum, which is defined as M times V and as a factor, we would expect

42
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,900
that conservation of momentum to also be preserved.

43
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,440
OK, so we know that momentum is always conserved.

44
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,350
We'd expect this result preserved at high velocities, even after accepting the implications of special

45
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,830
relativity.

46
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,790
So we know right momentum is lost as mass times velocity.

47
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:16,630
And because our conservation of momentum implies that our initial momentum must be equivalent to a our

48
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,890
final momentum.

49
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,520
OK.

50
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,400
And then this can be reduced down to this guy right here.

51
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:29,710
So we would expect this to hold in special relativity because if it didn't, that would have huge implications,

52
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:29,980
right?

53
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,130
If momentum did not hold, then force Newton's second law.

54
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,000
You know, f is equal to the derivative of momentum of this back to time.

55
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,660
That would also break down, and they'll have huge implications, right?

56
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,410
We like Newtonian mechanics.

57
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,970
We like classical physics.

58
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,790
We want it to translate pretty well into special relativity.

59
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,990
So let's investigate this.

60
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,970
And in order to do that, what we're going to do is we're going to employ our best friends, right?

61
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,940
Terrance and Phillip, what they did is they had similar notions.

62
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,700
They thought that all these ideas would be drastically impacted by changing our basic notions of kinematics

63
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,100
in space time, and they want to investigate that.

64
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,570
What effect is this going to have upon momentum to do that?

65
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,820
What they're going to do is they're going to carry out.

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,190
A classical experiment that demonstrates momentum, but they're going to do it at high speeds, and

67
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,820
they're going to see how that high velocity.

68
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,750
Affects their notions, the classical notions of momentum, basically the conservation momentum, does

69
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,350
it hold up?

70
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,250
Does it fall apart or does it give rise to a new effect?

71
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,780
That's what we're going to investigate.

72
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,890
Let's do this.

73
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:50,400
They're going to take the classical experiment of a a ball or maybe some kind of any kind of object

74
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,990
coming in at the same velocities, hitting each other and having a perfectly elastic collision such

75
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,000
that they come out at the same velocity.

76
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:07,470
They're going to use this a bouncy ball, and Terence is going to hold that ball and spaceship that's

77
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,820
traveling close to the speed of light.

78
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,150
We're going to use zero point eight seven times the speed of light.

79
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,180
See, but you can use any kind of last thing you want.

80
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,440
And we're going to have Philip up on the ground watching him fly right by the both going to hold a bouncy

81
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:22,680
ball.

82
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:29,490
Now they timed it out such that at times equals zero and terrorists a little bit to the left of Philip.

83
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,770
They're both going to throw the ball in their respective reference frames straight down and straight

84
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:34,980
up.

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,510
Throws it down.

86
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:44,490
Philip throws it up and what's going to happen is they're going to hit at this point here at the same

87
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:44,820
speed.

88
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,170
Remember, they're going to bounce off in the perfectly elastic collision.

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,820
And then terrorists, it's going to catch it.

90
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,590
And Philip is going to catch hits.

91
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,610
This is a classical experiment.

92
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:03,760
We don't know what's going to happen at high speeds now to make this easy and straightforward.

93
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,440
Let's try and tabulate the different velocities of the balls at different times.

94
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:15,430
We're not two events, then no one when they the actually throw the ball and event number two when they

95
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,350
actually catch that ball.

96
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,880
Now, initially, when they both throw it, they're going to throw it either up or down with a velocity

97
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,570
of you.

98
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,050
Not.

99
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:35,110
So for even one over here, Philip Ball is going to throw it up with no exit velocity, but with a positive

100
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,150
y velocity of you not.

101
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,840
So that means that to fill up his philosophy in the X direction for event one is zero.

102
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,100
But his velocity in the Y direction for event one is you not.

103
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,630
And then in turns his ball in his reference frame.

104
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,220
What we're going to find is and I got to put a little.

105
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,870
Apostrophe right here to indicate that Terrance is the one measuring it's met, it's measured in reference

106
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,680
s prime.

107
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:11,810
What we find is that in the X direction, since he's throwing a straight down, it's going to look like

108
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,330
it goes straight down and it goes up.

109
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:14,960
Right?

110
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,820
There's going to be no x component.

111
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:25,340
So in the X, direction is lost near zero and in the Y direction, his ball has a velocity of negative.

112
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:33,650
You not go straight down with a speed of, you know, that's what they measure now from classical physics.

113
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,450
We know that in a perfectly elastic collision, right?

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:43,700
If the balls come up, let's say it's going to look something like this like that.

115
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
We're going to have a ball of mass m a ball mass m.

116
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,280
There's going to be you, not that's you, not then they're going to collide, they have to come back

117
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,620
with an equal but opposite.

118
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,470
Velocity.

119
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,800
Right.

120
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,620
That's what's implied by conservation of momentum, right?

121
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,520
That's what we get.

122
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,310
So what we know is that.

123
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,030
I can work it out.

124
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,500
This a very simple deduction, right?

125
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,070
So if we have that, they both have a massive and.

126
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,310
We have and you not.

127
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,420
That's Phillips Ball.

128
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,650
Minus and you not.

129
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,590
All right, so I'll call this guy, Phillip.

130
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,150
This guy, Terrence.

131
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,310
That must be equal to the final guy here, which would be Anton.

132
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,810
Some velocity plus and another velocity.

133
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,530
Basically, the final guy right here is going to be P.

134
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,660
This is T from this, we can deduce that.

135
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,520
This guy has to be negative, you not.

136
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,070
This guy has the positive you not.

137
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,500
And they reverse in sight.

138
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,040
Right?

139
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,520
This is straightforward ideas for physics, one to one.

140
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,330
So.

141
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,270
The Philippines has actually measure the velocity on the ball that they receive.

142
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:08,370
But we could deduce from classical physics and this is the beauty of conservation of momentum.

143
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:18,060
That the following is a true event to after a time Delta T Phillips ball, as measured by him, is going

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,550
to have a negative y component, you know, as we just discovered from the conservation of momentum,

145
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,300
but it did not change in the X direction, right?

146
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:34,110
So from from him, what we're going to say is that, oh, that guy zero four, the the X component of

147
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:42,320
the velocity and Terrence's ball, it's going to come straight up at that same velocity or same speed.

148
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,840
You're not.

149
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,410
So the y component of the velocity is positive, you not.

150
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,540
And the X component, as observed by parents, we need to put a little.

151
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,850
Posh, be there to signify that we are in the prime reference frame.

152
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,740
That's going to be zero.

153
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,560
Now we took these quantities.

154
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:05,490
It would appear as though conservation of momentum is guaranteed.

155
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,540
OK?

156
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,440
But.

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,380
We know that when you travel close to the speed of light, as we just discovered through Velocity Edition.

158
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,630
The each individual's conception of that losses and speed is going to be different in different reference

159
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,140
range, right?

160
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,350
Your experience of the phenomenon is contingent upon how you view it, your perspective, right?

161
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,920
This is what we've been discussing in the course that's the main tenet, the main idea.

162
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,150
So we would expect that if conservation of momentum.

163
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,430
Is true in in one reference frame.

164
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,490
It must be true in all initial reference frames, right?

165
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,090
That's just a restatement of the first of the special relativity.

166
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,780
So what we want to see is that using all of these ideas that we came up with from special relativity

167
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,410
lost the additional time dilation length contraction.

168
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,200
We want to see if this still holds right.

169
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,780
In every initial reference frame.

170
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,370
OK, so what we're going to do is we're going to do the same experiment.

171
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:16,620
But from Phillip's standpoint, in order to do that, what we need to do is we need to take these velocities

172
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:24,780
as measured by parents and translate them into the reference frame the rest frame in Phillips rest frame.

173
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,350
So let's do that now.

174
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:31,500
Fortunately, in our last video at the end of the class, the last section.

175
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:41,350
We found that we could quickly relate and put together this nice map in the last transformation to allow

176
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,890
Philip to talk intelligently about Terrence's velocities.

177
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,080
So let's do that right now.

178
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,500
OK?

179
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:54,490
What we're going to do is we're going to take those formulas exactly as they are and write them up.

180
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,410
So we're going to have to do it for the X direction and also the Y direction.

181
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,900
Let's focus first on the extraction.

182
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:03,160
What we're going to find is that.

183
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:16,750
The v x t Terrence's bond x direction for you, that one we're going to find is that we could get our

184
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,540
Velocity Edition formula and calculate it direct.

185
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:26,200
This is no different than the X prime, plus the relative.

186
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,360
Divide it by one.

187
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,390
Plus the relative.

188
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,050
Over C squared.

189
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,060
Times, V.X, Prof.

190
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,000
OK, so we could basically just plug and chug this guy.

191
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:49,970
We know that the prime this guy I'll put in the.

192
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:58,150
Exact notation, so we avoid confusion here, but we can throw this guy straight in here.

193
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,070
Bam.

194
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,290
That's zero bam zero one on the bottom, we get one plus zero.

195
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,900
Oh, this guy is nothing more than just derail the relative velocity.

196
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,660
This is what we find initially, and we could do the same thing.

197
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:23,790
For Event two, because we know this guy and we know that in inertial reference frame, the relative

198
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,250
remains concerned he zooms via the cause of last.

199
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:33,570
Well, we know that this guy is not changing, so we would get the same result, right?

200
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,300
This changes to a two of the team's two, a two.

201
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,040
We plug that guy straight in.

202
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,660
We end up with the same result.

203
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:47,520
So what we could do is we could just put the X to two that is equal to that guy and we get the result.

204
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:54,390
That's not surprising to somebody, stat. If you drop, if you're going at speed B and you drop a rock,

205
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,720
it's going to continue in the X direction.

206
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,810
Nothing is going to prevent it or stop it from traveling in the X direction.

207
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,680
This makes sense.

208
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,570
This drives well for our intuition.

209
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,010
We're on good track here, and that's why Philip is happy.

210
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,670
He's super happy.

211
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,370
Like all.

212
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,760
Yeah, baby, this is agreeing with my intuition, his degree of physics.

213
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,840
Let's continue.

214
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,680
We're going to find a conservation.

215
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,470
LATAM is concern to my preference for him.

216
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,200
I'm confident, you know, this is a classic idea.

217
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,180
It has to hold, has to hold no matter what.

218
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:27,420
OK, so what he does is, he says, OK, to continue this exercise, I need to figure out the Y component

219
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,450
so I can just pull out of my my bag of tricks.

220
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:38,940
Michael asked the addition formula, and I can calculate the wide Terrence's ball for state one event

221
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,420
one.

222
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,790
Well, I know from, you know, my my my hat tricks.

223
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,840
This guy is no more than v y t.

224
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,690
One, Prime.

225
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:04,420
Divided by our Lorentz factor times, one plus B rule, the relative over C squared.

226
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,010
Times.

227
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,590
The direction.

228
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,150
All right.

229
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:18,920
So what we can do.

230
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,740
Literally plug and chug, baby.

231
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,850
So we come down here, the next one, that's zero.

232
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,930
This guy cancels out.

233
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,450
That cancels, so we get one plus here, that's one we get a gallon bottom and we get nothing more than

234
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:35,960
a falling.

235
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,920
We could plug this guy in right down here, so that's a negative.

236
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,530
You not.

237
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,810
Over Gamma, and I'm going to write this guy in just so.

238
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,510
We can see the actual values this is negative.

239
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,020
You cannot divide it by the square root.

240
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,860
One minus v relative over C.

241
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,250
And it's quantity squared.

242
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,890
Basically, the Lorentz factor be OK, so that's what we end up with VI t two.

243
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,570
And we could do a similar calculation for event number two.

244
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,690
And we see the only difference is that you not.

245
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:30,020
The sign in front of you not changes, so you could deduce that, oh, we know this guy in here right

246
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:36,780
there, you know, we're going to get him on the bottom and we end up with the whitey.

247
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,490
Two is nothing more than positive.

248
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,870
You not.

249
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,000
Over the square root.

250
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:58,870
Of one minus the relative or C quantity squared is the same result, but it's opposite that.

251
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,410
That's what we discovered from using our classical idea is that the velocity is the same magnitude,

252
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,000
but has an opposite direction.

253
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,850
OK, so that's not very surprising.

254
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,110
But now we have all the ingredients to take this guy here.

255
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Our conservation rule, and that's a formula for all these guys in and see what really happens.

256
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:27,410
But before we do that, what I want to do is record these ideas so you have them right in front of you.

257
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,620
What I'm going to say is that I put it down here the X.

258
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,120
He won.

259
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,670
Is equal to the relative.

260
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,390
So we get that guy there.

261
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,740
And to put the wine.

262
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,830
T one.

263
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,960
We're gonna bring that guy over there.

264
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,340
We're going to write it in here.

265
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,770
We get negative view, not.

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,540
Over square root one minus B or C.

267
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,080
On squared.

268
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,490
Little difficult to see that, and I'm just going to highlight this.

269
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,140
Sort of running out of board space here, I apologize.

270
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,000
So we end up with that result.

271
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,510
And we also want to record the same exact result right over here.

272
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,420
So we end up with the X T.

273
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:42,620
That's also a relative, and the Y Terrence's ball or state two is a positive.

274
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:51,160
You know what, the square root of one minus the relative or C squared?

275
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,000
All right.

276
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,410
So we end up with these guys.

277
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,700
Very important results.

278
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:04,090
And what we want to do is now plug them in the conservation of momentum formula.
