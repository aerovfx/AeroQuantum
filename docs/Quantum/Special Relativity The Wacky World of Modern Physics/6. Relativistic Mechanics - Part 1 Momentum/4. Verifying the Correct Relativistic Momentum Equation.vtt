1
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.670
All right.

2
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.580
So we just discovered this apparent ripple effect, which influence the way the universe manifests this

3
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.880
quantity of momentum.

4
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:33.020
What we want to do is take that supposed candidate relativistic momentum and throw it into Terrence

5
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.360
and Phillips experiment to see if we can rectify the problem they ran into with taking a look at conservation

6
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.540
of momentum in the Y direction.

7
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.860
So in essence, what we're going to do is to take this equation again Delta P plus Delta T r the momentum

8
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.750
of the balls, and we're going to make sure that it equals zero, that these guys are equal magnitude,

9
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.610
but opposite in sight.

10
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.680
Now, if we take that candidate and throw it into both these qualities, what we find is that Delta

11
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.810
P must be defined as follows and Delta T must be defined as follows.

12
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.250
Again, the momentum term is going to be defined as the events factor in terms of the velocity times

13
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.550
a m times the velocity, and that's going to be the same for each component.

14
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.120
So most textbooks actually omit all the stuff here because a lot of math.

15
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.810
So be patient with me or I'm going to be reading up a lot on the board.

16
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.030
Hopefully, I don't make mistakes, but I want you guys to feel confident in this idea, and I want

17
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.560
it to be a journey for you so that you personally discover the psyche idea.

18
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.620
And I think you learn physics best by doing physics.

19
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.790
So let's do just that.

20
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.870
Let's do the physics.

21
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.740
All right.

22
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.710
So what we're going to do is we're going to focus first on Delta P P, and I'm going to remind you about

23
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.120
the velocities we calculated previously, just because we don't have that enough here.

24
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.580
You can backtrack in the video if you want to confirm that I'm using the correct value, but you can

25
00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.120
trust me.

26
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.260
You can trust me.

27
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.740
So we're going to take this guy here first, and we're going to calculate this.

28
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.540
This is nothing more than Delta peop.

29
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.180
We're going to take gamma.

30
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.850
I'm going to drop the B, but that's going to be the speed.

31
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.900
We know the speed and Phillips reference frame when he throws the ball up, that's just you.

32
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.230
Not.

33
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.460
So you know what?

34
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.570
It's going to be used in here.

35
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.940
Not very interesting ideas pop out as a result of them to put down here for now.

36
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.450
We know that initially the ball with or the ball's mass, I want to say weigh in and mess that up.

37
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.020
The ball's mass is M and its velocity.

38
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.370
You know, this is no more than just, you know, so we get that guy.

39
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.440
It's actually, yeah, it's actually negative for state too, because it's going back down and we have

40
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.390
minus gamma and you not for initially it's going thrown up.

41
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.100
So this gives us nothing more than to am.

42
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:04.770
You're not over the square root of one minus, is you not again, it's the speed of the particle.

43
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.790
This is where we diverge from what we're using with Garrett before.

44
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.710
I don't get confusing calculations.

45
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.920
You always want to use the speed of the object, not the speed of the reference frame, because a lot

46
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.480
of people make mistakes doing that.

47
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.730
So if you need to do something like this to make you feel confident about the camera you're using.

48
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.270
OK, so that guy received this quantity squared.

49
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.950
OK, so we get this, and it sort of looks like what we had previously for Delta PC, which is a good

50
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.450
sign of a really good sign.

51
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.070
That's what we want to do is fix the error I made.

52
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.060
I already made a mistake.

53
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.980
You guys should have told me should've held up.

54
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.600
So we have to put in a negative sign here because I, you know, I forgot the negative sign, but that's

55
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.500
what we're going to use for Delta.

56
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.210
And I'm going to just write that down right here to make sure we have it.

57
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.030
And I can make some more space because the next guy's going to be a little ugly.

58
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.530
So little warning.

59
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.160
There is one minus you not oversee, not quantity square.

60
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.630
So we take this guy.

61
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.830
We're going to throw it away, and we're going to do is going to get dealt a pity for terrasses ball

62
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.070
and what is complicated about this.

63
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.030
Is the fact that the velocity that we're going to use in the Lawrence Factor, it has an X component

64
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.350
and a Y component.

65
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.340
OK.

66
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.100
So what we want to do first is get the magnitude and then we can throw it in to this Lorenz factor.

67
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.530
So what we needed to find out is, in essence, we want to find the Y T as measured in the frame and

68
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.390
Phillips reference frame.

69
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.640
So but a little bracket there for magnitude two brackets.

70
00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.680
And what we need to do is, as we do in classical physics, this is no more than the X.

71
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:13.330
Now, I want the entire velocity, so this is v x t squared plus v y t squared.

72
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.870
And when we throw in the wash, these we had previously, we know that the X direction was no more than

73
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.760
the relative square.

74
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.670
But the why direction is a little more convoluted because of the Alaska edition formula that we had

75
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.060
to use.

76
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.890
So what we end up with is.

77
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:50.580
You not you're not squared times the quantity one minus the relative oversee.

78
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.280
Squared.

79
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:59.650
And in this case, it's the relative, because we're using the old Velocity Edition formula, remember

80
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.070
time, space and velocity.

81
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.470
They transform using a gamma f depending upon the relative velocity of the frames.

82
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.180
In momentum, we use the actual magnitude of the moving object, so we get something like this.

83
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.250
And you know, we look at this, it's not nice.

84
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:27.900
It's partly why textbooks omit this exercise, but we can rectify this and we can really make it work.

85
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.400
So what we're going to do?

86
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.730
Is.

87
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:41.810
Subtract those guys put in the y t two minus v y t at one.

88
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.350
And we're going to try and solve for this guy first.

89
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.400
It's going to be a little complicated, but we can do it.

90
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.860
We could do it.

91
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.760
We're good physicists.

92
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.020
We're good mathematicians.

93
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.420
Lifted.

94
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:57.810
So when we actually try and plug that guy in.

95
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.520
Use the lost, the formula, the threads factory.

96
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.410
This guy becomes.

97
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.020
We're going to get one.

98
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:21.010
Over this huge bracket is the one over one minus the this guy over C squared.

99
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.200
So it's it gets really convoluted and that's why I'm sort of hesitated.

100
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.580
So we have one minus one over c squared times.

101
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.380
This whole quantity squared.

102
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:33.190
OK.

103
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.970
So what we end up with is the relative.

104
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.460
Squared.

105
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.710
Plus, you not square times that.

106
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.550
All right.

107
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.150
Bear with me, there's a lot of convoluted math here.

108
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.440
It's not nice.

109
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.330
We're going to make it work.

110
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.090
We're going to make this work, though, OK, so we end up with that guy.

111
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.210
All under this radical.

112
00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:07.190
And then we need to multiply by M times, b y t two, so what we end up with is over here, we got in

113
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.940
and.

114
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.080
And remember VE y at the end, it's coming up.

115
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.400
So it's a positive value.

116
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:16.140
And we determined from the blast the addition formula.

117
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:24.350
This is no more than you, not times the radical one, minus the relative over C.

118
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.650
Quantity squared.

119
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.070
OK, so we got this huge monstrosity.

120
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.360
What in the world are we going to do?

121
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.080
What are we going to do?

122
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:33.740
We can.

123
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.280
We can simplify this a bit by making note of the following.

124
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:48.080
So we end up with actually one over one minus PRL oversea squared minus you.

125
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.180
Not over, see?

126
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.230
Quantity squared.

127
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.610
I miss the square here.

128
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.450
Sorry about that.

129
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:06.270
And all this is multiplied by one minus V realm over C quantity squared times.

130
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.750
And you know, this guy comes along for the ride.

131
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.930
One minus very well over C.

132
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:14.870
He's just chilling up there.

133
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:15.780
Not very interesting.

134
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:25.350
And what we see is that the one minus v l c squared this quantity group that for you, this guy.

135
00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:34.810
Minus this times the same thing, so we can factor out this the same thing and multiply by one to get

136
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.450
this guy minus you over C squared.

137
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:38.170
OK.

138
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.780
So what we end up with is and I apologize for the lack of board space.

139
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.950
We got one.

140
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:51.680
Over the square root of one minus the rail.

141
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.710
Oversee quantity square in brackets.

142
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:04.250
Times one minus, you do not oversee quantity squared.

143
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:11.110
In brackets and in this guy we can throw right up here.

144
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.730
Amie, you not.

145
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.820
And the square root of one minus v, veral.

146
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:25.980
Over, see what you square, and it's the point where we realize that this is a convoluted exercise

147
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.080
and we need more words this right?

148
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.070
So we try and make more board space here.

149
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.720
And what we find is that.

150
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.840
After we do so, we start getting smart and we find this guy here.

151
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.830
The same term as this guy here.

152
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.620
And we can cancel them out, in essence.

153
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:51.100
OK.

154
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.150
So this guy.

155
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.910
Cancels out with that guy.

156
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:56.800
At the same time.

157
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.310
And this becomes no more than an.

158
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.280
You not divided by the square root.

159
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.010
One is you not.

160
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.050
Over C squared.

161
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:26.070
Our as we take this guy, we look at Delta up, and it seems like it's in the same or.

162
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.120
So it looks like we're on the right track.

163
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.470
Let's keep making progress.

164
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.080
So what we know for the second term is this for the first term.

165
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.530
We know that it had an equal but opposite sign, an equal and opposite sign.

166
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.470
So this is equal to two.

167
00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.980
That guy is equal to that and through, you know, we're just changing one sign.

168
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.660
We would expect to get the same thing with a change, not for the first part.

169
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.730
I'm not going to walk through that.

170
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.670
I should be self-explanatory.

171
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.530
M ui t one.

172
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:11.990
This guy?

173
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:26.790
Becomes negative and you cannot over root one minus you not oversee the quantity squared.

174
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.290
So let me take this.

175
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.310
We take that guy.

176
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:36.630
Minus this, what we end up with is we get a two.

177
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:44.040
I mean, you're not divided by the square root of one minus.

178
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:50.050
You not oversee quantity squared.

179
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:57.540
So this is the big moment, the big moment with the win, and Terrance and Phillip are super excited.

180
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.650
They're seeing this.

181
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.000
Their eyes are popping out.

182
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.620
They're smiling big.

183
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.830
Take this guy, we say.

184
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.370
This is no more than we can plot these guys in negative two.

185
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.950
And you're not.

186
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:26.800
Over the square root of one minus, you not oversee quantity squared plus two and you not over the square

187
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.950
root of one minus you're not over c squared, does that equals zero?

188
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.360
Yes, indeed.

189
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.590
We have found that, at least in Phillip's reference frame.

190
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.150
That our candidate solution for momentum.

191
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.830
This guy right here.

192
00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:51.800
It's correct.

193
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.060
So.

194
00:13:54.250 --> 00:14:01.630
We find that by looking at what we did previously and special relativity to give rise to these weird

195
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.770
relativistic effects.

196
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:10.340
We found that capping the velocity so that we don't reach the speed of light or beyond it leads to weird

197
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.570
effects of high velocities.

198
00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:18.170
We threw this factor in, looked at the proper time and that yielded the correct result.

199
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.470
This is how momentum is modified.

200
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:27.800
Next, what we're going to do is we're going to take a look at this and the implications it has because

201
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.060
they're very odd.

202
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.050
They're very weird.

203
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.060
And in fact, a lot of physicists disagree in terms of what this implies.

204
00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:41.000
And if you use the different ideas, we're going to resolve it and we're going to understand what ripple

205
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.540
effect we just introduced into the body of physics.

206
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.440
OK, we're going to use that a starting point and next investigate energy.

207
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:49.370
Stay tuned.
