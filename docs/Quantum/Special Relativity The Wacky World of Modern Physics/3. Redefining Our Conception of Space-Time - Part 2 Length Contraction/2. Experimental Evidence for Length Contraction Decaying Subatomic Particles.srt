1
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,360
Now, in terms of experimental evidence, as I said previously, we can use the same ideas and notions

2
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,150
that were used to prove time dilation, but I want to spend some time talking about one event.

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,410
One use of proving this that I talked about previously for time dilation, which was the decay of subatomic

4
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:37,790
particles.

5
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,320
Now when we talked about that, where time dilation.

6
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,810
What we found is that the half life, which is the time it takes for half of the population of subatomic

7
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:56,190
particles to decay, to vanish and disappear, that time is dilated.

8
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,400
And that extra time allows it to survive a sufficient amount of time to get to its destination.

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:10,410
And this is taken advantage of and used to prove both time dilation and length contraction actually

10
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,850
in a lot of experiments in particle collider.

11
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:20,550
So what we usually have is we usually have two protons of tiny particles coming in and they collide

12
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:27,360
within a particle accelerator in that collision gives rise to a particle known as a pi on which I have

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,140
labeled here.

14
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,830
And what happens is we usually don't do any kind of experiment with that particle actually right where

15
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,470
the collision occurs, because you try to, you want to try to avoid that.

16
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,440
You know, that's a very high energy collision.

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,620
You want to avoid that for safety concerns.

18
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:50,550
So what they usually do is they have a pipe that the pion travels down to an experimental site.

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,530
We can actually do stuff with that.

20
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,530
That particle now based upon time relation and what was used and actually theorized by Einstein.

21
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:05,700
If you take the half life of a pylon that is measured in the moving reference frame, as we talked about

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,780
with triangulation, right?

23
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,290
The the life that actually sees that is in a moving reference frame.

24
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:21,170
So we know that the birth and the death of a particle occurs in the same point on that that pylon.

25
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,460
So that has to be the proper time.

26
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,400
As we talked about previously and as a result of that, the time in the lab reference frame in the stationary

27
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,680
reference frame has to get dilated.

28
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:40,860
So what we find is that you have to size the pipe a bit longer to correspond with that time to account

29
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,220
for it.

30
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,770
So what you find is that Delta rather t. the Half-Life.

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,970
He one half.

32
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,930
This has to be dilated.

33
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,610
On the proper Half-Life.

34
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,700
So we get something like that.

35
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,680
And the actual time in the lab reference frame that we observe is much longer.

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,180
So if we didn't have this time dilation?

37
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,630
It would actually die before got or decayed before we actually got to the end of the tube.

38
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,150
You would not observe any particles right there would be gone would be poof vanished into thin air.

39
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,850
Now what if we go into a different reference frame, the reference frame that moves with the pylon?

40
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,970
In that case, what you would say is OK, by the time we get to half the pipe, all the particles vanished

41
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,890
and we're not going to reach the end, the end.

42
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,460
But that can't be true because we know that we actually observe them in the experimental site.

43
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,320
So there has to be some other idea, some other kind of physical phenomenon that arises.

44
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,890
Well, in this situation, what we know is the length that is the proper length.

45
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:02,650
As I said, it's in the rest rest reference frame where the two events occur, the two events at the

46
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,280
beginning and the end of the pipe that occurs in the lab reference frame, right?

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,190
That tube is not moving, according to the lab.

48
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:18,670
So what you say is you see this put in or now not for this length is the proper length and what the

49
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,310
pilot actually sees from his reference frame.

50
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,860
It looks like this tube is moving up right instead of going, look, that it's it looks like this guy

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,190
is moving up with a velocity v close to the speed of light because pylons travel at a very high speed

52
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,010
and that makes the Lorentz factor very high.

53
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,160
So from this reference frame, when he is just sitting stationary, that pylon, it looks like this

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,510
is moving towards it, so he reaches the end destination.

55
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:54,850
In a shorter amount of time when he decays down here because this distance is shorter, so from his

56
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,430
perspective, it looks like this is moving up.

57
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,040
So he doesn't have to travel as far as.

58
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,860
As it looks like in the lab reference frame, so for him, his L is no more than the life contraction,

59
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,970
we take the proper life.

60
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,230
The Viper Lorentz factor and that phenomenon allows it to get to the destination because what we all

61
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,330
agree on is the fact that if we observe it in the lab reference frame, in the pilot reference frame,

62
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,440
it has to get there.

63
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,390
It has to exist, right?

64
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,440
So in the lab reference frame, time dilation allows the possibility of this experiment, allows it

65
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,280
to get down here.

66
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,630
But in the pion reference frame, the tube looks like it's moving, so it doesn't travel based upon

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:46,770
its perception as far as what the lab measures, because it looks like that's moving.

68
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:53,070
So that disparity between the two sort of couples time dilation and length contraction, and you'll

69
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,050
see them arise in opposite reference frames.

70
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:05,760
But the key idea is this is a true fact, maybe weird or maybe strange and maybe taking a slap in the

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,320
face of our intuition.

72
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,400
What we take for granted right the measure of something space time.

73
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,130
But it's a true, verifiable fact that we have proven many, many times in different experimental situations.

74
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,890
OK, so what have we discovered?

75
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,010
What we have done in this video is we took a step back.

76
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:32,610
Initially, we had to go straight into the wacky world of special relativity.

77
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:41,250
We found that time dilates or that a moving clock is observed to move slow to tick, slow that time

78
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,490
dilation said, Hey, different conceptions of reality may have different flows of time.

79
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,360
Well, we took that fact and we used different ideas that it stipulates that different times between

80
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,130
reference frames and also that we agree about the velocity between two reference frames.

81
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:07,260
Those two ideas gave birth to an apparent discrepancy that if the velocity is constant.

82
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,650
Then what is measured between two different reference frames as such?

83
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:18,070
Must be different because time is different.

84
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,600
So these guys must be different and that give rise to the notion of length contraction, right?

85
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,610
Or rather the idea that.

86
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,480
The life of an object when it's moving, observed by a stationary reference frame, it's going to be

87
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,200
contracting, it's going to get smaller.

88
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,540
And as we saw, that is due to the fact because in the moving reference frame, it looks like that length

89
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,460
is moving towards you.

90
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,430
So that decreased the length that has to be traveled, but that is contingent upon your reference frame,

91
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:51,670
right?

92
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,880
Your perspective prize your 120 eyes.

93
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,360
Your perspective dictates the phenomenon that arises in front of you.

94
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:04,990
So now different phenomena and different results may arise based upon your perception.

95
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:11,500
But we started building that nice bridge that helps us get this universal absolute conception of the

96
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,280
universe, right?

97
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,390
So Terrance and Phillip may disagree about the length they observe, but using this idea using these

98
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:26,080
these tools they developed, they can say, Hey, we bridge the gap between these, these differing

99
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,070
perspectives.

100
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,860
We're able to get some universal conception of reality.

101
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,120
Life is good.

102
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:31,940
Life is good.

103
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,290
All right.

104
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,700
So that's length contraction.

105
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,470
It's a little weird, but it's true.

106
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,280
It's a true observable fact.

107
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,780
Yes.

108
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:43,660
And looks like life does get smaller when objects start moving close to the speed of light.

109
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:48,490
Next, what we're going to do is going to run through a little example problem to help you get used

110
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:55,210
to working with these ideas, working with length contraction and the result we get may be interesting.

111
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,020
We're also going to visit something that is known as Einstein's train paradox.

112
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:06,400
And I'm going to show you some weird ideas that arise again by accepting length, contraction and time

113
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,030
dilation.

114
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,410
Stay tuned.
