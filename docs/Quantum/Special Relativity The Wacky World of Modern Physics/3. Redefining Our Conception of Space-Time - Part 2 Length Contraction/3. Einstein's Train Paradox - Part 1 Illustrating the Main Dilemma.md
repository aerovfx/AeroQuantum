### Đoạn 1

All right, in our last lesson, we go a bit further down the wacky world of special relativity and we learn about a new relativistic effect known as length contraction. What do we find out? We discovered that a moving body is observed to be contracted, that in a rest frame.

### Đoạn 2

If we observe an entity that's moving any kind of length in that reference frame will appear to be shortened. OK, so this is known as length contraction and compared to our everyday experience of length of things in the world, in the universe, this idea was very weird. It was very contrary to how we would experience things.

### Đoạn 3

We in general, we we feel like the length or the way which measure the length of an object should not change if there's any relative motion between the two. OK, so this implied effect of life contraction is weird in and of itself. So what I want to do in this video is run through a quick example with you.

### Đoạn 4

I'm holding your hand. Help you to build up intuition with this weird effect so you can understand it. And then I'll unleash you to do your own kind of problems by yourself to learn independently. In this video, we're going to run through an example, and it's going to divulge a very weird effect

### Đoạn 5

that arises as a result of length contraction, right? As we have seen in previous lessons, previous effects we've uncovered, right? It may arise some weird relativistic effect, but if you dive further down into the rabbit hole, it just gets weirder and weirder and weirder.

### Đoạn 6

OK, so we're going to make things strange or we're going to challenge your interpretation of this idea, challenge your conception of the universe and open your eyes to what is actually happening at relativistic speeds. OK, so the problem we're going to take a look at is the following OK, we're going to have terrorism

### Đoạn 7

fill up. They're going to do a new experiment. They discover this weird effects that they want to build intuition with it, with you. Two.

### Đoạn 8

So what they do is they buy a standard box car, which has a length of fifty five point four two feet and that was looked up by standard manufacturers of box cars. And what they're going to do is Terence, he says, OK, I'm going to travel up some speed and I'm going to travel into this tunnel.

### Đoạn 9

The question is, if Philip, you're observing this on Earth, how fast do I have to travel such that my life, according to you, is contracted is shortened so that this tunnel can encapsulate my life so that I can shrink to such an amount that I fit inside this tunnel, OK? So the problem statement officially says the pose that a standard boxcar of life 55 point forty two

### Đoạn 10

feet is about to travel through a tunnel of like 20 feet. So this guy 20 feet, how fast must it travel? Such an observer sees the train fit inside the tunnel. OK, so what have you kind of problems and special relativity?

### Đoạn 11

The first thing you want to do is get your bearings straight. OK, what is the proper length? What is the proper time? OK, so first and foremost, what we're dealing with here is length contraction.

### Đoạn 12

We're going to focus on the mike, but it might be a valuable exercise to also identify the proper time. So what we learned in the last video is that the proper length is the length of which it's the reference frame where measuring the length of something jives, well, her intuition, right? And that occurs in the rest frame, right?

### Đoạn 13

When we measure something generally, we don't move it. We keep it stationary. We figure out the left and the right side and then we measure it. And that occurs in a rest frame.

### Đoạn 14

That's the best way to do it. That's how we do it in everyday life situations. So what we found is that the proper length is defined as the reference frame where the object is stationary. OK, and then life gets contract in the reference frame, where that object is moving relative to the

### Đoạn 15

rest room. So what situation implies that the life of this guy is stationary? Well, or rather at rest, well in is frame. What he sees is he's in the car and he does not think that the boxcar is moving at all because he's

### Đoạn 16

moving at the same speed as the boxcar. What he sees is it looks like the tunnel is moving towards him. So in his reference frame, the length of the boxcar is at rest and he would measure it just as we do in any kind of everyday situation, right?

### Đoạn 17

You pull out that measuring tape, figure out the left side, figure out the right side and measure it. So based upon that, that I guess interpretation of what's going on, we would say the proper length would be intact.

### Đoạn 18

This is a reference frame right there, so I'm going to put that element right there. We know that in his reference frame, the car fifty five point four two feet is not going to change. So this is going to be fifty five point four two feet now if we're doing things related to time. We would also want to measure the proper, yeah, the proper time.

### Đoạn 19

OK. In this situation, we're going to skip that. OK. So this is the proper light, according to Terrence.

### Đoạn 20

So Philip is going to see a contract at length, and we want to specify the philosophy it takes for this guy to look like it contracted to fit inside this guy. But. Just taking the life right here, we know that this guy is going to be 20 feet.

### Đoạn 21

That's what it is, regardless of a reference frame. And we need to figure out the velocity that Terrence has to travel. What should he set the car to travel, such as it looks like to him that it fits inside this tunnel? OK, so we can do that by taking advantage of what we just arrived our life contraction formula so we

### Đoạn 22

could take L is equal to L not. Over. Gamma, and I'm going to back up a bit here. I want to specify this as well is the length time that we want this guy to shrink to, OK?

### Đoạn 23

Because remember, this is the proper length it's going to be shaped by this shrunk by this Lorentz factor. And then it's going to be that we want this to be the same life as this guy. OK, so we know these parameters.

### Đoạn 24

We know Elmo, and we know. OK, so let's factor we know is one over the square root of one, minus the relativistic velocity PETA squared. So if we divide by this, the radical flips up.

### Đoạn 25

So this just becomes nothing more than Elmont times the square root of one minus theta square. So if we want to solve for the velocity we need to solve for beta, because remember, theta is the relativistic velocity. It's just B over C.

### Đoạn 26

All right. So how can we do this? What we could do is we could square both sides. We can get el squared is equal to Elmont squared.

### Đoạn 27

Times one minus beta squared. And then we could divide this guy over there to get. Elsewhere over Elmont Square. And.

### Đoạn 28

We accept set that equal to one minus beta square. Now what we could do is we could add the beta squared over here. Move this guy over there by subtracting it, and then we could take the square root. So I'll do it in a criminal statute.

### Đoạn 29

Make sure you guys are following along with me. So data comes over here, we get the data squared and then we get a one minus L over L not. And I'm going to write it as such, right? Because if we write as such, the square applies to both terms.

### Đoạn 30

And all we have left to do is just to say well. Data. The square root is equal to the square root of one minus L or El Norte. And then we square the sky.

### Đoạn 31

So with this guy, we can use this to figure out, well, the relativistic velocity. That's let's be pretty straightforward. So that's going to be just multiplied by C. We take better multiply by C. And we get one minus L.

### Đoạn 32

Over Elmont, this guy squared and multiply it by a factor of C. OK, so what we could do? What's left is we just plug and chug, plug in the parameters we've identified, and that's why it's important to identify the proper length.

### Đoạn 33

Just plug it in there. And that will tell us how fast tenants will have to travel to shrink to the size of that tunnel. OK. So if I check my notes, we got the same exact result.

### Đoạn 34

So that's good. And what we need to do is we need to just plug it shocks. Let's do that. So we write the square root.

### Đoạn 35

We put one minus. We want the Lincoln Tunnel right here as identified 20 feet. Over the proper length of 55 point four. And we want to square these guys and then multiply by 50.

### Đoạn 36

So if we whip out to 83 and plot these numbers straight in, we plug and chug chug along. We find that the train will have to chug along at a value of zero point nine three three times the speed of light. OK, so.

### Đoạn 37

It's not surprising that we have to go close to the speed of light because relativistic effects such as length, contraction and time dilation. Occur when we're traveling close to the speed of light. OK, so this says and this is a remarkable feature, remarkable fact.

### Đoạn 38

This is verifiable. This is exactly what we would observe in real life if this actually happened. But what we find is that if parents travels at a velocity of zero point nine three three times the speed of light to fill up, it's going to look as though this guide short shrinks down to the size of this

### Đoạn 39

tunnel. And it will fit inside of the tunnel. Whoa. That's a crazy, crazy idea, right?

### Đoạn 40

So that really takes a slap in the face of our intuition, of our everyday conception of reality. OK. But we've sort of seen that. So it's not a surprising this is what we would have expected.

### Đoạn 41

But as I said in the beginning of the year, we're going to dive a bit deeper. OK. So fill up. This conception of what would happen here is correct.

### Đoạn 42

Let's take a deeper look at what Terrence is going to observe. What is he going to observe? So for him in his situation, as I said, it looks like the train is stationary and both fill up and the tunnel are going to be moving towards him.

### Đoạn 43

So as I mentioned in the last video, there's an inherent asymmetry that is built into this effect, right? He may see a life contraction fill up, that is, but Terrence may also observe a life contraction, and they're both right.

### Đoạn 44

They're both right. Right. Because your experience of the universe is nothing more than your perspective than the way in which you perceive events transpiring in front of you.

### Đoạn 45

So, according to Terrence, if it looks like this is moving well, you know, the applied effect of life contraction is that a moving body is observed to contract. So to him. It will look as though the title contracts, even though to fill up, that does not contract.

### Đoạn 46

And he's right, he's right. So that's what I feel sort of scratching his head. He's like, Yo, Terrence, what are you talking about, man? That makes no sense.

### Đoạn 47

I don't observe that. You're crazy, bro. So let's take a deeper look at this. So according to him, what he's going to say is.

### Đoạn 48

Fill up, you know, this is stationary and his reference frame, so now according to fill up, this is the proper length. And the life he measures is going to be. And then it becomes L, it becomes L, so again, the implied effect is that a moving body is observed

### Đoạn 49

to be contracted. So he's less moving. It has to get smaller. Let's calculate what that would have to be.

### Đoạn 50

So we just use the same exact formula. These guys are just sort of flipped. So according to two, I'll put a little line there, according to Terrence. He's going to say the length of the tunnel is going to be contracted as such.

### Đoạn 51

OK. So what we could do is, you know. The Lorentz factor, the square root pops up, we get nothing more than Elmont and the square root of one minus B the squared.

### Đoạn 52

You know, PETA is no more than point ninety three million plug in show up. So. In this case, the proper length is going to be the 20. So we get 20 feet times the square root of one minus zero point nine three three.

### Đoạn 53

Quantity squared and that's going to be equal to wait for this. Wait for it. Wait for it.

### Đoạn 54

Three six feet. That's right, it gets contracted to two point three six feet. Wait a minute. If Phillips says that this guy is going to shrink down to a size, that's 20 feet.

### Đoạn 55

And he's got to feet in the tunnel. But Terrence says that the tunnel is going to shrink from 20 feet to two point three six feet. And according to him, the length of his car, which is fifty five point four two feet. There's no way it could fit inside of this.

### Đoạn 56

Well, what's going on? According to Einstein Phillips, right? Terrence is right to. You want to scratch your head, like fill up.

### Đoạn 57

How can they both be right when their conclusions contradict each other? What's going on here? What's going on here?
