1
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,540
All right.

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,940
Up to this point in the course, we dive pretty deep into the wacky world, a special relativity as

3
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,980
we've been working to try and bridge the gap between different perceptions of reality and try to come

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,580
up with this nice universal conception of the universe.

5
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,660
What have we found so far so far in terms of relativistic effects?

6
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,540
We've only really discussed one important concept.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,320
What we found is that by accepting the two postulates a special relativity which state that one, the

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,190
laws of physics are going to arise in any kind of inertial reference frame.

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,590
And two, the speed of light is always going to be constant, and that's going to be consistent between

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,640
different reference frames.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,050
By accepting these two principles, the consequence that arises is the fact that my conception of time

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,950
may not be the same conception of time that you have.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,360
In other words, time flows differently in different reference frames.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,490
Now, the name of this phenomenon that we came up with was known as time dilation.

15
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,180
Or another way of expressing that is that a moving clock observed tends to move slow.

16
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,420
So if we have observed some, some individual in a spaceship that's going close to the speed of light.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,920
His conception of time is going to be slower or rather his conception of time is he's going to have

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,190
a smaller length of time between two events compared to somebody on Earth that's observing that same

19
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,740
situation right in his shoes.

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:54,330
Time dilates, or it's going to take longer for those two events to surmise.

21
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,690
Right?

22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,980
So this is sort of a very weird effect time dilation, as we've discussed, and it sort of puts a slap

23
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,530
in the face of our basic intuition and what we generally observe from a day to day basis.

24
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:13,350
Now what we're going to do is we're going to rejoin Terrence's fill up as they start looking more into

25
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,420
relativistic effects that arise in different situations that they try to experiment with.

26
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,560
And what we're going to find is that by accepting time dilation, this wacky phenomenon that has a lot

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:33,390
of strange implications already associated with it by accepting it, it's going to give rise to a contradicting

28
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,790
situation that doesn't really make sense.

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,050
And we're going to want to try and resolve that situation before we delve into it.

30
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:46,770
I want to illustrate the contradiction that arises and hopefully allow you to really see that with your

31
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,470
own eyes, OK?

32
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,840
So by accepting what we've just studied and what we've just discovered in terms of thought time dilation,

33
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,810
there are two important consequences that arise.

34
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,460
First of all, what I have here is number one.

35
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,600
All inertial reference frames agree that the relative motion between them is a constant value V and

36
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,340
all physical laws are invariant.

37
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,650
So the second part of this statement that all physical laws are invariant, that's nothing more than

38
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,800
a restatement of the first postulate a special relativity.

39
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,800
And furthermore, this should not be strange, right?

40
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:31,650
We have agreed by design, by design that if my relative motion is if I'm going on a console velocity

41
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,160
v.

42
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,050
My conception of that motion is going to be the same velocity V.

43
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:37,810
Right?

44
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,250
That's not strange at all.

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,170
We see that in everyday situations, right?

46
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:49,570
If you hop in a car and you drive, maybe to pick up some dinner, for example, your velocity as measured

47
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,130
by your speedometer is going to match the velocity as somebody measures on the ground.

48
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,720
So that's not earth-shattering.

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,090
That's not super interesting.

50
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,770
Let's dive a bit deeper.

51
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,560
The other thing we discovered was time dilation, right?

52
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:10,150
And time dilation insinuated that different conceptions of time based upon your your perception of reality,

53
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:17,240
your perspective, if you will, that's going to change how fast or how slowly time is going to progress.

54
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,500
Right?

55
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,420
So that's part two time deletion implies that a moving clock, if observed to take slow or that Delta

56
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:34,150
T for an observer observing the motion, the moving rocket that is defined by this Lorenz factor gamma

57
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,840
times the proper time Delta T not now.

58
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,270
If you look at these two statements, that velocity is always agreed upon between multiple reference

59
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,580
frames, at least that their inertial reference frames.

60
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,710
And also that their time is different.

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,420
Can you see any kind of contradiction associated with that?

62
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,620
Well, what Terrance and Phillip did is they sat down and they started looking at different physics.

63
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,040
They said, Hey, if this didn't gel well with our intuition, with everyday situations, maybe other

64
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,030
phenomena arise.

65
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:11,750
Other relative is a relativistic effects come into play when we start going or traveling close to the

66
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,530
speed of light.

67
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,450
And when they looked at these two ideas here, what they said was that.

68
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,170
Hmm.

69
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,390
If the velocity is constant between multiple reference frames, but the time is different.

70
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,280
Doesn't that suggest that something weird is going on associated with the light?

71
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:35,000
For example, if we just take basic physics physics one one baby, we take Delta X equal to V.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,040
Delta T v is constant, but the T changes between a two reference frames.

73
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,250
Well, that would imply contradictory evidence or that imply that Delta X has to be different.

74
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:46,850
Right?

75
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,050
Can you see that?

76
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,060
But that's very strange, right?

77
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:57,980
Because if we take this marker here and I look at it well, it might be, you know, maybe half a foot

78
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,840
eight, six inches.

79
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,550
So I would say it's six inches in a rest frame.

80
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,010
But if somebody takes it and moves with it, you would say, OK, who cares?

81
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,700
That relative motion does not change the length of this actual object.

82
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,050
So at first glance, that seems contradictory, right?

83
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,710
How could the length change?

84
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,730
But that is implied by these two, these two implications here.

85
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,350
So what tends to fill up do if they say, Hey, wait a second, whoa, wait a second.

86
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,010
I cannot agree with these two guys.

87
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:35,930
If it contradicts something that I take for granted, so I am not going to prescribe my ideas, my confessions

88
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,300
of reality onto the situation in front of me.

89
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:44,510
Rather, I'm going to take my preconceived notions of the universe or throw them into the trash once

90
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,960
again.

91
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,210
And look, do an experiment.

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,830
I'm going to do the experiment.

93
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,580
Let the events pan out in front of me, observe, collect information and then theorize, OK.

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,590
So once again, we're going to join Terrence and fill up as they conduct another experiment to dive

95
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:09,080
a bit deeper down the rabbit hole to go deeper into this wacky world of special relativity.

96
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,200
And we're going to see if any kind of strange, interesting phenomena arises to do that.

97
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:16,940
What happens?

98
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,780
Is it up?

99
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,630
They take the rocket ship they bought to conduct their previous experiments and they say, Hey, we

100
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,940
don't need this like clock anymore.

101
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,470
I'm going to throw that out, right?

102
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,290
I'm going to sell it.

103
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,510
And that's going to be money to buy fuel and we're going to do a trip and measure the distance.

104
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:39,500
We're going to travel from Earth to a very distant star, Alpha Centauri, which I'm labeled as a C

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,800
here.

106
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,070
And on that trip, we're going to measure the length that is observed in the moving reference frame.

107
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,890
We're going to compare that to what we know it to be.

108
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,550
OK.

109
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,590
So this is the experiment they're going to conduct.

110
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,830
Let's join and let's figure out what in the world is going on.

111
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,430
OK.

112
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,910
So what we know is that from the Earth reference frame in the rest frame, fill up, who's going to

113
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,080
weigh on the Earth, right?

114
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,270
He looks this up on Google, and he's like, Whew, I know the distance between Earth and Alpha Centauri

115
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,550
that is 4.4 light years.

116
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,230
It's been like that for ages.

117
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,750
It's always been that it's not going to change.

118
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,590
OK.

119
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,280
So Terence, jump in there.

120
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,390
That rocket, take that trip.

121
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,490
And on the journey measured the length.

122
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:23,480
Right?

123
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,240
My everyday life intuition is going to tell me that life has to be the same.

124
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,010
How in the world could life shrink?

125
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,600
How in the world could it change?

126
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,570
Right.

127
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,870
That does not jive with my intuition if it changes.

128
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,600
So if it actually does, that's going to be very interesting.

129
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,560
So what they do is.

130
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:48,390
First of all, they say, OK to make this easy, so the calculations are easy when you're traveling,

131
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,100
I want you to travel at a speed of zero point eight, six seven times the speed of light.

132
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,400
Now we've seen this number previously and this was selected because.

133
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:06,380
Lawrence Factor Gamma, this guy is nothing more than one over the square root of one, minus the relative

134
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,860
velocity of the oversee.

135
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,970
Square and what we find is that if we use the speed zero point eight, six, seven times the speed of

136
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,820
light in this equation, this guy comes out to approximately.

137
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,940
To a factory or two, so that makes the calculations very easy, very straightforward, and it makes

138
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,610
our life easy.

139
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,460
So before the ship goes off, they plan out what's going to go, go on, what's going to happen.

140
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,500
And they say, Wait a second.

141
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:44,480
I know that in my reference frame, Delta X is equal to a v delta t.

142
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,600
It's basic physics, baby physics, well, one, I can calculate the time it's going to take him to

143
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,200
travel.

144
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,810
And then based upon what we have observed previously, our theory of time dilation would state that

145
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,980
Terrence's time is going to be different than the time I calculate, right?

146
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,230
So let's calculate what that's going to be.

147
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,830
Before we start, so they line up and they can communicate along the trip.

148
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,270
OK, so what we do is we say, OK, we know Delta X. We measured that.

149
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,580
We have a very precise number there.

150
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,520
We know BP is going to be the same, right?

151
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,310
We just agreed.

152
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,660
Statement one.

153
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,300
We lost conception of the relative motion.

154
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,680
It's going to be the same as Terrence's concession.

155
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:33,680
It's going to be this point eight, six seven C. All we could just say Delta team is nothing more than

156
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,530
Delta X over V.

157
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,250
So you plug in these guys, we got four point four light years and sometimes in physics, what you do

158
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:49,430
is you put a little C here, multiply by the years that stands four light years.

159
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:59,980
And then the velocity is nothing more than zero point eight, six seven C. So the CS cancel and we find

160
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,230
that Rob's conception of time.

161
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,490
Is nothing more than I look that up in my notes.

162
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,410
That turns out to be five point zero, seven years.

163
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,760
So, Philip, does this any lots of things like, oh, that's not very interesting, that's why he has

164
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,170
a grin on his face over here.

165
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,270
Right, that's that's pretty straightforward.

166
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,820
But what is interesting is going to take a long time for parents to actually fly to Alpha Centauri.

167
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,920
So you might be a little bored, but nothing interesting has really arisen from this analysis yet.

168
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,920
What is interesting?

169
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,270
Is the following.

170
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,500
So in terms this reference frame, which we have on the right.

171
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:58,400
What he sees as he says, you know, Phillips said that Terence is moving at this velocity v, but terrorism

172
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,590
is Oh, wait a minute.

173
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,960
Alpha Centauri is actually moving.

174
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,710
I'm not moving.

175
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,930
I'm standing still, right?

176
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,570
This is the disparity in the asymmetry we discussed previously between the two reference rate.

177
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,870
So he says, wait a second.

178
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,990
Alpha Centauri is coming in my direction.

179
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,100
With this, the speed and the Earth is moving away from me with this speed.

180
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,830
Does OK.

181
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,970
All right.

182
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:30,360
So what we want to do is we want to look at his conception of time and also try and figure out what

183
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:30,690
length.

184
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,250
He gets.

185
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:33,880
All right.

186
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,150
We uncovered this apparent incompatibility inconsistency between these two facts.

187
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:40,900
Right.

188
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,600
They both think the relative motion is B, but population would imply that their conception of time

189
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,170
is different.

190
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,390
There's a different elapse of time between two events taking place, or they would have to apply.

191
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,500
This life is different.

192
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,340
OK.

193
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,110
So before we do that, what I want to do is take a step back and review some important ideas.

194
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,680
So when we talked about time dilation, I mentioned a very important parameter known as proper time.

195
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,820
And what I said is proper time occurs in the reference frame.

196
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:17,070
It's the special designation of time where two events occur in the same place.

197
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,500
So let's back up a little confusing.

198
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,440
Terrance has the proper time because in his reference frame, he's just standing on the rocket ship

199
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,370
and the first event, which is take off that Earth.

200
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,940
And the second event landing on Alpha Centauri.

201
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,250
He hasn't moved, it has occurred in the same place in his reference frame.

202
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:38,820
Right.

203
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:46,500
So the two events are synonymous and we signify that as proper time now, the proper time is always

204
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,920
going to be the reference frame where the time is shortest.

205
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,870
And when you do any kind of problem like this, you want to start off by designating that OK.

206
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,850
So in his reference frame?

207
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,200
The two events are synonymous.

208
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,900
And the time is shorter, it should be shorter, should be shorter, and we can relate it by this relationship

209
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,170
here.

210
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,670
Now, as you can imagine, if we found this discrepancy, there's probably some relativistic phenomenon

211
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,170
that's going to arise related to late.

212
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,810
OK.

213
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:18,430
Right.

214
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:25,690
Spacetime is bending to account for this assertion that the speed of light.

215
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,210
Has to be constant no matter what.

216
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,680
So to compensate for that space, time bends, time may change.

217
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,330
Life may change.

218
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,470
We know the time part we're trying to figure out the life part.

219
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,570
OK, so.

220
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,110
Let's make a special designation between the lines between these guys in case they change, sort of

221
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,800
give it away, right?

222
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,760
Sorry about that.

223
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:55,900
Anyway, jumping back at the problem, what are we going to designate as proper length, the proper

224
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,290
length?

225
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,720
It's going to be defined the same way we define proper time, so proper time.

226
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,030
We sort of used the frame of reference that guide well, our intuition, right?

227
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,220
We said when we time a trip in a car.

228
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,890
We do it with a reference frame that moves with the car, right?

229
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,070
We jump in the car, we have the timer, we go.

230
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,410
We stop it when we get to the destination.

231
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,590
Similarly, when we measure something, the marker, for example, right?

232
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,120
We do it in the reference frame.

233
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,680
That's that rest.

234
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,090
We don't like to move it and then measure it.

235
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,950
We make it stationary and we say there's one event at less than and there's one.

236
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,430
Even at the right hand, we figure out where they're located.

237
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,900
Take the difference and that's the length, right?

238
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,250
So to.

239
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,130
Help this designation jive well with our intuition, what we're going to say is that the proper length

240
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,790
is the length of an object measured in its restaurant, just like we do with things on Earth, just

241
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,870
like we do with things on Earth.

242
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,500
So it's proper because it agrees with our intuition.

243
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,050
So based upon this definition here.

244
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,900
What we're going to find is that the proper length?

245
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:10,870
Well, if we measured the distance from Earth Alpha Centauri, the proper length occurs in the rest

246
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,370
frame when you're not moving.

247
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,070
That would be Philip's interpretation.

248
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,140
So we're going to measure this as proper length and we're going to use the same designation, a knot.

249
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,200
We're going to say this is oh, not right.

250
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,760
So that would mean that Phil Terrence's conception of the length of the trip, we're going to call this

251
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,850
instead of a question mark, just a big help.

252
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,050
Now.

253
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,710
We set up the problem.

254
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:42,180
We got the experiment and play turned to Philip are ready to execute.

255
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,740
What do we need to do?

256
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,550
What do we need to do?

257
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,960
The first thing we need to do is come back to this board and raise some space.

258
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,210
Give us some room to write and explore.

259
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:51,990
Do some physics.

260
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,790
And then when we do that, we're just going to take a look at very simple ideas again, as we found

261
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:06,140
with time dilation, it's a very simple fact and it arises basically from trigonometry, very simple

262
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,590
ideas.

263
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:11,850
But the implications are very complex, convoluted, and that's what can make it confusing sometimes.

264
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:17,990
So what we're gonna do is we'll take the first possible special relativity and that says that the laws

265
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,150
of physics are invariant between reference frames.

266
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:28,490
So that means that, you know, Terrance and Phillip are going to agree that in their space, the velocity

267
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,910
which they have found to be constant, the relative motion between them is constant.

268
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,890
Maybe the way is it is different, right?

269
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,850
Terence, these Alpha Centauri moving to him relapses, Terrance moving away from him.

270
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:46,130
We know that V is just Delta X over Delta T, right?

271
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,110
Basic physics one one.

272
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,700
Nothing surprising.

273
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,810
So they can both do that physical principle of physical law, and it will be true in their reference

274
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,140
frame.

275
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,270
Right, that's the first possible special relativity.

276
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,920
So Philip could say, you could say, Oh, OK, I can measure that velocity.

277
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,800
That's that's not very interesting.

278
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,380
That's Elmont over.

279
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,570
Delta T, but wait a minute.

280
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,920
Terrorists could say.

281
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,790
You know, Amanda's now, right?

282
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,870
That's not right.

283
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,330
It's actually 11.15am, right, I measure time differently.

284
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:31,220
Time progresses in a different manner in my reference frame, so you know, there might be differences.

285
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,330
Little weird, little we're but we they both agree that we is confident.

286
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,950
So before we do this?

287
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,450
Parents could say, like what we're just talking about, you say, hey, we know that time dilation

288
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,860
says Delta T is gamma delta t.

289
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,660
Not so.

290
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,520
I mean, if you calculate at the time, it's going to say for me, I know that I should contact you

291
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:06,520
after the following, we take Delta T not set that equal to Delta T over gamma and then we just plug

292
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,210
in your baby.

293
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,200
So this is five point, oh, seven years.

294
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,940
And we divide by that noise factor, and that's why we chose the speed divide by two.

295
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:27,380
Well, we end up with is I believe that's 2.5 three or four, and I check my notes.

296
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,930
I put down 2.5 for.

297
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,110
All right, so his time is different.

298
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,600
And thanks to their work previously, they're able to figure out what time they should contact each

299
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,680
other, right?

300
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,480
It's off by a factor of two.

301
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:56,620
But this that is what gives rise to a new phenomenon, a new interesting fact that we're studying right

302
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,640
now because.

303
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,390
If this is constant.

304
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,970
And that guy and that guy are different.

305
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,360
Then these guys also must be different.

306
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,920
Let's back up a bit.

307
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,120
I want you guys to understand that, OK, that's a very important application.

308
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:16,830
OK.

309
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,940
These quantities, this quantity is the same as this quantity.

310
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,470
So this is different than this in order for them to be equal in order to assert this fact, which Terrance

311
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,600
and Phillip both agree on this life must be different than that length.

312
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,640
Well, wait a second.

313
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,870
How could the length be different?

314
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,690
That's just what it is that special relativity forks.

315
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:49,420
So what we could do is we can go boom and we can say, Hey, I know this relationship here.

316
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:57,040
Delta T over Delta T, not that's nothing more than gamma.

317
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,170
Let me make use of this.

318
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:10,120
This result, so we could say, well, not overall is equal to Delta T over Delta T not.

319
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,420
All right.

320
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,970
And this is going to be equal to gamma.

321
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,500
All right.

322
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:26,720
So what we find is that if we isolate the new life we're trying to find right here, multiply and multiply

323
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,750
all over here, divide by the gamma, we find that.

324
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:36,190
L equals L Mart over drama.

325
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,590
Whoa, wait a second.

326
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,960
The two legs are not the same.

327
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,600
They do not equal.

328
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,760
So you should be scratching your head like, whoa.

329
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,760
So what exactly happens?

330
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,250
Let's explore this a bit further and try to understand it.

331
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,720
Try to extract the information that we have gathered from the universe.

332
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,530
Let the universe dictate how things behave, and let's interpret that.

333
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,020
So what we find here is that we have a phenomenon where.

334
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:16,240
The proper length is being contracted, it's getting smaller, so the length, according to somebody

335
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
moving is always going to be smaller, right?

336
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,130
So this we call it length contraction.

337
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,750
That's the formal name.

338
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,020
And another way of thinking about this.

339
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,640
Is the following.

340
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,740
The implied effect.

341
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,590
Of life contraction.

342
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,800
Is that?

343
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,760
A moving.

344
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,150
Body.

345
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,400
I've observed.

346
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:18,940
To be contracted.

347
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,490
There to get smaller, so the light.

348
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:32,150
Shrinks, it gets smaller, and yes, this is not a fictional phenomenon that's rising, this is a true

349
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,630
effect.

350
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:36,470
Just like time dilation, something that you will actually observe.

351
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,550
Somebody who's moving is going to see this distance shrink.

352
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,600
It's going to be smaller.

353
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,470
This is a realized fact and it's something we have discovered.

354
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,730
We have verified evidence of lab experiments multiple and multiple times.

355
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,460
This is a real effect.

356
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,780
This is reality.

357
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:54,980
This is the universe.

358
00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:01,640
So when Terence is flying to Alpha Centauri, what does this thought experiment?

359
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,380
And he's like, Whoa, man, that's why his mouth is wide open right there with this result right there.

360
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,670
And he's freaking out because his conception of space is not correct.

361
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,770
Just like his old conception of time, and maybe he might get a Nobel Laureate Prize because of this.

362
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:27,080
So he's freaking out, but he's saying Terrence is going to report a different length, and he's right.

363
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,990
So we could technically calculate this by saying, Well, the length is just going to be the following.

364
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,550
So this light that's going to come out to be two point two.

365
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,250
Light years.

366
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,300
And what I want to make note of is this should not be surprising, right?

367
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,100
This is a weird effect, very wacky effect.

368
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,500
But if you look at what's in front of us, it, it just falls right out of the map, falls right out

369
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,600
of the physics, falls right out of the experiment.

370
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,410
Because look, if Terence is going at a velocity of B.

371
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:09,040
And his time is shorter than the elapsed time is shorter than what he had, and of course, he has to

372
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,040
travel the same amount of length, right?

373
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,640
Because.

374
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:19,040
At the end, he's going to be at Alpha Centauri, and they both agree about that event, that at the

375
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,660
end they're at Alpha Centauri.

376
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,100
But in order to make that happen with the same velocity here.

377
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,820
This has to be shorter.

378
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,110
Right.

379
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:34,550
This has to be shorter, otherwise his velocity would have to speed up to go that same exact distance.

380
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:34,870
Right?

381
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:43,870
So as you can see, again, just just as we have observed with time dilation space, time is bending

382
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:52,030
to compensate and exert the fact that the speed of light is always constant and that that fact is consistent

383
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,610
between reference frames.

384
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,580
Now let's dive a bit further down the rabbit hole.

385
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,880
What we observe with time dilation that this phenomenon is sort of asymmetrical.

386
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,940
We're going to see the same exact idea crop up.

387
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,760
OK, so you want to think of life contraction like this?

388
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,980
It's very slim at a time dilation, and they're connected, as we can see through this equation here.

389
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,140
But it's sort of like the opposite effect.

390
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,080
Let's explore this asymmetry.

391
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,950
So in this situation?

392
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:32,890
Parents, this conception of the life it's contracted because he's it's moving in his reverence for

393
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,880
him and his reference frame.

394
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,680
This is moving towards him.

395
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,420
OK, now.

396
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:45,430
We could also explore the alternate situation we can say, Terrence, are you seeing right here?

397
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,370
He's super bored, so maybe he maybe he has like a TV in here with him.

398
00:26:54,030 --> 00:27:00,390
So he's watching TV and here when he's he's going out, S.R., he has to weigh 2.2 or rather 2.5 four

399
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,460
years to actually get to his end destination.

400
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,050
That's why he's super bored in that picture.

401
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,460
So he could have this and you can say, Hey, man, I have some length here.

402
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:17,490
But in this situation, this becomes the proper length because if we measure it in a moving spaceship,

403
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:23,670
in the spaceship, that's when it is at rest for the person in the spaceship, in the prime reference

404
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:23,970
frame.

405
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:31,560
So you may see this is Elmont, but to fill up, if he observed a themed television that's moving for

406
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,030
him, the length would be contracted, Rick.

407
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:41,670
So it's an asymmetrical effect where you know the opposite has a different the opposite reference frame

408
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,510
has a different conception of the length of space.

409
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,310
But if you flip it around, that same effect can apply, OK?

410
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,230
And the symmetrical nature of it comes from the proper length.

411
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,280
OK.
