1
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.810
To get a better understanding of this.

2
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.290
What we want to do is take a look at the same situation, Wolf, with some slight modifications.

3
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.350
OK, this is weird, and this is sort of a similar odd contradicting effect that we serve a time dilation

4
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.850
with the twin paradox.

5
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.590
But we can resolve it.

6
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.130
OK.

7
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.170
And it's possible for Philip and Terence to have conflicting opinions that are correct that are correct.

8
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.130
Whoa.

9
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.240
Sounds weird.

10
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.920
Calm down.

11
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.560
We're going to fix it, OK, so what we're going to do is we're going to take the same situation here.

12
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.030
And we're going to say that there are two events.

13
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.640
There is an event that occurs right here, we'll call events one.

14
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.700
And there's going to be event that occurs right here.

15
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.970
We'll call that event too.

16
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.260
We're going to stipulate that as this train flies through this tunnel.

17
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.960
We're going to send gates that close the tunnel quickly and then open again, and then it flies through.

18
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.420
So terrorists is going to go a bit faster than point nine three three C..

19
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.580
To amplify this length contraction, so he's smaller than 20 feet so he can fit in there.

20
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.390
And when he is inside the tunnel boom events one and two are simultaneously and that's a key work you've

21
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:57.580
got in the back of your head south, famously going to shut up and then open or closed.

22
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.970
No, nope.

23
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.330
And according to Philip, he's like, That's no problem, because as it goes through the tunnel, that

24
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.770
door is going to go up.

25
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.360
He's going to fit inside the tunnel.

26
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.300
It's going to go open and then it's going to fly through it.

27
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.170
OK.

28
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.050
But according to terrorists, he's highly conflicted.

29
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.200
He's highly conflicted because what he says is there's no way I can fit inside of this thought on the

30
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.920
doors close.

31
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.020
It's literally going to cut my car in half.

32
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.820
OK.

33
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.500
So to summarize and give you a graphical representation of the dilemma that we're trying to resolve

34
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.680
here, I'm going to draw another picture.

35
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.100
OK.

36
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.770
So for Terence?

37
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.750
If he has his little box car here with the big wheels, because I'm such a great artist, such a great

38
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.170
artist.

39
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.030
What he's going to observe, or rather what Philip is going to observe, is that at some point there's

40
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.930
going to be a tunnel

41
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.290
which encapsulates this.

42
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.230
This is going to be P's interpretation.

43
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.370
But in terms reference frame, there's no way this can fit in there.

44
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.540
So what's going to happen is when the sky closes, it's going to look maybe something like this where

45
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.680
it closes and it cuts off the two ends of its box cutter.

46
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.110
Who's right?

47
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.540
Well, as I just said, they're both right.

48
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.700
Let's resolve this dilemma.

49
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.050
That dilemma is what Einstein actually brought up in one of his good, his German thought experiments.

50
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.350
And he called this the train paradox.

51
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.430
Let's resolve.

52
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.860
He's all this.

53
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.870
What we need to take a look at is another relativistic effect that Einstein actually talked about,

54
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.940
and what he said is that the simultaneity of events is relative and not absolute.

55
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.770
I'm going to see that again, the simultaneity of events is relative, but not absolute.

56
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.650
What world did I just say?

57
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.520
Simultaneity?

58
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.210
That's a big word.

59
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.290
Let's break it down.

60
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.290
I like using linguistics to convey the meaning of words and phenomena right in physics.

61
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.240
We generally take a concept, an idea, a word, and that word.

62
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.510
The linguistics behind it expressed the phenomenon.

63
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.650
It brings it to life.

64
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:32.680
So simultaneity, as it implies from the root word simultaneous, means that events occur at the same

65
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.940
exact time.

66
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.450
So Philip was standing here right in everyday situations if these closed at the same time.

67
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.740
Right.

68
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.890
It's pretty easy to to assert that Philip would see the gates closing at the same time.

69
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.790
That's not surprising.

70
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.300
But what we need to understand is that our experience of life of the universe is nothing more than our

71
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.650
perception of the events that are transpiring in front of us, right?

72
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.890
It's contingent upon or dependent upon our perspective of the world around us, right?

73
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.540
Depending upon how we collect information about events transpiring in front of us that dictates the

74
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.670
experience we're going to hold, right?

75
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.530
So if we receive different information, different sets of facts in our perspective, right?

76
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.110
It will look like those events transpired in a different way than somebody else who may be collecting

77
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.310
different information, right?

78
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.720
This is not surprising.

79
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.890
This happens in physics.

80
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.860
This is what we're studying in terms of relativity with time dilation, where time the the way in which

81
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.720
it's it, it arises, the way in which we experience that it's contingent upon what reference we were

82
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.310
in when information we obtained.

83
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.930
We see that with length contraction, where they're both collecting different information, terrorism

84
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:52.350
fill up.

85
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.810
And because of that, different phenomena of life contraction occur, right?

86
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:08.490
But that information we we achieve, the information we receive, right, depending upon the motion

87
00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.430
which it comes in and the times in which it comes in.

88
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.340
That's going to dictate the situation that arise.

89
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.970
So let's take a step back and let's dive a bit more into this.

90
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.360
OK.

91
00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:27.540
So when an event occurs, when it transpires in front of us, if we're talking about the observation

92
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.330
of that event, the information that is conveyed to us is the light that is coming back right.

93
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.080
If I take this marker and I drop it in the event of it hitting the floor and the event of you seeing

94
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.980
it, that is marked by light hitting the marker or reflecting off of it and going back into my eyes.

95
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.800
And that conveys the experience, the hand that conveys and illustrates the situation in front of me.

96
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.620
So in everyday situations?

97
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.370
Right.

98
00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:04.080
This is something we don't really take a closer look at because light travels so fast that if you have

99
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.240
relative motion and you're moving the distance, that light coming into this, if you're moving in this,

100
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.150
this direction, the light coming in here, right?

101
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.860
That's going to minimize the distance that might have to travel, and it's going to increase the distance

102
00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.360
the light has to travel from back here.

103
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.460
But at small velocities, right, that is sort of negligible, right?

104
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.360
Because the light is traveling so fast.

105
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:31.650
But as we start traveling closer to the speed of light, what's going to happen is that that distance

106
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.870
that you travel relative to the light coming in is going to make a big difference.

107
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:43.080
So it may appear in an everyday life situation where there's discrepancies don't pop up, where it's,

108
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.120
you know, it's negligible that distance that it may look like an event occurs at the same time.

109
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:56.220
But in your reality, in your relative motion, right when you're moving in a reference frame, it may

110
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:02.700
look as though you receive certain information before other information and one event may appear to

111
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.410
occur before another event.

112
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.190
Let's illustrate that let's draw it up, and let's take a closer look at that.

113
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:08.820
OK.

114
00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:18.360
So what I'm talking about is if we take Terrence's reference there, if we take this guy and we have

115
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.780
a boxcar as such, it's traveling at a velocity of close to the speed of light.

116
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.750
And we have a gate here and a gate here.

117
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.790
All through all the tracks.

118
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.980
So this guy, these guys appear to come up at the same time.

119
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.330
The information has to travel to parents.

120
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:47.470
Here before that event can transpire in his reference frame, so we may have some little light coming

121
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.040
over here.

122
00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.960
It's going at the speed, see?

123
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.760
So if this travels?

124
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.390
In Delta T, when it's going to do is, it's going to travel, let's say.

125
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.080
A distance.

126
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:12.500
Typically, the reality right now is using basic kinematics, yup, x is equal to fidelity.

127
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.160
So.

128
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:21.220
The distance that this plane has to travel to get to the front of the box car is.

129
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.730
Decreased by this amount.

130
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.350
We're on the back end.

131
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.390
This guy, what it has to travel is an additional.

132
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.080
Distance because this traveled.

133
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.020
In this direction.

134
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.810
V Delta T also.

135
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.610
And has to travel.

136
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:47.260
Plus.

137
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:49.760
V Delta T.

138
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:56.150
OK, so back here, what it has to travel is this distance, this distance.

139
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.980
In order for terrorists to see it, we're assuming that this is the distance between these are negligibly

140
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.520
negligibly small.

141
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.480
Rather, we could extend this out to get the terrorists OK.

142
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:15.550
Apparently, that's a better way to do so, the distance this information has to travel.

143
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:26.110
It's going to be C T minus B and T is the time in which for this this guy, it takes for that to reach

144
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:26.230
it.

145
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:29.100
But on this end.

146
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.440
This is it has to travel.

147
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.680
And we're going to soon he stands in the middle.

148
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.390
We don't want any discrepancies where, oh, he's in the front of the boxcars, so it takes longer to

149
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:43.630
see that we're we're doing the distances are equal initially.

150
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.340
OK, no discapacidad.

151
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.750
So what this information this information has to travel a distance to see.

152
00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:01.980
Plus, Viti and I'm separating the times because what I'm going to say is that this distance is going

153
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.130
to be smaller because of the relative motion that has to travel.

154
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.190
So T1 is going to be smaller than T2.

155
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.800
And in this reference frame?

156
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.880
What he is going to see is that when he's traveling into this guy.

157
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.050
His boxcar.

158
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.270
It's going to be maybe right about here.

159
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.040
I can draw a picture for you guys.

160
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.420
Well, he's going to see is his boxcar.

161
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.020
You're going to be.

162
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.500
We'll see say this is.

163
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.190
As such, it's going to be the tunnel when his box car is right here.

164
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:52.170
That, too, is going to transpire because he sees it first, because it takes less time for him to

165
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.100
observe that event.

166
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.320
So this is going to close, it's going to go up.

167
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.790
And then it's going to open right away.

168
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.070
And then at a separate time.

169
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.290
Something that looks like this.

170
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.440
This is going to go up, and he's going to see it go up.

171
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.290
OK.

172
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:25.830
So according to Terrence, his experience of the universe, which is not absolute.

173
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.620
He's going to say Event two occurs first and then event one occurs because I'm moving close to the speed

174
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.040
of light.

175
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.640
So if I'm moving towards event one, that information reaches me first.

176
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.070
And then the information can me that one reaches me so that a second.

177
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.040
And he's right, he's right.

178
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.900
That's what happens in his reference frame.

179
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:57.570
But in Phillip's situation, the light is traveling so fast that any discrepancies between the distance

180
00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.320
between them, he cannot actually see that in everyday life.

181
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.820
Or you can make it simpler.

182
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.440
You can say he stands right here in the middle.

183
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.600
So it's the same exact distance.

184
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.470
And what he sees is that the words go up and they come down.

185
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:17.730
But you you will have to agree that if fill up does not see it, a train gets sliced in half.

186
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:23.940
Then, in Terrence's reference frame, there's no way it can get sliced in half because you would have

187
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.290
to see the parts fall off.

188
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.750
And this is what is happening.

189
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.830
This is what explains it.

190
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:34.620
This says that, according to Philip, it looks like this shrinks and it gets in the tunnel.

191
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.950
And he's right.

192
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.500
It can fit in the tunnel.

193
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.240
But according to Terrence.

194
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.270
This tunnel looks like it shrinks, and there's no way you can fit inside the tunnel.

195
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.920
And he's right.

196
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.330
But when they're inside of the tunnel, when it closes.

197
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.980
The simultaneity of events.

198
00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.980
Or rather, the fact that the simultaneity of events is relative.

199
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.760
Philip is going to say the tours are going to close when he's inside of it, and he's right, and Terence

200
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.050
is going to say that this guy is going to close for us, it's like a come off, it's going to open,

201
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.070
he's going to fly through.

202
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.240
And then when he's about to exit the tunnel, when he's he, he's.

203
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.420
Going in in the backside in this part, here is that one, it's going to go up.

204
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.960
It's not going to slice them in half and then it's going to fly out.

205
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:32.560
And in that situation, what they agree on is that the train goes through the tunnel.

206
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:40.930
It does not get sliced, but they have different interpretations of the events that transpired blocks

207
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:42.760
that special relativity.

208
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.750
It's a weird.

209
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.140
It's contradicted.

210
00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:53.470
But it's a way for bridging the gap between two individuals where they experience different situations.

211
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.230
But they can still talk about it.

212
00:14:56.590 --> 00:15:05.800
And the ultimate, I guess, transpiration of events in their situations line up and they can agree

213
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.290
on some facts.

214
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.480
They have a universal conception of reality.

215
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:16.480
They can communicate about what's going on, and that is what is special about special relativity.

216
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:25.600
Her little upon that is special because it allows any individual to experience the universe, but also

217
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.060
convey that in a way that somebody else can understand and make sense of, OK.

218
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.180
So that's length contraction.

219
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:43.000
What we've observed up to now is that length, contraction and time dilation are very weird, very weird

220
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:49.600
situations to prop up that don't normally happen in an everyday life situation here on Earth, in a

221
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.620
sense that we can have two true statements that contradict each other.

222
00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.400
But they're still right, and they can still agree on that situation by taking a look at different little

223
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:06.620
idiosyncrasies associated with the events that transpire in both reference.

224
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.670
OK, so we observed all these weird ideas.

225
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:17.080
We've got this nice foundation for putting together a bridge, for making that nice universal conception

226
00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:17.890
of reality.

227
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.230
Bridging these two different interpretations of the universe.

228
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:27.120
What we want to do is we want to finish paving that bridge.

229
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:31.320
You want to use the foundation and put together and finalize that bridge.

230
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:37.090
So in the next video, what we're going to talk about is something known as a Lorentz transformation,

231
00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:42.730
and that's going to be sort of the analog of what we used in the beginning of the course with the Galilean

232
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:49.480
transformation that was used without taking account of special relativistic effects.

233
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:56.530
OK, so we're going to have a blueprint, a map that dictates if Philip wants to translate his experience

234
00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:03.460
and appearances, he can have this map, this formula you can follow, and Terence can do the same thing.

235
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.430
I hope you enjoyed this weird experience.

236
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:14.020
I hope you enjoy this mind boggling situation that really challenge you and help you better understand

237
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.280
length contraction.

238
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.300
And I look forward to talking about the Lorenz transformation next.

239
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.140
Stay tuned.
