1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:24,200
All right, in our last lesson, we go a bit further down the wacky world of special relativity and

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,210
we learn about a new relativistic effect known as length contraction.

3
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,500
What do we find out?

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,210
We discovered that a moving body is observed to be contracted, that in a rest frame.

5
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:46,220
If we observe an entity that's moving any kind of length in that reference frame will appear to be shortened.

6
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,180
OK, so this is known as length contraction and compared to our everyday experience of length of things

7
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:57,240
in the world, in the universe, this idea was very weird.

8
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,110
It was very contrary to how we would experience things.

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:07,640
We in general, we we feel like the length or the way which measure the length of an object should not

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,610
change if there's any relative motion between the two.

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,600
OK, so this implied effect of life contraction is weird in and of itself.

12
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,920
So what I want to do in this video is run through a quick example with you.

13
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,010
I'm holding your hand.

14
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,090
Help you to build up intuition with this weird effect so you can understand it.

15
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:31,460
And then I'll unleash you to do your own kind of problems by yourself to learn independently.

16
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,120
In this video, we're going to run through an example, and it's going to divulge a very weird effect

17
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,100
that arises as a result of length contraction, right?

18
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,120
As we have seen in previous lessons, previous effects we've uncovered, right?

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,290
It may arise some weird relativistic effect, but if you dive further down into the rabbit hole, it

20
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,270
just gets weirder and weirder and weirder.

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,010
OK, so we're going to make things strange or we're going to challenge your interpretation of this idea,

22
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:08,390
challenge your conception of the universe and open your eyes to what is actually happening at relativistic

23
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:08,870
speeds.

24
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:14,690
OK, so the problem we're going to take a look at is the following OK, we're going to have terrorism

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,080
fill up.

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
They're going to do a new experiment.

27
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,980
They discover this weird effects that they want to build intuition with it, with you.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,370
Two.

29
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:30,440
So what they do is they buy a standard box car, which has a length of fifty five point four two feet

30
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,180
and that was looked up by standard manufacturers of box cars.

31
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,700
And what they're going to do is Terence, he says, OK, I'm going to travel up some speed and I'm going

32
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,590
to travel into this tunnel.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,020
The question is, if Philip, you're observing this on Earth, how fast do I have to travel such that

34
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,140
my life, according to you, is contracted is shortened so that this tunnel can encapsulate my life

35
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,270
so that I can shrink to such an amount that I fit inside this tunnel, OK?

36
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,220
So the problem statement officially says the pose that a standard boxcar of life 55 point forty two

37
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,910
feet is about to travel through a tunnel of like 20 feet.

38
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,720
So this guy 20 feet, how fast must it travel?

39
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,730
Such an observer sees the train fit inside the tunnel.

40
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,940
OK, so what have you kind of problems and special relativity?

41
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,900
The first thing you want to do is get your bearings straight.

42
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,770
OK, what is the proper length?

43
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,330
What is the proper time?

44
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,910
OK, so first and foremost, what we're dealing with here is length contraction.

45
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:40,870
We're going to focus on the mike, but it might be a valuable exercise to also identify the proper time.

46
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:49,070
So what we learned in the last video is that the proper length is the length of which it's the reference

47
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,090
frame where measuring the length of something jives, well, her intuition, right?

48
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,280
And that occurs in the rest frame, right?

49
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,190
When we measure something generally, we don't move it.

50
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,590
We keep it stationary.

51
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,480
We figure out the left and the right side and then we measure it.

52
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,040
And that occurs in a rest frame.

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,300
That's the best way to do it.

54
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,420
That's how we do it in everyday life situations.

55
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:18,830
So what we found is that the proper length is defined as the reference frame where the object is stationary.

56
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:25,250
OK, and then life gets contract in the reference frame, where that object is moving relative to the

57
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,820
rest room.

58
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,720
So what situation implies that the life of this guy is stationary?

59
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,400
Well, or rather at rest, well in is frame.

60
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:46,130
What he sees is he's in the car and he does not think that the boxcar is moving at all because he's

61
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,840
moving at the same speed as the boxcar.

62
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,800
What he sees is it looks like the tunnel is moving towards him.

63
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:59,270
So in his reference frame, the length of the boxcar is at rest and he would measure it just as we do

64
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,370
in any kind of everyday situation, right?

65
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,010
You pull out that measuring tape, figure out the left side, figure out the right side and measure

66
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,190
it.

67
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:15,470
So based upon that, that I guess interpretation of what's going on, we would say the proper length

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,500
would be intact.

69
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,880
This is a reference frame right there, so I'm going to put that element right there.

70
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,000
We know that in his reference frame, the car fifty five point four two feet is not going to change.

71
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,560
So this is going to be fifty five point four two feet now if we're doing things related to time.

72
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:43,300
We would also want to measure the proper, yeah, the proper time.

73
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,750
OK.

74
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,300
In this situation, we're going to skip that.

75
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:46,630
OK.

76
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,270
So this is the proper light, according to Terrence.

77
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:58,890
So Philip is going to see a contract at length, and we want to specify the philosophy it takes for

78
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,160
this guy to look like it contracted to fit inside this guy.

79
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:02,820
But.

80
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,680
Just taking the life right here, we know that this guy is going to be 20 feet.

81
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,110
That's what it is, regardless of a reference frame.

82
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,870
And we need to figure out the velocity that Terrence has to travel.

83
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,720
What should he set the car to travel, such as it looks like to him that it fits inside this tunnel?

84
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,260
OK, so we can do that by taking advantage of what we just arrived our life contraction formula so we

85
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,940
could take L is equal to L not.

86
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,870
Over.

87
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,800
Gamma, and I'm going to back up a bit here.

88
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:44,510
I want to specify this as well is the length time that we want this guy to shrink to, OK?

89
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,600
Because remember, this is the proper length it's going to be shaped by this shrunk by this Lorentz

90
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,110
factor.

91
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,610
And then it's going to be that we want this to be the same life as this guy.

92
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,290
OK, so we know these parameters.

93
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,790
We know Elmo, and we know.

94
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,080
OK, so let's factor we know is one over the square root of one, minus the relativistic velocity PETA

95
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,590
squared.

96
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,490
So if we divide by this, the radical flips up.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:20,360
So this just becomes nothing more than Elmont times the square root of one minus theta square.

98
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:27,290
So if we want to solve for the velocity we need to solve for beta, because remember, theta is the

99
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,670
relativistic velocity.

100
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,640
It's just B over C.

101
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,360
All right.

102
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,830
So how can we do this?

103
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,160
What we could do is we could square both sides.

104
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:41,420
We can get el squared is equal to Elmont squared.

105
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,220
Times one minus beta squared.

106
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,980
And then we could divide this guy over there to get.

107
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,830
Elsewhere over Elmont Square.

108
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,720
And.

109
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,010
We accept set that equal to one minus beta square.

110
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,090
Now what we could do is we could add the beta squared over here.

111
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,250
Move this guy over there by subtracting it, and then we could take the square root.

112
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,780
So I'll do it in a criminal statute.

113
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,850
Make sure you guys are following along with me.

114
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:29,670
So data comes over here, we get the data squared and then we get a one minus L over L not.

115
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,950
And I'm going to write it as such, right?

116
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,000
Because if we write as such, the square applies to both terms.

117
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,190
And all we have left to do is just to say well.

118
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,030
Data.

119
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:52,770
The square root is equal to the square root of one minus L or El Norte.

120
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,460
And then we square the sky.

121
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,050
So with this guy, we can use this to figure out, well, the relativistic velocity.

122
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,240
That's let's be pretty straightforward.

123
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,410
So that's going to be just multiplied by C. We take better multiply by C.

124
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,750
And we get one minus L.

125
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:20,720
Over Elmont, this guy squared and multiply it by a factor of C.

126
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,910
OK, so what we could do?

127
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,010
What's left is we just plug and chug, plug in the parameters we've identified, and that's why it's

128
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,320
important to identify the proper length.

129
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,700
Just plug it in there.

130
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,990
And that will tell us how fast tenants will have to travel to shrink to the size of that tunnel.

131
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,650
OK.

132
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,270
So if I check my notes, we got the same exact result.

133
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,380
So that's good.

134
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,080
And what we need to do is we need to just plug it shocks.

135
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,790
Let's do that.

136
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,210
So we write the square root.

137
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,950
We put one minus.

138
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,510
We want the Lincoln Tunnel right here as identified 20 feet.

139
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,770
Over the proper length of 55 point four.

140
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,710
And we want to square these guys and then multiply by 50.

141
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:21,850
So if we whip out to 83 and plot these numbers straight in, we plug and chug chug along.

142
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:34,190
We find that the train will have to chug along at a value of zero point nine three three times the speed

143
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,760
of light.

144
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,350
OK, so.

145
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:44,540
It's not surprising that we have to go close to the speed of light because relativistic effects such

146
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,750
as length, contraction and time dilation.

147
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,630
Occur when we're traveling close to the speed of light.

148
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,490
OK, so this says and this is a remarkable feature, remarkable fact.

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,470
This is verifiable.

150
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,730
This is exactly what we would observe in real life if this actually happened.

151
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:10,720
But what we find is that if parents travels at a velocity of zero point nine three three times the speed

152
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,070
of light to fill up, it's going to look as though this guide short shrinks down to the size of this

153
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:18,560
tunnel.

154
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,770
And it will fit inside of the tunnel.

155
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,820
Whoa.

156
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,890
That's a crazy, crazy idea, right?

157
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:32,710
So that really takes a slap in the face of our intuition, of our everyday conception of reality.

158
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,150
OK.

159
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,080
But we've sort of seen that.

160
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,380
So it's not a surprising this is what we would have expected.

161
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,140
But as I said in the beginning of the year, we're going to dive a bit deeper.

162
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,520
OK.

163
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,870
So fill up.

164
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,950
This conception of what would happen here is correct.

165
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,410
Let's take a deeper look at what Terrence is going to observe.

166
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,090
What is he going to observe?

167
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:03,490
So for him in his situation, as I said, it looks like the train is stationary and both fill up and

168
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,560
the tunnel are going to be moving towards him.

169
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:14,380
So as I mentioned in the last video, there's an inherent asymmetry that is built into this effect,

170
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:14,710
right?

171
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:24,680
He may see a life contraction fill up, that is, but Terrence may also observe a life contraction,

172
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,050
and they're both right.

173
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,260
They're both right.

174
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,580
Right.

175
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:36,980
Because your experience of the universe is nothing more than your perspective than the way in which

176
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,410
you perceive events transpiring in front of you.

177
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:48,050
So, according to Terrence, if it looks like this is moving well, you know, the applied effect of

178
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,730
life contraction is that a moving body is observed to contract.

179
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,560
So to him.

180
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,800
It will look as though the title contracts, even though to fill up, that does not contract.

181
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,500
And he's right, he's right.

182
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:06,340
So that's what I feel sort of scratching his head.

183
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,690
He's like, Yo, Terrence, what are you talking about, man?

184
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,250
That makes no sense.

185
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,060
I don't observe that.

186
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:11,960
You're crazy, bro.

187
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,200
So let's take a deeper look at this.

188
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,500
So according to him, what he's going to say is.

189
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:27,830
Fill up, you know, this is stationary and his reference frame, so now according to fill up, this

190
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,850
is the proper length.

191
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,690
And the life he measures is going to be.

192
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:39,950
And then it becomes L, it becomes L, so again, the implied effect is that a moving body is observed

193
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,000
to be contracted.

194
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,440
So he's less moving.

195
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,670
It has to get smaller.

196
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,110
Let's calculate what that would have to be.

197
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,930
So we just use the same exact formula.

198
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,060
These guys are just sort of flipped.

199
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:54,590
So according to two, I'll put a little line there, according to Terrence.

200
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,800
He's going to say the length of the tunnel is going to be contracted as such.

201
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,550
OK.

202
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,640
So what we could do is, you know.

203
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:16,460
The Lorentz factor, the square root pops up, we get nothing more than Elmont and the square root of

204
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,610
one minus B the squared.

205
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,580
You know, PETA is no more than point ninety three million plug in show up.

206
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:26,600
So.

207
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,970
In this case, the proper length is going to be the 20.

208
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:41,840
So we get 20 feet times the square root of one minus zero point nine three three.

209
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,060
Quantity squared

210
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,040
and that's going to be equal to wait for this.

211
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,820
Wait for it.

212
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,570
Wait for it.

213
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,150
Three six feet.

214
00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:01,280
That's right, it gets contracted to two point three six feet.

215
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,090
Wait a minute.

216
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:15,350
If Phillips says that this guy is going to shrink down to a size, that's 20 feet.

217
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,070
And he's got to feet in the tunnel.

218
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,850
But Terrence says that the tunnel is going to shrink from 20 feet to two point three six feet.

219
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,920
And according to him, the length of his car, which is fifty five point four two feet.

220
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,390
There's no way it could fit inside of this.

221
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,790
Well, what's going on?

222
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,390
According to Einstein Phillips, right?

223
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,250
Terrence is right to.

224
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,200
You want to scratch your head, like fill up.

225
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,450
How can they both be right when their conclusions contradict each other?

226
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,800
What's going on here?

227
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,150
What's going on here?
