1
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.690
All right.

2
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.530
At this point, we've got this nice universal conception of the universe, we're using the virus transformation.

3
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.790
What I want to do is run through a quick example to demonstrate the power that this provides and translating

4
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.500
between two different reference frames.

5
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.330
How helps to explain things?

6
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.110
Well, which I'm going to do that is I'm going to hearken back to the example we used previously to

7
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.000
help you understand life contraction.

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.010
That was the example which I labeled as Einstein's train paradox.

9
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.620
This situation was occurring in which Terence was in a train.

10
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.500
He was flying to the right at a speed, and we were trying to figure out the velocity he had to travel

11
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.010
such that wheel up when he's encountered with a tunnel that is a length of 20 feet.

12
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.360
He goes so fast that the length contracts and it appears as though Tarrant's fits inside that tunnel.

13
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.960
Now, as I was running through that problem, we encountered that they disagreed on how things would

14
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.030
happen, and we have found that it was resolved by stating that the simultaneity of events is relative,

15
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.530
not absolute.

16
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.460
In other words, the way in which events unravel in front of somebody is unique to to their experience,

17
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.990
the way in which they experience the universe and the way in which it transpires.

18
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.750
So what we found is that fill up may state that when you have gates that fly up on both ends, that

19
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.780
can occur at the same time simultaneously.

20
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.360
However, in Terrence's reference frame, what I stated is that the right side closes.

21
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.180
First, it opens, he flies through and then the left side closes and it's OK.

22
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.230
He doesn't get sliced.

23
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.270
Everything is all well.

24
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.730
Now, if we take the Lorentz transformation, I can prove that for you, right?

25
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.510
When I stated it, I did not give very hard evidence.

26
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.040
A lot of math, a lot of physics.

27
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.990
I just stated, that's the concept.

28
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.250
That's how it is.

29
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.580
Let's use our new tool, our new baby, the lines for transformation and use it to prove that what I

30
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.270
told you is in fact valid is in fact true.

31
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.310
I'm pulling a fast one on you, not lying.

32
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.180
I'm telling the truth.

33
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.900
Let's understand what's going on a bit better in this problem.

34
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.380
OK.

35
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.990
So to do that, what we need to do is record the information we do have and to refresh your memory.

36
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.840
What I want to say is that we've got a lot.

37
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.840
It had to travel about zero point nine three three times speed of light in order to shrink down from

38
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.740
fifty five point four two feet down to.

39
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.390
The length of this tunnel, so it would fit inside of it, according to Philip.

40
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.270
OK from his possession.

41
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.680
OK, so.

42
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.620
Using this value, we can derive the Lorentz factor, which we did in that previous video, we showed

43
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.830
that it was nothing more than.

44
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.180
Again, I was doing L is equal to L not over gamma.

45
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.330
We take L not 55 or 42, divided by 20.

46
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.660
That gives us a factor of two point seventy seven one.

47
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.770
It's quite large, but not as large as some of the values we've seen previously, right?

48
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.280
With the mu on example, it was quite large greater than like 100.

49
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.010
That was quite a large guy.

50
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.150
So what happens is in Philip's reference frame in the s, the unauthorized reference frame, no prime

51
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:50.260
event, one an event to occur at the same time, we'll set that equal to time equal zero.

52
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.290
So T one is equal to zero one event.

53
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.830
One on the left side goes up that occurs at the left side.

54
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.330
I'm going to say we're going to a reference frame in his wrap in his his perception x y that's embedded

55
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.050
on the left side of this tunnel, parents.

56
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.040
His reference frame is going to be embedded on the back of his train.

57
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.620
Just how we used it in our derivations.

58
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.390
We want to remain consistent for that reason at times equals zero.

59
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.960
Event one when the left door closes and Phillips frame that occurs at X equals zero.

60
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.400
Now for the event number two on the right side in Philip's frame at time, two equals zero.

61
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:40.450
That occurs at 20 feet because the tunnel is 20 feet, and we know that that's an observable fact that

62
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.360
both parents and Philip would agree upon if there was no relative motion, right?

63
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.610
That's literally the length in the rest frame, the proper length, if you will.

64
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.250
OK, taking this guy and I knew handy, Danny told the Lorenz transformation.

65
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.460
We can figure out what both of these guys are equivalent to the terrorists reference frame.

66
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.580
And if I'm correct, we will find that the times will differ from both events and we will hope that

67
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.270
the right event will close right now.

68
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.510
What I'm going to do first is I'm going to look at event number one the door on the left, so I'm going

69
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.240
to write that down as event number one.

70
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.130
And what we're going to try to figure out is first, let's go with the length.

71
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.680
Let's take a look at our conception of space, how that's going to be affected, according to our nice

72
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.750
new translating map.

73
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:42.790
OK, so what we know is that as recorded here, according to Parents x Prime, his measurement should

74
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.810
be defined as such.

75
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.920
So our mapping says we should translate Philip's measurements by multiplying them by this Lorentz factor

76
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:58.330
and calculating the quantity x minus the T. So if I want event one, these guys will all have to be

77
00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.930
as such.

78
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.750
These quantities are in terms of his measurements.

79
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.930
So what we can do is we can just plug in your baby.

80
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.630
So we get gamma, we plug in x one.

81
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.070
That's just zero minus B times T one.

82
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.120
That's zero.

83
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.790
Not surprisingly, x one prime is equal to zero.

84
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.780
So when this happens, when this door actually closes.

85
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:35.790
What we find is that this guy is aligned right there, so it closes right on the left side of him.

86
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.390
Good.

87
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.640
It doesn't get cut off according to this, but let's see when it actually occurs.

88
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.520
OK, we need to tackle the conception of time next.

89
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:56.370
So according to Team One, we take this sort of a bit more complicated formula gamma and we take the

90
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.620
quantities in terms of Philip's measurements.

91
00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.690
So T minus B over C squared times x.

92
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:11.100
And since we're dealing with event one, we want T one and X one, they're both zero.

93
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.220
So this gives us a very uninteresting result, right?

94
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.670
This becomes nothing more than gamma times zero minus B or C squared times zero.

95
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.830
Oh, that's easy.

96
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.370
That's zero 31 from zero.

97
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.840
And initially, that seems pretty odd.

98
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.350
It's not ideal what I told you.

99
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:32.950
Right?

100
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.870
Because to you, one prime is zero.

101
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.460
That means that when it closes on the left side of this train car.

102
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:46.100
That's going to occur at time T equals zero, but wait a second that's supposed to occur.

103
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.720
Second.

104
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.790
Stick in their resolve this problem.

105
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:55.760
So this is what happens according to Terrence, according to his clock.

106
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.550
Let's see what happens with the event, too.

107
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.420
Maybe that can elucidate a bit more information.

108
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.500
So who are event number two?

109
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.580
What we could do is the same exact operation.

110
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.070
We're going to start first with the conception of space.

111
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:18.890
So we take X two from equal to gamma x two minus B C to and for this one.

112
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.820
We actually have some quantities we can work through here.

113
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.420
We got the twenty for the X2, so let's try and plug that guy in.

114
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:34.310
So we got really the runs factor two point seventy seven one, which was contained right down here and

115
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:42.740
four x two we get twenty feet minus B times T two, which was nothing more than zero seconds.

116
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.330
So we get this, we do that calculation.

117
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:53.720
We find that X2 frame is equal to that calculation, which is nothing more than fifty five point four

118
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.130
to beat or the proper length.

119
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:05.160
All this boxcar, so when you've got two sleds up, it's going to be right up the right side of this

120
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.790
boxcar.

121
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.650
It's not going to slice it in half.

122
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.320
So that proves that idea that I told you.

123
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.750
But when does this actually occur?

124
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.820
Is there simultaneity of the events?

125
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:21.120
Let's figure that out by considering the conception of time, the conception of time, so we could do

126
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.350
the same exact calculation to produce our nice, handy dandy map.

127
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:33.390
Translate this information into terraces, and we just write down the same exact formula so we get to

128
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:37.380
minus B over C squared times x two.

129
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:44.680
And we just throw all these guys in, so what we end up with is two point seven seven one four a Lawrence

130
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.220
factor.

131
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.340
We're going to plug in zero for the time and then we need to plug in these guys.

132
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.420
So what I'm going to say is B is this time C.

133
00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.320
So I'm just going to say I'm going to cancel the C and use the factor.

134
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.450
So this is zero point nine three two six one.

135
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.300
And you may have noticed that.

136
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.060
This value in the original movie was zero point nine, three three.

137
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.410
I'm using more precision, so we get the correct result.

138
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:16.840
Right.

139
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.690
If you use point, you're to guess actually big sources of error.

140
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.480
So I'm just using more precision in our measurements.

141
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:30.780
I'm not rounding closer to the third decimal place, so we take that guy and we need to divide by the

142
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:36.600
speed, which is three times and to the eight meters per second.

143
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:47.970
And then we need to multiply by X to well, X two is 20 feet and we have a disparity.

144
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.500
Don't raise this problem.

145
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.880
When you're running through problems with special relativity units up the match up, they start the

146
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.390
match up.

147
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.400
So we're looking for seconds.

148
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.230
We have feet here, we got meters here.

149
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:02.580
We need to convert those feet or two meters, so that cancels out properly.

150
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:07.380
And I like to do this by just searching for it and Google, it gives you a nice conversion rate.

151
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:15.060
So what you find if you do that is you can multiply by the factor, which says that in one foot you

152
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.990
have points.

153
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.500
Three, zero, four eight.

154
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.610
Meters per one foot.

155
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.980
And then you need another racket there.

156
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.190
So when you run through this calculation right here, what you end up with is actually, oh, that's

157
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.580
interesting.

158
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:40.220
Whoa.

159
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.140
Negative sign here.

160
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.830
So you get a negative.

161
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.590
Five point twenty five.

162
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.080
One times 10 to the minus eight

163
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.620
seconds.

164
00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:04.940
And if you've worked with units in the negative, that's close to that problem, you know that a nanosecond

165
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.530
is 10 to the minus nine.

166
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.380
So what you could do is you can move this guy over there.

167
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.250
And then this becomes minus nine, right, because if it's minus nine, he moved over there and then

168
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.340
you get minus eight and you could say this is nothing more than negative.

169
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:25.340
Fifty two point five, one nanoseconds.

170
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.500
You get that.

171
00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.940
And he said, wait a minute, how can you have negative sign?

172
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.750
We're not going back into the past, we can't reverse the flow of time.

173
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.550
What does that mean?

174
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.880
What what the hell is going on here?

175
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.030
Well, calm down.

176
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.150
I'm going to sort this out for us.

177
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:49.510
What this is stating is that, according to Terrence, this clock, according to his timeline, the

178
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:55.720
event of the door slamming up at events u occurs prior to when he starts his stopwatch.

179
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.460
That means that event two.

180
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.340
Yes, indeed, that does occur first.

181
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.900
And then it shoots up at that point.

182
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.910
It's going to shoot up fifty five point four two feet in front of him.

183
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.340
And.

184
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.690
In essence, what happens is it comes up, comes down, he flies up.

185
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:23.560
Then after this amount of time has transpired fifty two point five one nanoseconds short amount of time.

186
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.490
What you see is that who this guy is in line.

187
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.220
The back of that car is in lower left side of this tunnel.

188
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.270
The gate goes up.

189
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.080
It goes down.

190
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.170
He does not get cut up and everything is fine.

191
00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.950
So everything I told you was true.

192
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.540
Everything I told you was true.

193
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.070
Let's summarize this and do one additional check.

194
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:52.450
OK, so what we can do is I'm going to erase this and I have the information retained in my notebook

195
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.520
and I'm going to draw up some scenarios.

196
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.990
So initially.

197
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.720
What's going to happen is.

198
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.860
So event number two, that's going to occur first.

199
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:11.040
Fifty two point five nanoseconds before left side goes up, according to terrorists, a court parents.

200
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.080
That's his experience of the universe.

201
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:14.790
What's going to happen is.

202
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.770
We're going to have some kind of ground there.

203
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:28.480
We're going to have we're going to have a train car going and maybe about that size to be like that

204
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:35.530
and then we're going to have a tunnel which is going to be maybe something like this should.

205
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:43.560
At this point, this is events where we're going off to, but sort of like event one, so it's at same

206
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.120
time as event one and Event two, all that sort of confusing.

207
00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.590
We're just going to call it event number two just to stay in line.

208
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.360
I don't want to give you advice.

209
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.940
OK, so you then number two at this point?

210
00:14:54.810 --> 00:15:00.540
We know that from here to here in Terrence's reference frame, this is the proper length.

211
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.090
This is fifty five point four to each.

212
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:12.010
According to him, this guy, you remember what we found in the video.

213
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:19.180
This guy has to be contracted because, oh, wait a minute, this length 20 feet is a it's at addressed

214
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:20.380
in a Phillips frame.

215
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.200
So that has to get you contracted.

216
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:30.310
So this guy is nothing more than 20 feet over Gamma Gowanus 2.7 one.

217
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:36.520
And what I calculated for that is about seven point two two feet.

218
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.670
So this guy.

219
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:48.230
Right here at this point in time, this should be nothing more than this guy minus that.

220
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.040
But also, so what is that?

221
00:15:55.210 --> 00:16:03.040
Quick math, so you have 40 at 47 and about three and a five, it's should be close to about 48 it.

222
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.080
I'm going to just put that really quick.

223
00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.180
48.

224
00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.440
According to him, this is according to him, right?

225
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:13.690
Because this is the contract a lengthy sees when this is borrowed against the right side of that tunnel.

226
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.540
So if this really is correct, this life here, I'll call it.

227
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.110
I'll just call it out.

228
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:31.720
This should be the distance that this train travels in the interval, we calculated that fifty two point

229
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.530
five nanoseconds.

230
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:32.740
Right.

231
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.870
Because after that occurs, this guy should be buddy up to the left, which means that it has to travel

232
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.690
that amount of distance to compensate for that.

233
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:49.420
So what we should find is that El or Delta X should be the velocity which both Wheelock and Terrence

234
00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.560
agree upon, right?

235
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.520
They don't agree.

236
00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:56.290
They don't disagree about the relative motion between them this time.

237
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.230
Delta T, the Delta T that occurred.

238
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.290
In this case, it's Terrence's conception, right?

239
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.410
Because this is an Terrence's Terrence's world.

240
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.780
So I'm going to put actually a little dash right there to designate that we want to be consistent with

241
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.910
units, be consistent with what reference frame you're in.

242
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:18.820
So if we take this, we should be able to take his velocity.

243
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:22.510
Zero point nine three What was that two six one?

244
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.210
That is correct.

245
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.110
And then that time, see right?

246
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.420
Three times 10 eight meters per second.

247
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:45.000
And then the Delta T Well, event one occurred at T equals zero to occur at negative fifty two point

248
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.220
five one nanosecond.

249
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.530
So let's put that in.

250
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.640
That's the Delta T from thirty two point five native fifty two point five two zero.

251
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.740
That's a delta of fifty two point five one.

252
00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:56.220
Right.

253
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:02.580
That's the time it transpires between this guy going up and coming down and then that guy going up,

254
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:03.030
coming down.

255
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.600
So this becomes fifty two point five one.

256
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.030
Times 10 to the minus nine.

257
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.040
Seconds.

258
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:19.220
And we want it in feet so we can make sense of this, that we need to multiply this guy.

259
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.730
I'm going to put this continuing on down in this line.

260
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.650
This guy becomes nothing more.

261
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.450
We're going from meters to feet.

262
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.980
So we want one foot how many meters we're in a foot?

263
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.730
Well, I said that previously, that's zero point three zero four eight.

264
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:36.810
Meters.

265
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:45.450
And if you went out MATLAB, Mathematica or your old school tie in three or maybe even more because

266
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.640
I would only use that if I didn't have the other tools.

267
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.380
But if you if you put this into some kind of computational tool, what you're going to find is that

268
00:18:52.380 --> 00:19:00.150
you get a result, which is forty eight point two feet, which agrees with this because forty eight

269
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.470
point two plus seven point two two Oh, does that match up?

270
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:05.790
Quick math.

271
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.460
My head up.

272
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.020
Yes, that does.

273
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.390
Yes, that matches up.

274
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.960
Exactly.

275
00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:13.620
So.

276
00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:21.570
We find that this gels well with our intuition, so yes, it occurred previously to when he started

277
00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.970
his his his clock.

278
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.860
And what's important is the deltas between the time, which gives us this distance here.

279
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.730
So what happens is we see that.

280
00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:37.160
Yes, indeed.

281
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.750
This event occurs first and taxes frame and then event number one.

282
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.250
So keep flying right by it with and right by.

283
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.380
So event number one, what that looks like is we draw all the ground.

284
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.650
We'd roll the box car.

285
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.280
It looks like it shrank, but it did it on just a terrible artist.

286
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.000
And then what we find is the tunnel.

287
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.560
It's going to look something like that.

288
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.000
So in this situation.

289
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:16.420
Events the sky is going up, and he does not get cut off.

290
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:17.770
Yes.

291
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.700
Yes.

292
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:26.230
We have proven that using the Lawrence transformation, the simultaneity of events is relative, not

293
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.860
absolute.

294
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:33.910
This is the mathematical derivation of what transpired and that weird, wacky paradox I won over.

295
00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.700
And this really demonstrates the power of the Lorenz transformation.

296
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.860
So what have we done?

297
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.030
What have we done in this course?

298
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.740
We've done some beautiful work.

299
00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:51.430
We've derived interesting phenomena such as time dilation, length contraction, paired them up together

300
00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:57.760
and use that as a foundational principle, foundational support for erecting this bridge that would

301
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.710
not fall apart, that would not collapse.

302
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:07.570
That allows us to bridge the gap between an infinite set of conceptions or perceptions of the universe.

303
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:15.810
So regardless of how trance, how events transpire or arise in front of you, according to your eyes,

304
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.860
according to your perspectives, your experiences, you can take those events.

305
00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:28.180
You can use this map the Lorenz transformation to switch between them using your information.

306
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:34.390
Your information, whether it be from Terrence to fill up or fill up the parents and your concessions

307
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.020
will agree, you agree about the results.

308
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.880
You agree about what actually happens.

309
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:41.920
And there's no confusion.

310
00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.450
Congratulations.

311
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.390
You are a master of special relativity.

312
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:53.680
Next, what we want to do is we want to take what we derived here and revisit what I called the Lost

313
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.600
Velocity Edition back in close to the first video we put out.

314
00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:05.920
And in that video, we found that when you shoot a light, when you're traveling close to the speed

315
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.900
of light, some weird phenomena happens.

316
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.890
We're going to resolve that.

317
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:15.550
We're going to make sense of what happens, and we're going to derive one more kinematic expression

318
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:21.580
for special relativity, which helps us show how different relative velocities arise.

319
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.020
Hope you enjoy that?

320
00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.260
Hope you enjoyed reconciling this weird paradox.

321
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.310
Stay tuned.
