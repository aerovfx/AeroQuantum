00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
As we embarked on our journey into the wacky world of special relativity, we began by putting together

2
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.510
a seemingly infallible, absolute conception of the universe.

3
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.140
All right.

4
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.620
Well, we were trying to do is we were trying to bridge the gap between almost an infinite set of perceptions

5
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.550
of the universe, right?

6
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.580
We were trying to have somebody experience the easily translated into somebody else's such that we have

7
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.900
that this absolute conception of the universe, right?

8
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.930
This is what I've been repeating multiple times as we went through all these different concepts in special

9
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.470
relativity.

10
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.430
Now what I want to do is I want to take what we initially established, which is known as the Galilean

11
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.700
transformation, which I have written up right here and correct the flaws that were inherent in that

12
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.150
approach.

13
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.790
What do we discover with the Galilean transformation was we see right here is that pretty straightforward

14
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:18.720
mapping, which helps us translate experiences very easily and seamlessly into different perceptions

15
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.290
of the universe?

16
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.700
And that allows us to agree on one single idea and allow us to communicate or talk about different experiences

17
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.870
and different reference frames.

18
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.170
But what we found is that the Galileo transformation is nothing more than a limited snapshot of a bigger,

19
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.220
fuller picture, right?

20
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.730
The Galileo transformation is only true in a Newtonian sense, when the speed of a reference frame is

21
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.400
very low compared to the speed of light.

22
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.930
However, what we found throughout this course in all the different concepts we've studied quite thoroughly,

23
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.190
is that when we start traveling close to the speed of light, this transformation completely and utterly

24
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.940
falls apart.

25
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.900
And when you're doing physics, any kind of law, any kind of transformation or any conception of the

26
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.400
universe is only valid if it can encapsulate and describe every kind of situation that arises right

27
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.030
in front of you.

28
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.030
So what we need to do is we're going to we're going to need to correct this so that it accounts for

29
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.230
those experiences and those weird phenomena that arise at high speeds close to the speed of light.

30
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.590
OK, so what we're going to do in this video is we're going to finally take that limited snapshot and

31
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.310
allow to encapsulate and cover these experiences, these situations.

32
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.690
OK.

33
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.930
And the way in which we're going to bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions of the universe

34
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.750
is we're going to take the foundational principles we just arrived in the previous few videos.

35
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.030
These are the concepts of time dilation and length contraction.

36
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.670
In essence, they're going to form the foundational support that is going to hold this bridge up as

37
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.890
we erect the bridge between these different varying perceptions of the universe.

38
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.180
OK?

39
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.420
These are going to form the foundational ideas that are going to hold it together and allow us to to

40
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.060
finally put together that nice bridge.

41
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.970
So we get that most conception of the universe that encompasses everything that can transpire right

42
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:24.660
in front of us.

43
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.220
How are we going to do that?

44
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.790
We're going to do that by revisiting what turns it fill up have been working on right exactly how we

45
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.280
did it just with the galley and transformation.

46
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.700
And that's why I want to provide a brief overview of the result that came out of it and also what they

47
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.000
did.

48
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.770
So when we derive that what we had, we had Philip standing on the Earth.

49
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.300
We had Terence in a boxcar, the train.

50
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.010
In essence, that was going pretty fast to the right with a speed.

51
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.580
So we're going to the same situation.

52
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.980
But in this scenario, Terence is going to travel close to the speed of light.

53
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.070
And as we would expect, we're going to see weird phenomena arise, such as again, time, elation and

54
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.700
traction.

55
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.490
But this time we know how to describe it properly.

56
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.580
So the correct mapping the correct bridge should fall out and we should be good to go.

57
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.120
OK.

58
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:30.450
So the situation that's going to happen is initially Terence, who has reference Frame s prime, he's

59
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.080
going to have his axes attached to the back of the train car ex-prime y prime and at time T equals zero,

60
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.310
which they both agree on.

61
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.640
He's going to hit the gas.

62
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:46.710
He's going to instantly accelerate at a velocity equal to maybe like point nine times the speed of light

63
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.700
point nine C.

64
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:57.660
So we'll put this guy in here zero point nine C and then fill up whose reference frame s has an X and

65
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.140
Y.

66
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.160
Axes he's going to stay at the organo and terrorist is going to fly straight to the right.

67
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.510
OK.

68
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.130
During this exercise.

69
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.210
What's going to happen is an event is going to transpire and they're both going to record their experience

70
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.200
of that event.

71
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.600
Now what we know is that each individual's conception of that event may be different.

72
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:28.380
But if we can account for all these different phenomena and try to translate between them right, we

73
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.000
can get this universal conception that both Terrance and Phillip agree upon.

74
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.580
OK, so let's run through the experiment.

75
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.150
Let's see what they can do right now when we do this.

76
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.370
There are two important things we want to offer.

77
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.400
First, want to make sure that our conception of the space and time are correctly accounted for.

78
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.440
That's going to be taken care of by we discover with time, elation and length contraction.

79
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:59.550
And secondly, and any kind of theory, any kind of mapping we come up with must account for the gallantry

80
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.560
and transformation at small speeds.

81
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.560
In other words, when we start going at lower speeds that are close to the speed of light, it should

82
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.890
converge upon this result that we had.

83
00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.510
So we'll be doing those checks.

84
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:18.630
And if it does agree with that, that's going to strengthen the theory come up with and make us feel

85
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.320
more confident that the result we've generated is valid.

86
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:30.210
OK, so the first thing we're going to tackle is the conception of space and how length contraction

87
00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.340
is going to slightly alter this mapping of the Galilean transformation that we have here.

88
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.950
That's one element that we have to account for as we erect this bridge between two different perceptions.

89
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.320
The other one is going to be their conception of time, which again is taking care of my time dilation.

90
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.680
OK?

91
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:50.610
But what these two pillars, these two foundational supports?

92
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.970
It's going to hold that that bridge afloat.

93
00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.720
It's going to allow it to stay in place and it's not going to crumble and come crashing down and leave

94
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.190
us sat out of luck.

95
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.480
OK, so let's take care of the space conception first.

96
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.110
OK.

97
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.800
So.

98
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:15.450
Well, we're trying to relate to this conception of space to tell us what we're going to do is fill

99
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.640
up.

100
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.740
It's going to say OK when he speeds off at a concert velocity v.

101
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:26.520
I know that the boxcar is going to be a distance v t again, exactly what we've done previously.

102
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.520
I mean, refresh your memory that x is the Delta T since we're gonna be.

103
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.980
This guy gives you that distance.

104
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:42.100
And then you have to add on Terrence's conception, which is from the back of the train all the way

105
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.760
to the event.

106
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.160
OK.

107
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.290
And that's going to happen again to sort of bored these experiments.

108
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.870
So they're going to make it a little exciting, a little fun.

109
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:58.420
What test does is he lights a firecracker inside the train car, and when that blows up, it's going

110
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:07.360
to leave a mark on a train such that you can measure from the back of the train to that that mark on

111
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:07.810
the train.

112
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.620
So.

113
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:16.000
Whenever you're dealing with flies, when you're dealing with space and you're doing a length contraction

114
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.540
problem.

115
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:24.670
What I said in the previous video is first, you want to be sure to designate a certain length as the

116
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:31.810
proper length, and the proper length was always defined as the length in the resting frame where the

117
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:36.370
body is not moving because a moving back body is observed to be contracted.

118
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:36.910
Right.

119
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:44.440
So in this case, the distance from the back of the car to the firecracker has to be the appropriate

120
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.610
length because in this reference frame, it's not moving.

121
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:56.500
But in Philip's reference frame, this length is moving so that body, that moving body will be observed

122
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.520
to be contracted.

123
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.730
That is the important key, that designation.

124
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.200
So we're going to try and have Philip over here.

125
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.870
He's unhappy.

126
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:10.300
He's always doing the the math, the physics, writing everything down here.

127
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.740
He's tired of doing this stuff.

128
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.750
He's got a little frown on his face.

129
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:19.480
He's going to try and figure out what turns this conception of space is relative to his arm.

130
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:30.760
OK, so to do that right, what we have here is x prime as X was that distance minus v t right v t plus

131
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.620
x prime gives you x simple geometric idea, but their conceptions of space.

132
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:45.730
They all agree on that because from their perception, experiences or rather events arise in a different

133
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.300
fashion.

134
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.360
So here's the important key.

135
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:57.880
What Philip is going to do is he's going to say, OK, I'm trying to figure out X Prime and I'm going

136
00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.970
to use X, which is measured in his frame.

137
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.120
This is his measurement of where the event occurs at a time T.

138
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:13.060
So this guy is measured in his reference frames and v t he's going to take his own time.

139
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.470
He's a stopwatch.

140
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.160
So that means that v t is also measured in this.

141
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:24.220
So this quantity that is going to use to calculate X prime, this is the key idea.

142
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.550
X prime.

143
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.290
So it's going to be x minus v t.

144
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.940
This is a measurement in his reference frame.

145
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.970
OK, so.

146
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.830
ex-Prime.

147
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.250
He's going to report the contract at length.

148
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.900
This is not ex-Prime, because his conception of space is different than Terence's conception, right,

149
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:56.090
so this has to account for length contract and this is why this is the supporting idea for the bridge.

150
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:05.130
OK, so this is not merely ex-prime, it's it's prime over can either go over that again quickly because

151
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.290
this is very important if you don't.

152
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.290
Comprehend this idea, then the entire derivation falls apart again.

153
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.970
Philip is trying to measure Terrence's conception of the distance from the back of the car to firecracker

154
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.530
what he's going to do.

155
00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.690
He's going to use Measurements X and VTi.

156
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.230
That are measured.

157
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:39.170
In reference frame s, if he's doing that, his conception of time or his conception of life is the

158
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:45.050
light in reference frame, as which means he's trying to get the length of a moving body and a moving

159
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.760
body is observed to be contracted.

160
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:47.930
So.

161
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.980
He's going to take the proper length L, not the by Ghana.

162
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:59.470
Basically, the contract at length, in essence, all we're doing is we're saying this is sort of like

163
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:01.210
Elmont over again.

164
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.590
That's all we did.

165
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:03.670
That's all we did.

166
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.170
That's this guy right here.

167
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.370
OK, so if we take this, what happens is.

168
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:22.290
We get X is equal to X, prime is equal to gamma x minus the 18, and then so this gives us a mapping

169
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.080
where it fill up those measurements.

170
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:32.550
You can multiply by the Lorentz factor and you can say that I translate my language, my conception,

171
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.990
my experience in terms is very simply by multiplying by.

172
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.740
That seems to jive well for intuition because again, it's very similar to what we saw with the last

173
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.130
contraction and elation.

174
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.770
OK.

175
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:48.870
So.

176
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:58.830
As I said, in order to do this properly, we must make sure that the bridge we erect accounts for space

177
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:05.880
and time correctly space time, but also that it gels well with the Galilean transformation in certain

178
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.830
situations, particularly when the velocity is not close to the speed of light.

179
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.350
OK, so we have here ex prime is equal to gamma.

180
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.530
That's at spontaneity, very similar to the Galilean transformation.

181
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:30.390
Now let's question what happens when a vastly is much less than see if V is much less than see.

182
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.110
What do we know?

183
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:40.840
Well, we know the Galilean transformation, rather, the sorry about the Lorenz factor is no more than

184
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.160
one over the square root of one minus v oversee the square.

185
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.380
So B is much less than C.

186
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.680
This guy is essentially zero.

187
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.900
It's super, super small.

188
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.630
And this becomes approximately one.

189
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.230
OK, so in that situation.

190
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.870
We can assert that JAMA is approximately equal to one.

191
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.940
And when we make that assertion.

192
00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:14.420
This guy, prime, it's people to Gamma X minus VCE.

193
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.350
Is nothing more than ex prime equals one times that where does is just this.

194
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.640
And if we compare that up to their.

195
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:35.160
We're pretty excited because it converges upon this, which means that our theory, our idea came out

196
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.030
pretty accurately right at Charles Hall for our intuition.

197
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.940
So that's good, OK.

198
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.540
So.

199
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.170
At this point, we've taken care of space.

200
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.880
Our conception of space using our foundational principle of length contraction.

201
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:54.830
So we have up the left portion of the bridge erected next.

202
00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:01.290
What we want to do is take a look at their conception of time, make sure that we account for properly

203
00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:07.380
of time dilation and then figure out how we can correct this idea here that time.

204
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.870
How we suppose that time was equivalent between different perceptions of events.

205
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:19.280
Even though that is not quite true, that time may tick differently, depending upon your reference.

206
00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.240
Let's do that next.
