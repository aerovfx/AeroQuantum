1
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:18,670
All right.

2
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,890
Sort of finish the construction of this bridge and rectify their varying conceptions of time.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,150
What we're going to do is we're going to take another look at the same experiment, but it's going to

4
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,950
be slightly different such that we can massage the right result out of it.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,840
What's going to happen is we're still going to have terrorists speeding away to the right in a train

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,300
and fill up observing it from the ground.

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:49,690
But the event we're going to take a look at is not a firework in Terrence's train, but rather a firework

8
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,340
that fill up shoots against a wall that Terence has passed.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,810
So it blows up and makes a mark on that wall because you know what builds over here?

10
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,970
He's that he's bored is like, what the hell I want?

11
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:01,660
Have some fun too.

12
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,800
So he shoots the firework and blows up on the wall and makes a mark.

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,500
And now we're going to use this to take a look at both of their conceptions of time and see how, ah,

14
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,530
the the time of which this arises, how it's going to differ between the two.

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,860
And then, you know, where is the gap between there can set the pace.

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,790
The way in which we do that is similar to what we did with the Galilean transformation.

17
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,020
What we're trying to figure out how they're there, lengths are going to vary.

18
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:35,020
And what's important to note is that from Philip, when he's trying to figure out whether or not are

19
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:41,890
you versus the opposite direction when Terence is trying to figure out Philip's time and length, his

20
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:48,580
measurements are going to use time in his reference frame to prime and also explain prime in his reference

21
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,820
frame.

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:55,840
He's going to use that to try and predict what Philip Philip will use to account for the length from

23
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:03,370
his reference point all the way to event number two, where the firework blowing up on the wall somewhere.

24
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,990
Well, if she does, that is, you know, it's simple geometric ideas here.

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,170
What you can do is he knows that he has traveled around a Philip has moved away from him from his point

26
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:22,060
of view, from his point of view, a distance of v t prime that he measures with the time on his train.

27
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,720
And remember, time is going to flow differently on his train because the experience transpires differently

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,980
based upon his reference frame.

29
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:38,410
So it's going to say Viti Prime MP subtracts where he thinks the event occurs ex-prime from that guy.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,150
Or rather add them all right, because this is negative.

31
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,830
He's going to get X.

32
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:51,600
In other words, you have X plus x prime y is equal to V T Prime take over.

33
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,980
That guy?

34
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,360
And you would get get the same exact result, right?

35
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,830
Using geometric constraints here, so what he says is he's trying to figure out X, he's like, he says,

36
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,810
Oh, well, that's just equal to.

37
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,040
ex-Prime.

38
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,430
Los.

39
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:21,370
The ETF, right again, Ron Run plans tried to get you X, but this is the important thing to remember

40
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,510
this guy.

41
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,500
And this guy.

42
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,720
These are measurements in a reference frame s.

43
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,770
OK, let's write that down measured.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,930
In as prime, not us, as we did previously.

45
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,130
So.

46
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:45,800
His conception of Philip's length of X might be a little different.

47
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,240
Let's take a step back.

48
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,340
What we know is that from Phillip's standpoint, and this is where it's going to differ from the last

49
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,060
experiment, we just take this from him to this mark.

50
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,360
Going to because it's going to be the length at rest.

51
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,080
Nothing is moving.

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,730
There's no moving body, right?

53
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:02,390
Right.

54
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:11,300
So we would mark this length as the proper length right because a moving body as is observed to be contracted.

55
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,660
But the proper length is always the length in the reference frame where the distance is at rest.

56
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,780
So this is the rest, this is the proper length.

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,040
So to Terence, from his standpoint, this distance here as he moves looks like suit.

58
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,800
It's gone to the left and his vantage point.

59
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,860
So this length is a moving body and it's going to be observed to be contracted.

60
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,550
So his measurements are not going to give you simply x what Philip measures.

61
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,360
It's going to give his measurement his conception of this length x, which means that he's going to

62
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,290
see a moving body.

63
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,730
It has to be contracted.

64
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,860
So this guy is his conception of the length again, emphasis on that point.

65
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,840
So we take the X divided by gamma again, length contraction, and we end up with the following.

66
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:13,130
So it looks pretty similar to what we just found what we could do if we get X equal to gamma.

67
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,740
Science X Prime Plus V.

68
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,790
He prime.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,510
And we want to do is we want to isolate one of the times to prime so we can define it in terms of the

70
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,680
parameters of the other guy because we want, let's say, s prime.

71
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,710
Philip, we want him to say, OK, I've got my time.

72
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:36,820
I got my life.

73
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,230
Let's use that to switch over to Terrence this time.

74
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,470
So we need to get rid of this prime somehow.

75
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,550
How do we do that?

76
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,640
Well, we've already derived a map, a bridge between their conceptions, which was this guy, right?

77
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,120
So we could take that was thrown into the equation and see what we end up with.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,080
So if we do that?

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:12,690
We get our Lawrence Potter gamma expert is no more than an X minus the tea, not a prime plus v tip,

80
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,000
right?

81
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,970
OK, so we're making some headway here.

82
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,990
I'm just going to grab my notebook here, and that's what we need to do.

83
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,670
And again, I missed a little parameter here because remember, this is this is actually I wrote this

84
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,010
up incorrectly, so this should be again as we found.

85
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,100
Sorry about like us.

86
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,650
So this becomes a gamma.

87
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,950
And we just need to distribute the terms and see what we end up with.

88
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,250
Well.

89
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,180
Jonathan Sgamma let's go to square.

90
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,210
X.

91
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,350
Minus.

92
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,260
Ghana squared the tea.

93
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,320
Plus, Gamma V, right?

94
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,050
All right, we're making headway here.

95
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,860
So now we want to do is we want a group like terms and then isolate the term we're interested in finding,

96
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,190
remember, we want to express pride in terms of the parameters from the other records so they can switch

97
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,930
between each other.

98
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,480
It's a map.

99
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,250
Remember a way to translate.

100
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,370
So what we could do is we could take this x.

101
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,590
We see common terms.

102
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,080
We could take out a squared move that over.

103
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,940
And what we end up with is a one minus gamma squared.

104
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,940
Multiply by acts, we could pull this guy over to the gamma square feet.

105
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,470
So we just add.

106
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,350
Gamma squared.

107
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,150
Viti.

108
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,050
And that leads are gonna be prime on the right side, so we're making headway, we're getting close.

109
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,740
What we need to do is we need to isolate this guy.

110
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,120
So what I'm going to do is honor the vibe by Gamma B and flip the equation.

111
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,440
So it's more in line with what we're looking for.

112
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,360
We're looking for trouble.

113
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,030
I like it on the left side.

114
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,760
That's wrong to you.

115
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,410
So we take T Prime.

116
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,940
We say that is equal to this guy, all this stuff.

117
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,680
What am I gonna be?

118
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,340
OK.

119
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,700
So we take one minus gamma squared.

120
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,300
Provided by Gamma V..

121
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,350
And that is multiply by X.

122
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:32,120
And then this guy got squared being divided by Gallup is no different than times team.

123
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,350
So we need to add on that gamma.

124
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:40,080
Times key component at this point, you're like, whoa, wait a second.

125
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,880
That does not look very nice.

126
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,220
We didn't make much headway here.

127
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,520
That looks pretty complicated.

128
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,510
So what we want to do is we want to make board space.

129
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:54,840
And then we're going to try and massage this little guy right here so we can groove terms and get this

130
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,510
nice expression that we can use for describing to you front.

131
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,180
OK.

132
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,250
That's going to be our map, right?

133
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,240
We want to be simple.

134
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,960
All right.

135
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,300
When you translate stuff, you don't want it to be too complicated.

136
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,280
You want it to be very quick and efficient.

137
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,650
So we take this guy here and we could say, Hey, wait a second.

138
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,850
If we take one minus gamma squared, we cannot be.

139
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,470
We know gamma is a function of the four, so maybe we can throw that in there.

140
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,210
Somehow we get this nice, elegant gamma to pull that out front and we can group terms and it looks

141
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,500
much nicer.

142
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,170
Okay, so we take one.

143
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,580
Minus gamma squared.

144
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,800
Over again, maybe this guy right here and we say, oh, wait, a second, that's.

145
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,860
Well, we could take the one hour we we could pull that guy out.

146
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,990
And then we end up with one over Karma.

147
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,480
Minus Myanmar, right?

148
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,180
Right.

149
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:02,280
And also, we know that Gamma, as I was just saying, gamma is nothing more than one of the square

150
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,440
root of one minus v over C.

151
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,780
So if we plug that in, maybe we can incorporate that v inside, right?

152
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,830
That's the name again.

153
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,730
That's the name again, maybe.

154
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,090
So we set that equal to one over B.

155
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,330
If those brackets flip that that guy up.

156
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,910
We take the square root of one minus v over C that guy squared.

157
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,790
And then we have a minus one over root one minus three over C, and I promise we're painful a lot of

158
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,180
algebra.

159
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,190
But when we're done, it's going to look nice.

160
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,530
I promise you can hold me accountable.

161
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:46,430
So we get this and we say, OK, let's make the same denominator for both of these terms, and maybe

162
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,360
we can group them together.

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,840
So what we want to do is we want to multiply this guy by the square root of one line is B or C squared,

164
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,480
divided by the square root of one minus VRC squared.

165
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,520
In essence, we're just multiplying it by one.

166
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,480
You know what I mean?

167
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:08,630
So this guy just becomes nothing more than o one, minus the R C quantity squared.

168
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,010
Because remember, if I'm multiplying by this, the term here divided by the same term?

169
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:21,020
Square over town, square root is nothing more than that quantity to the one and basically that some

170
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,740
gripping the term.

171
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,910
So that's this guy.

172
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Then this term here minus one, we divide that guy by the square root one minus v over C squared.

173
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,810
And when we get this, we see, oh, wait, a second, that just cancels that and we get this nice time

174
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,700
here, which is no different than.

175
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,920
Backing up and putting the correct term for.

176
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:48,940
Right.

177
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,470
We don't want to mislead you guys.

178
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,280
So I forgot that one of your and it has to carry along for the ride.

179
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:54,580
Right?

180
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,200
We don't just kick him off.

181
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,020
He's not smelly enough to kick him out.

182
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,890
So what we end up with is negative the quantity of oversee this guy squared.

183
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,070
That's going to be over.

184
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:17,320
That square root one minus VRC squared, but we know that this guy is no different than just so we can

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,910
multiply that by gamma.

186
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,880
And we have the one over be right in front.

187
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,250
OK, so we end up with that.

188
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:29,660
And what happens is.

189
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:38,020
Well, you divide by that guy at the and we get a B over C squared.

190
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:46,350
Times Sgamma oh, look at that is much nicer than this monstrosity right there.

191
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,420
We want to get rid of that guy.

192
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,370
So when we take this guy, this this negative term, I want to forget the negative.

193
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,290
And we make some board space to get rid of all that work.

194
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,750
We don't like it anyway, we won't get rid of that algebra.

195
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,940
So we say that this guy coming up here, this this is no different than.

196
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,900
This guy basically up here.

197
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,850
Te Prime.

198
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,910
It's no different than.

199
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:32,960
This guy becomes negative B over C squared times are gonna on X plus Yamauchi, and now you have a we

200
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,330
have a common term, we can factor that baby out and it's going to look much nicer and much more manageable.

201
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,240
So we do that, we get the gamma, so we pop that out.

202
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm going to use the tea first and then I'm going to subtract.

203
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,280
The.

204
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,000
Overseas squared and multiply by X.

205
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:02,590
And if we did all that correctly, the results should agree with my notes, which it does because you're

206
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,130
awesome.

207
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,350
You did the math correctly with me.

208
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,770
It was your presence that helped us get the right result.

209
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,990
So we got this guy right here.

210
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,720
And we find that.

211
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,220
Philip can figure out Terrence, this time by taking his calculations and multiplying all this junk

212
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,790
in front of it.

213
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,440
OK.

214
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,050
But.

215
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,900
What's important is.

216
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,910
We've accounted for space.

217
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,410
We've accounted for the correct conception of time.

218
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,480
And now the last ingredient, remember what I said, this should agree with what we find here.

219
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,400
That's pretty complicated.

220
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,160
So we're going to have to spend a bit more time on that.

221
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:58,590
What we want to do is make some more board space and then say what happens if we is much less sea or

222
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,430
in other words?

223
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,820
We're going to say.

224
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:14,060
If V is much left to see, we know again the Lorentz factor as we found this guy just becomes approximately

225
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,940
one, because remember, viewers see that's approximately zero.

226
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:26,590
And then one minus zero, that's one on the bottom, one of our one, it's pretty much one.

227
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,440
So again, gamma is still approximately one.

228
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:36,730
But when that happens, we find that S. Prime is equal to one.

229
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:44,400
Signs T, oh, look at that we got we oversee what is this, what is this term for an ex?

230
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,900
This is b over three times one, obviously.

231
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,140
Oh, wait a minute.

232
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,990
We oversee is very small and only divide by three times 10 to the eight meters per second.

233
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,360
That's extremely small, which means that this guy is essentially zero in front of the X.

234
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,780
Doesn't matter how big access this guy is infinitely small compared to the T. It's going to have no

235
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,020
effect.

236
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,970
That's like saying, Oh, we got T.

237
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:15,420
Maybe T is ten plus point zero zero zero zero zero b you want.

238
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,870
When you add that together, you get like it's at 10.

239
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,490
That's in essence what we're doing.

240
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:28,230
So this is the simplification that the Gaussian transformation and that are concessions of time are

241
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,920
basically making every day when we observe events, right?

242
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:35,730
It's sort of like our minds can't keep up with what's going on in a sense.

243
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:48,090
So you assert that this is minus zero and prime is essentially equal to T band that mass that we had

244
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,180
in the galley and transformation, we got our conception of life.

245
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,520
We've got our conception of time and all that's left is our conception of Y and Z.

246
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:04,230
Well, it's we could do that pretty easily because we know that relativistic effects only arise in the

247
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,240
direction of which they're being applied.

248
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,780
So if you're basing your velocities in the X direction, the effect is in the X direction, in the Y

249
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,580
and Z direction, there is no effect.

250
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,580
There is no implied effect because that's right.

251
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,140
If you cruise along in this direction, your y conception, right?

252
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:27,390
Shares of Philip are not going to disagree about what that is going to end up being.

253
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,390
So we are in a good position right now.

254
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,420
We're in an excellent position because what we can say is.

255
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:45,860
We can erase all this stuff and we can say, Oh, Galilean transformation, you do not converge upon

256
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,260
every situation that can arise in the universe.

257
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,650
I'm going to take you through, are you in the wastebasket?

258
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:58,430
And I will replace you with something that's superior better and basically an all inclusive conception

259
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,120
of the universe.

260
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,320
So if we erase this, make that board space, bam, we put down racer and what we say.

261
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,580
Is the following, OK, so we get.

262
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,000
We get X.

263
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:23,490
For a time so mean that the relativistic effect that he's traveling in, the direction we get prime

264
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,740
is equal to gamma times x minus v t.

265
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,470
Or rather.

266
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,420
We only did this part here, so I'm going to put it over here.

267
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,150
We're going to say ex-Prime.

268
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,370
Is equal to gamma times x minus v t.

269
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:53,830
We're going to have why prime is equal to y z, prime is equal to Z, and then we're going to have our

270
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,700
conception of time.

271
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:01,960
C Prime is equal to gamma T minus v over C squared.

272
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,220
Times X.

273
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,840
OK, I'm going to make this little gap.

274
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,580
Sort of.

275
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,820
Put a little x on this guy because this guy is not proper anymore.

276
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:24,550
And what I've just done for you is derived.

277
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,550
What is known as?

278
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,030
The Lorenz transformation.

279
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:45,840
And it is named as such because both Einstein and Lorenz did derive this result right here, but.

280
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:55,670
Einstein was the individual who correctly interpreted it, so sometimes it is it has a group name,

281
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,070
I believe it's the Lorenz Einstein transformation.

282
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:06,590
But what is important is that our initial goal that we set out to conceive of and derive, which is

283
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:14,000
coming up with a universal conception of the universe, something which bridges the gap between an infinite

284
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,900
set of perceptions of events rising around us is nothing more than this guy right here.

285
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:28,430
We have erected that bridge using the foundational supports of time dilation and length contraction.

286
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,120
His is this beautiful result, this beautiful map the look or parents could use.

287
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:44,850
To translate their experiences into somebody else's experiences and their predictions, their results,

288
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:52,050
their conceptions can line up so they can they can actually have a conversation about it and have this

289
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,890
nice universal conception of the interest.

290
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,780
Hope you enjoy that derivation.

291
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:04,830
I hope you enjoyed us wrapping up the portion of this course for a lot of the kinematic ideas and special

292
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,490
relativity.

293
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,310
Next, what I want to do is I want to show you the power of the less Lawrence transformation and show

294
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:19,590
you how can help better explain very convoluted situations that arise in special relativity.

295
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,150
And we're going to do that by taking another look at the Einstein train paradox that we resolve previously.

296
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:34,020
And I'm going to show you how this map, which translates all this information very quickly, easily

297
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:40,520
and effortlessly, could help us reconcile what's going on and get to the correct conclusion quickly

298
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,810
and have proof of what's going on.

299
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,220
Stay tuned.
