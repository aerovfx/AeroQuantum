1
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.570
All right.

2
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.300
In our last video, we are able to make great progress in our study, a special relativity.

3
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.280
What exactly did we accomplish?

4
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.160
We are able to take the ideas that we discovered and proved previously, such as time dilation and length

5
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.750
contraction, and use that as a supporting evidence, the foundational support that allowed us to bridge

6
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.410
the gap between an infinite set of perceptions of the universe.

7
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.860
OK.

8
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.610
So in essence, what we did is we derive this nice map, this nice translational tool known as the evil

9
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:56.840
wrench transformation that allows us to easily and effortlessly translate the experiences of any individual

10
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.360
with any perspective of the universe, such that the events that arise in these different perspectives

11
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.330
can be related and talked about intelligently.

12
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.650
Now what we're going to do in this video is we're going to try and unleash the unlimited power and potential

13
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.480
that is inherent within this tool.

14
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.810
Now, previously we saw the power this tool offer in resolving dilemmas and problems, right?

15
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.070
We used it to effortlessly resolve Einstein's famous twin paradox, or rather not the twin powers.

16
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.630
The train paradox, right?

17
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.860
Using this map, we were able to reconcile discrepancies and events that different perspective perceptive

18
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.300
perceptions disagreed about, and we resolve that pretty easily.

19
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.800
We're going to do the same thing.

20
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.250
We're going to show you how this map really simplifies your analysis and really allows you to get a

21
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.630
nice core understanding of what's going on in special relativity.

22
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.700
What exactly are we going to do?

23
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:03.320
We're going to tackle the last a topic in special relativity, at least for this course in which we

24
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.530
try to figure out how different perceptions of velocity give rise to different phenomena.

25
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.920
OK.

26
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.490
So, for example, this happens in everyday situations, right?

27
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.800
If you're in a car and somebody is standing on the land and you drive by, then you have another car

28
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.460
in front of you.

29
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.710
If that car is going faster, let's say you're going 50 and somebody else is going 60 miles per hour

30
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.330
to you in the car.

31
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.660
It may look like the dude in front of you is going at a speed of 10 miles per hour, but the individual

32
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.120
on the ground what he sees as the actual speed 60 miles per hour.

33
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.640
OK, so the Galilean transformation, the classical interpretation had this nice map for actually figuring

34
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.520
out what that is and relating those experiences.

35
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.700
This is known as the Galilean transformation, but we visited the same problem previously in the beginning

36
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.180
of the course.

37
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.260
Do you recall in the beginning of the course, I use this situation, this scenario, to spell out the

38
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.050
problems associated with the classical approach.

39
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.960
In essence, we worked with Terence to fill up in the experiment that's outlined here.

40
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.690
And what happened was Terence.

41
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.910
He was in a ship that was speeding to the right in the positive direction at a speed of zero point nine,

42
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.710
five times the speed of light, see?

43
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.910
And he shot a laser beam that shot, you know, photons and particles that went, obviously, as we

44
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.900
know from the second postulate, a special relativity, the speed of light, see?

45
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.680
Now, according to the Galilean transformation Philip, what he saw previously is he said, Oh, I've

46
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.570
got this relation in classical mechanics.

47
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.250
It says that my velocity, my perceived interpretation of the velocity p is just Terrence's perceive

48
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.000
velocity of prime, plus the relative velocity point, I see.

49
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.030
So if you take all those details together, that would lead fill up to say that, hey, to me, that

50
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.770
light is going to travel at a speed of 1.9 five times C, which obviously is wrong because in essence,

51
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.990
what he's going to see is and what we found in that video is he's going to see that this light travels

52
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.290
at well, it's not surprising the speed of light, right?

53
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.470
So what went wrong with this and how can we use this map to resolve that problem?

54
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.060
That's what we're going to do in this video, but you should be able to tell me what exactly went wrong

55
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.480
with this.

56
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.050
And the problem is, as you tell right here, this failed to account for the second postulate special

57
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.860
relativity, right?

58
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:41.420
When we derive the Galilean transformation, it was just a regular kinematic interpretation, and they

59
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.930
did not.

60
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.420
Mold the equations, they do not mold their interpretation, so they enforced the second postulate a

61
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.350
special relativity.

62
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.900
And as we know now, when you do that, it gives rise to special phenomena such as time dilation and

63
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.980
length contraction.

64
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:04.930
And with the Galilean transformation, we just assumed that the time T is equal to T prime that that

65
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.910
there was no difference between time.

66
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:14.290
That time flows at a constant rate, regardless of your reference frame, your perspective, your perception

67
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.000
of the universe.

68
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.380
OK, so that was fundamentally wrong.

69
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.190
That was flawed.

70
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.670
And when you observe things, close the speed of light.

71
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:30.150
That gets pushed out straight into the equation, and it starts to diverge away from what it actually

72
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.430
is, what actually happens in the universe, and that's why this guy was wrong.

73
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.210
Now to resolve this, what we can do, it's pretty straightforward.

74
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.910
And this is why I'm saying that it's really going to unleash the power that's inherent in the lunch

75
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.690
transformation.

76
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.250
All you have to do is take a look at the velocities and apply our map, right?

77
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.140
We can easily relate lengths.

78
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.270
We can easily relate times.

79
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.140
Let's do that right now.

80
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.000
OK, so we're going to revolve your lips and has this problem.

81
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.680
Fill up is freaking out.

82
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.070
Is, you know, he's pretty happy because he's shooting a laser beam.

83
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.020
And that's frickin awesome.

84
00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:12.060
OK, so we put a line here to separate our Lorentz transformation and the work we're going to do.

85
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.480
What we can do is we could take a look at the definition of laxity, and that's going to be our blueprint.

86
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.780
That's going to be what drives us forward in this analysis.

87
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:28.200
So what we know is that the velocity in any reference frame, regardless of how you perceive it is your

88
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.910
velocity is no different.

89
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.620
Then you know, it's a derivative, right?

90
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:43.260
Basic physics one on one B, this is just d x d, or if you want to make this more complete in every

91
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:50.760
direction, you can use a position Vector R, which includes Dimensions X, Y and Z and the Cartesian

92
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.510
reference frame.

93
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:59.790
We say this velocity is nothing more than this, and this is just going to be valid where D.R. is the

94
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.880
distance, the change in distance between two points.

95
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.050
Right.

96
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:05.460
This is between.

97
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.940
Or rather, we can use an equal sign.

98
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:14.190
TR is no more than an hour to minus R one.

99
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.020
Right.

100
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:19.020
It's the difference between an event at point two and an event at zero point one.

101
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.550
Take the difference of their distance that gives you the change in your life.

102
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.760
Right.

103
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.090
So this is nothing more than a change in length of the change in time.

104
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.080
But what's interesting is I make some board space here.

105
00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:37.080
We can relate V and V Prime pretty easily because, well, we can take these guys right here.

106
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.330
What's really cool is the Lorenz transformation is linear.

107
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.580
I'm going to see that again.

108
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.090
The Lorenz transformation is linear, right?

109
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:55.130
So what we find is that if you have an operator on one of these guys is going to get carried through.

110
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.620
So you know what, d x prime right?

111
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:59.940
This this is a constant.

112
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.610
It's linear, you know, if you take the derivative.

113
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.370
You're there to get Delta X Prize is equal to Ghana.

114
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.800
Delta X minus B Relative D.

115
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.710
That's because it's linear, right?

116
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.110
Linearity is something that occurs when you only have a constant multiply by your variable.

117
00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:21.450
So we're going to take advantage of that right now to actually resolve this problem pretty quickly.

118
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.620
And we're going to let the math do this for us.

119
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:33.300
OK, so we could have this guy and we can relate these guys by saying, Oh, wait a second, the prime

120
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.400
is nothing more then.

121
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.050
Well, that's d.r prime.

122
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.380
The key problem and we're going to constrain what we look at for now on one dimension.

123
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:49.140
So we're going to assume that we have a situation where terrorism fill up are speeding along in one

124
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.370
direction, and we're going to take a look at Delta ex-Prime over that.

125
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.950
Well, what is Delta Prime?

126
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:03.690
Normally we would use this guy here, and this gave us problems because it didn't account for the second

127
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.190
possible special relativity.

128
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:11.120
The speed of light is always constant, but we have that embedded in this nice, powerful map that allows

129
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.350
the translate experiences, right?

130
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.460
So we don't have to think about it.

131
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:16.610
We just need a plug and chug in essence.

132
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.040
So what we could do is we can determine both of these parameters.

133
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.440
All we have to do is we just say, OK, the prime is, Oh, it's linear.

134
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.910
We write down this baby.

135
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.660
We get a delta account.

136
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.390
The whole wrench factor right there.

137
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:42.380
That's literally just Delta X minus B relative d c simple baby.

138
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.260
We can do the same thing with the prime data.

139
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.910
Manage linearity, right?

140
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.620
And if this does not sit well with you, you can literally just say yes.

141
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.060
Try it, try it and you can.

142
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.080
You can prove linearity yourself.

143
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:56.580
You can say yes.

144
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.570
Prime is no different than Oh, that's x to prime minus x one prime.

145
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:07.710
And you're going to find that if you take X to prime and subtract x one prime, you can group these

146
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.400
guys put that guy in.

147
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.490
You get the same exact result.

148
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.910
OK.

149
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:17.220
I'm sort of jumping ahead a bit, assuming you guys have done basic algebra and you understand this

150
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:17.910
interpretation.

151
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.800
But if you don't make sure you go through that exercise, convince yourself and be confident in the

152
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:29.010
math that your confidence and your mathematical ability puts the results forward and guide what you're

153
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.340
doing.

154
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:37.290
So this becomes nothing more than the T minus B relative over C squared times.

155
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.040
D Yes.

156
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.670
All right.

157
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.190
So we got these guys and literally all we need to do is just plug them into this relationship.

158
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:50.070
It was that easy, and we can resolve this paradox without any headaches, any kind of problems.

159
00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.570
Let's do that right now.

160
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.840
OK.

161
00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:02.910
So in the X direction v x prime just becomes nothing more than the X Prime or DC Prime.

162
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.170
And what we do is we just slap these guys straight on.

163
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.830
We get a gamma a d x minus the relative DC.

164
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.670
We divide by the prime.

165
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:31.910
Gamma times, the T minus the relative over C squared times the X and what we do is we can cancel all

166
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.260
these gamma factors.

167
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.720
And what we're going to say is we're going to divide by ADT on the top and bottom.

168
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.520
So in essence, we're just multiplying by one.

169
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.230
We take this guy multiply one over DC, over one over DC.

170
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.200
Bam, we distribute this guy.

171
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.250
What ends up equaling is, well, DC's over DC.

172
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.840
Or I'm going to slow down.

173
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.790
I'm going to write this off for you guys so you can see it.

174
00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.670
So we get DST.

175
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:12.070
Minus the relative times, dirty over, Dirty Old West is one and only divide by D over T minus the

176
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:16.750
relative overseas squared times.

177
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:25.540
The Act's over 80 now, if you get rid of this erroneous approach with the galley and transformation

178
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:31.360
because it's useless, it gave us the wrong results and we make room for the new result, which is what

179
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.830
we want the correct result.

180
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:39.340
We end up with nothing more than, Oh, let's just V.X, these guys cancel out just one.

181
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.800
This guy cancels out just to be one.

182
00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.780
You get a right there.

183
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:50.800
And what you end up with is the following the X minus the relative.

184
00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:06.140
Divided by one minus the relative, the overseas squared times Vieques and is the point where I check

185
00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:13.010
my notes to make sure we did the math correctly and we did at this point, we say That's awesome, we

186
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.510
have achieved victory.

187
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:22.640
That is the result we want and this is known as the relativistic velocity.

188
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.740
Audition, OK.

189
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.820
So what we see is pretty cool.

190
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.870
We see that.

191
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.360
Well, using this nap, we extended it a bit.

192
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.730
Now we have a map to relate velocities.

193
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.110
We can further translate experiences.

194
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:48.350
This extends the power and you can see there is unlimited untapped potential instilled in this derivation

195
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.280
that we put together.

196
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:55.880
OK, so at this point, we say, OK, we got the result in the X direction.

197
00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:57.200
Let's call it a day.

198
00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.710
No, we are not going to do that.

199
00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.210
Why?

200
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:06.670
Well, as we found previously, relativistic effects have mostly been constrained to the axis of motion.

201
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.850
What am I talking about there?

202
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:15.110
If we have something traveling in the extraction close to the speed of light, we find that it's constrained

203
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.530
in that same x direction in the x axis.

204
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:25.400
And it also affects what I'm going to refer to as like a fourth dimension the time where I'm related

205
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.120
to space time.

206
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:33.290
So usually we would have the length contract and then the X direction and Y and Z would not be affected,

207
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.590
right?

208
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.550
That seemed to be the general convection.

209
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:43.160
But that does not necessarily dictate that it always will be constrained to the axis of motion.

210
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:48.470
So it's a worthwhile exercise to go through this and see what happens.

211
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.590
And perhaps v y ABC is by.

212
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.580
It's going to be v why is the Z Prime is going to be busy?

213
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.310
We don't necessarily know, and that's not assume that right?

214
00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.430
Remember how tears of Philip fill their experiment.

215
00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:07.730
They failed it because they tried to prescribe what would happen upon the universe, as opposed to taking

216
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:13.010
a step back, looking, observing, taking it in and then derived the results.

217
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.840
Let's see what nature dictates.

218
00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.490
Let's see what the math pops up for us.

219
00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:25.370
OK, so if we take v y prime o v y prime, we just do the same exact exercise.

220
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:31.400
This is nothing more than taking up d y prime.

221
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.860
Or Team Prime?

222
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:41.180
And what I want you to do is I want you to look at this relationship and you should tell me whether

223
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:46.910
it's going to have a very odd result, whether it's going to be different than what we see here, right?

224
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.750
We're not going to have by prime equal to be why right?

225
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.660
Can you see that?

226
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.010
If not, let's see.

227
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.210
Well, we know that there's no change in life because of the constraints of the x axis.

228
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.490
So DUI prime is nothing more than, you know, that's DUI.

229
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.920
Nothing really changed here.

230
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.700
OK.

231
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:11.180
But we know that time dilates right.

232
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.850
So deep prime, it's going to change.

233
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.060
But we have that spell out for us right here so we can make way.

234
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.580
So we see it is not going to be constrained to the x axis these relativistic effects.

235
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:25.400
Let's see what they are in the U, Y and z axis.

236
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.280
So all we have to do is we literally come here.

237
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.980
We use our map right up here.

238
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.320
DUI prime equals DUI.

239
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.960
We write that baby right up there and we divide by this guy right here.

240
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.530
That's nothing more than our, you know, we get our gamma factor.

241
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:50.160
Right in there and then we get this guy right up here.

242
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.790
Minus the relative or a C squared.

243
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.820
And that is multiplied by X the X.

244
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:09.880
All right, so the name of the game is we do the same exact thing we did up here for Vice Prime.

245
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.800
What we're going to do is we're going to multiply by 130 over a 180.

246
00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:21.470
And I'm not going to write it out like it did here, because you can see you're going to get DUI disease

247
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.060
or, oh, what do we get?

248
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.560
We get?

249
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.570
We get the wine.

250
00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:30.550
Is equal to you.

251
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.570
Here we get a gamma ray.

252
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.180
He gives you a one.

253
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:45.600
And then we subtract the relative overseas squared times the X.

254
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:47.820
Right.

255
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:51.170
OK, so that's the prime.

256
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.060
Bam, OK.

257
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.880
And we could do the same exercise with fizzy.

258
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.180
I'm going to skip that because it should be evident what's going to happen, right?

259
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:16.020
We get it easy prime up here over prime and in essence, all it happens is instead of a DUI, you get

260
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.570
a DC up here, so you're going to get a visa on the top.

261
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:23.250
On the bottom is unchanged and you get the same exact relation on the bottom.

262
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.580
We can write this off by a metaphor.

263
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.230
So this just becomes.

264
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:30.410
Visit.

265
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.100
Over Gamma.

266
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:38.890
One minus the relative.

267
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.620
Over C squared.

268
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.560
On the X.

269
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.120
Boom.

270
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.140
The end result.

271
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:58.480
So we find that relativistic effects are not constrained to the axis of motion, which is a little weird

272
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:05.350
and makes our calculations a bit more complicated, but we have this nice map which gives us additional

273
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:08.860
analytical power on top of the Lorentz transformation.

274
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.780
What we want to do now to wrap up this portion of the video is make some board space.

275
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.910
And make note that

276
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.840
for the relativistic lost the edition, just like we did up here.

277
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:33.360
For the civil rights transformation that these are, in essence, interchangeable maps, you can go

278
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.020
either way.

279
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.400
Yes, you can do the same thing down here for these guys.

280
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:49.020
These last edition formulas, in order to get, oh, I forgot a pry up there in order to get a relationship

281
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.800
or V.X for basically the terms and Philip's reference frame the stationary record's frame without the

282
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.280
prime.

283
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.350
Right?

284
00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:05.950
All you need to do is switch out the signs of the V relative, switch the signs and let the prime.

285
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.900
What am I talking about here?

286
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.790
Let's get out of it.

287
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.920
Let's look at the Lorentz transformation we see here.

288
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.430
All we needed to do is we flip this guide here and these guys get primed and then you just change this,

289
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.770
right?

290
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:25.040
See, it's from one to two exploded over here, and then we change the sign and then ban same exact

291
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.360
convention for Prime.

292
00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:33.720
You know, this guy gets thrown over here and here, that gesture to a positive bam.

293
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.800
Obviously, you want to work through this once before you do this, but the special relativity, this

294
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.200
is a convention that will be mentioned in many textbooks across up again and again, and the same exact

295
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.250
thing applies the the.

296
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.490
So yeah, you could do this.

297
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.580
You could just push through that guy over on the right side.

298
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.350
Change that to a positive sign.

299
00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:54.790
You're in good shape.

300
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.090
You got the inverse of lost ED. formula.

301
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:04.210
Now, the last thing I want to do is take a look at the following.

302
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:04.990
So.

303
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:12.850
If this this relationship was true, then it should apply a very high velocities.

304
00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:19.570
But at the same time, just as we saw at the Lawrence transformation, it should converge upon the classical

305
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.080
result.

306
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.530
Otherwise, there would be something wrong with this guy.

307
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:30.550
So let's show that in the way in which we share that if we take the limit as V is much less than C,

308
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:38.500
or let's see, we're going to stay the limit as V is much less than C.

309
00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:45.930
And that means we over see is much less than one.

310
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.260
So we do that and I pop up my notes.

311
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.880
What happens is.

312
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.960
We know are the rent factor, the Ghana.

313
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.850
Approximately one, because again, that's one over square root.

314
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:08.910
Mine is B or C, the sky squared, the yes, that is right.

315
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:15.050
So when this guy is small, just becomes one because we ever see a small one might assume because nothing

316
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.240
more than one and then one by one is one.

317
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.470
OK, so.

318
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:27.670
We get this relationship and what happens to Vieques, Vieques, is because nothing more than a promise

319
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:31.480
equal to Vieques, minus the relative.

320
00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:38.970
Over one minus the relative or a C squared times the X.

321
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:45.780
Well, all these parameters, the velocities are much less than C and supplies for, you know, the

322
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.160
relative acts, et cetera.

323
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.710
Right.

324
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.930
We're assuming we're going to operate in Newtonian fashion.

325
00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:01.410
OK, so this guy is essentially zero because the relative is much smaller than C squared.

326
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.280
And it doesn't matter if you multiply by B X because that's small, too.

327
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:08.160
So this guy is small relative to this guy.

328
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.780
And what you end up with is not surprisingly, the classical result.

329
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.280
Exactly what we wanted, right?

330
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:23.070
This is the same relationship that we observed in getting the video down here, when Fill-Up screwed

331
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.720
up everything and thought that this was going to travel them faster than the speed of light, that's

332
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.850
an oxymoron that doesn't even make any sense.

333
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.660
It's contradicted.

334
00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:32.470
Very that's not true.

335
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.760
So yes, that jisoo of our intuition.

336
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.620
That's good.

337
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:40.650
The next thing we want to check is the why.

338
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.100
How does that behave?

339
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.990
How does it behave?

340
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:48.300
So if we take the why and do the same exact trick me why?

341
00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:50.350
And let me back up a bit.

342
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:55.000
The gamma is gone here because actually there is no gamma.

343
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.750
Sorry about that.

344
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.140
There was a gamut up here, but don't worry about that.

345
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.150
So and that's what we have is.

346
00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:17.020
VI Prime is equal to the one over gamaa times, one minus the relative or C squared times the X, and

347
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.930
we know that this guy is very small compared to one.

348
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.430
So this becomes zero.

349
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.370
This guy is approximately equal to one.

350
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.780
And what we find is Bam.

351
00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.360
No, no relativistic effects.

352
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.780
We find out it doesn't change if it's going up, regardless of your mention, it's going to go up at

353
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.710
the same rate.

354
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:41.510
That is the last school result.

355
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.500
We would have gotten the same exact thing for Visa also, because this becomes one.

356
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:51.020
This guy is essentially zero B.C. prime equals visa ban.

357
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.740
It converges upon the classical result at a low velocity.

358
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.070
This must be the correct result.

359
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.660
OK, so what have we done in this video?

360
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:08.870
We really want to tap the magic, the inherent power that's instilled in the Lorentz transformation

361
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:14.510
right when we run into problems, dilemmas such as that observed with Phillip and Terence.

362
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:22.160
We can hearken back to this nice map, this nice translational tool, and it can resolve those paradoxes

363
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.700
or discrepancies very easily and effortlessly, and in doing so, we came up with a new map, a map

364
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:36.170
that can allow us to relate the losses, as seen by different perspectives and the experiences that

365
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.960
arise in those reference frames can be related.

366
00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:40.640
They can talk about it intelligently.

367
00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.600
We have a universal conception of the universe.

368
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:50.360
Next, what we're going to do is we're going to run through a quick example to show you how not only

369
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.720
this resolves the paradox with parents and fill up, and also that it conforms to the second possible

370
00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:58.730
special relativity.

371
00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.850
Well, we'll take a look at another interesting example to demonstrate the power of this and get you

372
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:10.220
used to actually doing computations with the Velocity Edition formulas.

373
00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:11.570
Stay tuned.
