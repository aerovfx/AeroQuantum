00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.280
Now, if this is truly the correct relativistic velocity edition formula, what we should be able to

2
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:31.990
do is use it to reconcile the dilemma and problem which Terrance and Phillip have illustrated in the

3
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.130
beginning of this course.

4
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.230
So what I'm going to do in this video is I'm going to run through that and show you that if Terrence

5
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.170
CC, then this map dictates that look should also CC.

6
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.290
And that is because it was derived from first principles from the second postulate special relativity,

7
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.060
which states that what is it?

8
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.360
It states that the speed of light is always constant.

9
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.490
It's a constant value of C.

10
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.060
So let's run through that, OK, if it's correct, it should yield that expected value should conform

11
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.680
to the laws of the Universe.

12
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.290
And that will not only increase our confidence in this map, we just arrived, but will give you some

13
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.280
experience in taking this and doing some computations.

14
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.200
Now, as you have noted, or as you can note in the map I have here at the Lawrence Transformation,

15
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.040
I've added the Velocity Edition formulas in both ways, going both ways.

16
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.970
I'm going to utilize this throughout the calculations that we do in this problem.

17
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.680
So what we know is that parents shoot the laser from his spaceship and he identifies that, not surprisingly,

18
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.450
it's traveling at the speed of light.

19
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.850
See if he's going at a speed point nine, five, three times the speed of light.

20
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.840
Our task is to figure out what fuel up it's going to see.

21
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.750
He's trying to preconceived what's going to happen by doing his calculation and using his awesome physics

22
00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.530
skills.

23
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.280
OK.

24
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.810
So in order to do this, you know, in the Galilean transformation, we would just add these guys up

25
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.970
together and we got the erroneous result at one.

26
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.550
They obviously can't be true.

27
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.560
Let's see how good this new Relativistic Velocity Edition formula is.

28
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.060
So what we're going to do, and I'm gonna put my notebook down right here, we're going to take this

29
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.540
guy here because we're interested in Philip's interpretation.

30
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.600
We already know a V.X Brian is, and I'm going to write this down.

31
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.780
So we become consistent and you know, it's a record of what we're actually stating.

32
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.210
So we know that Antares is reference for that.

33
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:41.680
He measured his laser light as see, which is not surprising because again, it's light, and we know

34
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.260
that every relative is nothing more than zero point nine five C. Now we can see the power of this map

35
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.150
of this translation at all.

36
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.760
All you need to do is just throw straight into the map.

37
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.910
It throws out a result, and that allows us to talk about this event in a way that lines up between

38
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.240
these two perspectives.

39
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
OK, so what we're going to do is we're shooting in V.X.

40
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:13.480
Here we take the V.X formula, which is no different than V.X prime, plus the relative.

41
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:25.090
And we follow that by one plus v relative over C squared times v x prime.

42
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.540
OK.

43
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.380
And all we need to do is we got these guys which were on the right side.

44
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.460
If we fill them in and resolve our problem, that will yield our result that we're looking for.

45
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.340
So let's just do that.

46
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.600
Let's plug in shot b.

47
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.610
V.X, prime is no different.

48
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.280
Then see, we add on VE Relative, which is zero point nine five C.

49
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.250
And we get that result that we see in the galley and transformation, but it's going to be modified

50
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.850
by this term here, which accounts for which is not surprising because, you know, the access decks

51
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.440
over eat that derivative.

52
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.130
This portion on the bottom is for the time we know it dilates.

53
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.960
So that's going to scale this back to try and force the second postulate a special relativity.

54
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.040
Let's see.

55
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.280
So this is just one plus what is b relevant?

56
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.260
All that 0.9 percent.

57
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.910
And then we divide by C squared and multiply by B prime, which is no more than C.

58
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.260
So these guys combined to cancel out the C square on the bottom.

59
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:38.460
And what we end up with is one point nine five C, divided by one point nine five, just no.

60
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.060
And not surprisingly, this is a good result.

61
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.290
We get the value of C.

62
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.440
OK.

63
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.080
So as you can see, what happens is he fires like he sees the light speed of light.

64
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.400
And Philip calculates that it's also going to go the speed of light.

65
00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.680
So, you know, using the Galilean transformation, he was freaking out, but now he's super, frickin

66
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.150
happy.

67
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.690
Put a smile on his face.

68
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.340
Life is good.

69
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.010
So this guy's well for intuition.

70
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.920
This agrees with the second postulate of special relativity and allows us to enforce that principle.

71
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.140
I talked about many video videos ago.

72
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.700
Where do not?

73
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.520
We don't want to dictate how the universe behaves.

74
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.950
Rather, we want to take a step back, observe what happens, namely that the speed of light is constant

75
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.130
and then use that to dictate our predictions, dictate our results and dictate the laws and formulas

76
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.990
that fall out of our observation.

77
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.900
So we're good with this map here.

78
00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.940
It's giving us the good result we want.

79
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:47.930
I'm going to expand upon this example just a little bit to show you how it really exerts the second

80
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.150
positive special relativity, how conforms to reality conforms to what we expect to happen.

81
00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:03.050
So if this relationship is true, then what we're going to find is we should not be able to get V.X

82
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:11.000
or prime to exceed the speed of light and really just show that this formula capsid.

83
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.780
We're going to do is on the state that on the state the following, what we know is that from the second

84
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:25.190
populous special relativity, we take this guy here, you know, V.X, prime is less than see.

85
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:32.050
And the relative has to be less than see, nothing can go faster than the speed of light.

86
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:40.660
There, what this formula dictates is it's going to say, OK, the X is equal o vice prime plus the

87
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:48.610
relative over one plus the relative over C squared.

88
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:57.190
The X, from what we can say is that, well, this has to be less than what it yields for these maximum

89
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.730
values.

90
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:04.480
Because if this is zero, if the X prime, if you're also four zero zero four zero zero divide by one

91
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.350
plus zero.

92
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.280
That's nothing more than zero.

93
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.900
OK, so if that is the lower cap, the high cap of V.X has to be when these guys are maxed out.

94
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:18.330
That's how it's going to be.

95
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.730
So what we can say is a V.X.

96
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:29.590
Well, this is always less than let's put in the maximum value because, you know, V.X, price must

97
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.080
be less than sees that this would be the maximum value there.

98
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.150
The relative has to be less than 30.

99
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:40.690
So that guy goes up in there and then we divide by one plus c overseas squared times.

100
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.060
See all these guys cancel out.

101
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.950
We get nothing more than to see over two.

102
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:54.040
And that is see which states that V.X also has to be less fancy.

103
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:54.760
So.

104
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.570
You're right through this example, we showed one little example in which this is enforced.

105
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.640
But in totality, regardless of what our role philosophy is in our prime.

106
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:11.040
What these guys are, we're always going to find that the absurd velocity, according to this Formula

107
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.130
E is going to be less than C. No matter what that conforms to the second part of the special relativity.

108
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.540
Not surprising, because that's what's driving the rand's transformation.

109
00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.140
That's the base.

110
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.700
That's the foundational support.

111
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.670
Remember, time dilation and length contraction that fell out of the second part of the special relativity?

112
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.190
That's the basis for all this.

113
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.390
That's why I've posted that.

114
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:38.160
So we ran through this and we see images well, for intuition.

115
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:41.880
That's good for any kind of physical theory, as I've mentioned before.

116
00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:48.420
But you know what, our favorite scientist parents and fill up, they're not happy either freaking out.

117
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.190
They're like, Oh, I can't trust all this from one experiment, I got to do another one.

118
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.620
So what they do is they take this expensive laser.

119
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.930
They they say, Oh yeah, maybe this result is popping out because we use light.

120
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.950
So it's sort of performing like, let's do another experiment.

121
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:10.170
So they take this little laser device, they drop it off and let it fly into the sun.

122
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.740
And waste millions of dollars, but they don't care.

123
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:21.430
And they say, Oh, I'm just going to fire a missile instead as missiles are pretty frickin awesome.

124
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.290
So they shoot a missile off.

125
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:28.410
You know, this guy comes in and we got this megaton missile as nice frickin fins.

126
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.020
And I say, oh, that's not because the speed of light we're going to say, let's say.

127
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.570
Let's see, Terence observes it, and it goes zero point six.

128
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:45.000
And the speed of light.

129
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:52.110
OK, so where do this experiment of this comes out and agrees with our intuition that maybe this theory

130
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.930
is correct, but what they know is that from the Galilean transformation that would have predicted that

131
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:04.920
V X is equal to v v x prime plus the relative.

132
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:16.800
And what that says is that V.X, Pride is zero point six C, plus the relative, which is zero point

133
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:27.720
nine five C, and that would give us the result of 1.5 five C, which is wrong.

134
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.410
So if we take this formula and throw all this information in, it should give us the correct result.

135
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.250
I did just prove that we left the speed of light, which, you know, I tend to fall for a little slow

136
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.860
there, playing around too much.

137
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.850
So they want to be more confident in what they're doing.

138
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:47.950
And this gives you another opportunity to employ the formula, right used to doing these calculations.

139
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.120
So what we need to do a similar fashion.

140
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.380
We know that v prime v x prime is this guy, and I'll just write it down.

141
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.260
Or, you know, I'll I'll write it down.

142
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:06.630
V x Prime is equal to zero point six C, as observed by Terrance and V relative.

143
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:13.440
Again, it's still very close to the speed of light 0.95 C, so we would expect relativistic effects

144
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.350
to come into play where it diverges from the classical result and we need to do is literally plug and

145
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:20.010
chug baby.

146
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:20.940
It's that simple.

147
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.790
So we take the map out and this is why it's so powerful.

148
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:30.600
We take the map, we write down literally the translational formula, which states that v x is equal

149
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:38.430
to v x prime again, right up here, right from our handy dandy equation sheet on the board plus v relative

150
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.700
divided by one laws.

151
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:51.630
The relative divided by C squared times, V.X, Prime, and what we plug in should throw these these

152
00:11:51.630 --> 00:12:00.120
numbers in, we got zero point six for V.X prime time C plus B relative again zero point nine five.

153
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:12.530
We divide by one would be relative 0.9 five C, divided by C squared that's multiplied by V.X.

154
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.760
Prime, we get this guy right here.

155
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.740
We throw that guy in.

156
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.020
We put in a 0.6.

157
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.170
See the CS cancel BAM.

158
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.010
What do we get to do that I need to pick up my notebook.

159
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.660
I don't have a calculator on me.

160
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.280
See what I did previously.

161
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.290
And you end up with is the following.

162
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.130
So this guy is equal to, well, this is just, oh, I can do that addition to my head.

163
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:49.230
That's one point five five C. Divided by one plus point nine five times six, that ends up being one

164
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.400
point five seven.

165
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:55.200
And as you should know already, this should not be surprising.

166
00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:01.710
The end result is nothing more than zero point nine eight seven.

167
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.340
Uh, time, see?

168
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.000
Yup.

169
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:14.030
So Vieques is the following, so we do get some velocity or speed added on from what Terrence observes.

170
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:20.150
But the mechanism is in place, so it constrains it such that it does not go faster than the speed of

171
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.480
light.

172
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.300
This guy is conforming to reality.

173
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.940
It's conforming to what we would expect to fill up the smiles on the faces.

174
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:29.630
They're happy.

175
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.710
All is good.

176
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.960
We got this nice translational formula.

177
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:39.680
So to recap, what have we really done by taking this and combining it with the Lorenz transformation,

178
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:48.020
we were able to, uh, bridge the gap between an infinite set of perceptions of the universe.

179
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:54.560
This allows us to get a nice translational tool where we can take anybody's experience the way in which

180
00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.020
actions or events transpire in any kind of perspective, any kind of reference frame.

181
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:05.390
And we can relate them easily and effortlessly, such that we can have an intelligible conversation

182
00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:05.780
about it.

183
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.600
We can have this universal conception of the universe and life is good.

184
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.950
So to this point, we've been talking about kinematic ideas with special relativity.

185
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.890
Now that we have this baseball on a plate, it's nice map.

186
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:24.200
Uh, nice effects, relativistic effects, time deletion, length, contraction.

187
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.050
Moreover, do you want to take a look at one other idea known as the Doppler effect, how that gets

188
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.240
affected by relativistic effects?

189
00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:38.810
And then we're going to take a look at other ideas in Newtonian mechanics and see how that's affected,

190
00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:43.120
such as momentum, energy and forces.

191
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:43.460
OK?

192
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.990
I hope you enjoyed this section.

193
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:46.010
I hope it was fun.

194
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.420
I hope it was enlightening.

195
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.920
I hope I blew your mind.

196
00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:57.170
Stay tuned as we jump further down the rabbit hole and discover the beautiful wonders of special relativity.
