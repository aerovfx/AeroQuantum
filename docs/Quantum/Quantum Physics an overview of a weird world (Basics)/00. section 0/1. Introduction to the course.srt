00:01.350 --> 00:04.380
In this introductory lecture, let me.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.860
Set the stage, so to speak.

00:08.100 --> 00:16.890
Let me give you an understanding of what the spirit is of this cause, and that stands behind my effort

00:16.890 --> 00:25.500
to build a larger and more comprehensive introduction to quantum physics, because the problem is that

00:25.500 --> 00:32.880
nowadays there are many there are already many popular books, textbooks and online courses teaching

00:32.880 --> 00:36.780
your quantum physics for undergraduates and graduates.

00:36.780 --> 00:42.430
There are many well written textbooks that elucidate every conceivable aspect of quantum mechanics.

00:43.530 --> 00:48.230
Additionally, at the popular science level, a lot of books are no longer missing either.

00:48.780 --> 00:50.010
So that's not a problem.

00:51.480 --> 00:57.720
The point is, however, that on one side, they are treatises that require the reader to have a quite

00:57.720 --> 00:59.380
good background in mathematics.

01:00.090 --> 01:06.360
One cannot go very far with university level textbooks if the basics of at least calculus and linear

01:06.360 --> 01:12.990
algebra, as well as many concepts from classical mechanics, are not reasonably grasped by the student.

01:14.070 --> 01:19.020
Moreover, most of these sources are mainly concerned with the calculations and the purely technical

01:19.020 --> 01:20.370
aspects of quantum mechanics.

01:20.370 --> 01:27.600
While a deeper understanding of the more foundational implications are given on these kinds of tensions,

01:27.720 --> 01:31.320
they usually tend to believe it is a waste of time.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.620
He instead I will.

01:35.720 --> 01:42.290
Proceed in this course in a very technical manner, but at the same time giving also a lot of attention

01:42.290 --> 01:49.910
to more conceptual understanding of the philosophical implications of the nature of reality, so to

01:49.910 --> 01:50.330
speak.

01:51.470 --> 01:58.250
Contrary to popular belief, most physicists are not at all concerned with philosophical foundations

01:58.250 --> 02:06.290
of quantum theory, but are much more focused on doing calculations, the process of which can obscure

02:06.290 --> 02:09.740
and hide the deeper meaning and nature of the physical phenomenon.

02:09.770 --> 02:17.690
The math describes there's somehow this misunderstanding that if you understand the math, the mathematical

02:17.840 --> 02:23.120
concepts that describe reality, you have the most profound understanding of social reality.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.700
And that's only partially true.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.560
This is only one phase of the reality if you don't.

02:31.610 --> 02:38.070
Dig deeper in the foundations of the things you are studying.

02:38.090 --> 02:41.990
You still lack something on the other side.

02:42.600 --> 02:50.390
That's also another point that of those who are looking for an introductory introduction, more at the

02:50.390 --> 02:51.860
popular level.

02:52.340 --> 02:59.360
There is nowadays also an extensive body of literature and online videos for the audience that does

02:59.360 --> 03:04.650
not have the authentic background and does not intend to become a professional physicist.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.090
However, unfortunately and here this is the other side of the coin.

03:10.370 --> 03:20.450
Unfortunately, most of this popular science dwells on a surface or worse, falls into pseudoscientific

03:20.450 --> 03:29.300
ruminations where the author wants to impress the audience with extravagant and misleading theories

03:29.720 --> 03:31.460
or even false statements.

03:32.900 --> 03:38.710
All of this is especially true when it comes to some of the philosophical aspects of quantum mechanics.

03:39.650 --> 03:47.600
Most of these books, some written even by qualified and well-known physicist, reduce the concepts

03:47.600 --> 03:54.710
to such a low level that paradoxically, they become unclear and difficult to understand just because

03:55.670 --> 03:58.790
they treat their readers like babies.

04:00.290 --> 04:07.760
Moreover, lots of bestselling books or science documentaries promote, so to speak.

04:08.810 --> 04:17.690
To put it mildly, a highly dubious ideas and speculations that are backed by no evidence, sometimes

04:18.200 --> 04:26.090
coming out with theories and ideas, selling them as verified scientific truths which are not and which

04:26.090 --> 04:30.380
can't be verified experimentally, not even in principle.

04:30.890 --> 04:36.980
And and also they try to sell you theories that already have not worked out.

04:38.450 --> 04:47.120
This seemingly pedagogical approach of many popular vulgarised versions of quantum mechanics, in my

04:47.120 --> 04:54.320
opinion, has done more harm than good and ended up in misleading the audience regarding the real nature

04:54.320 --> 04:55.490
of the quantum world.

04:56.910 --> 05:03.590
Therefore, there is a missing link between, on one side, the professional, fully mathematics, the

05:03.600 --> 05:11.160
exposition of the principles of quantum mechanics, and that which is accessible to a broader audience,

05:11.310 --> 05:15.740
but ends up leaving them with doubtful insights.

05:16.710 --> 05:23.910
The net result is that nowadays we have a scientific community on one side that is busy with a plethora

05:23.910 --> 05:30.150
of calculations, but has lost contact with a more profound understanding of its own foundations.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.120
I that's what I say here.

05:33.150 --> 05:45.070
Even physicists are too lost in their business in doing business as usual on the other side.

05:45.090 --> 05:52.080
The public has in its mind a cartoon version of one of the most fascinating subjects of modern science.

05:52.260 --> 05:53.520
But it is a cartoon version.

05:53.530 --> 05:57.030
It is something that does not exist in reality.

05:58.740 --> 06:07.680
Whereas with this course, I would like to bridge this gap between a merely mathematical exposition

06:08.580 --> 06:16.020
and a too simplistic popular version of quantum physics by presenting an overview of the basic concepts

06:16.020 --> 06:22.500
that stand behind non relativistic quantum theory, with an emphasis on experimental and technical facts

06:22.770 --> 06:28.860
that should prepare you to correctly understand, first and foremost, its foundations with particular

06:28.860 --> 06:32.880
attention paid to its philosophical implications.

06:34.170 --> 06:37.620
However, this led me also to a dilemma.

06:38.280 --> 06:44.100
Just because there are so many possible interpretations, it is impossible to create a full fledged

06:44.100 --> 06:54.380
course and to write a book on quantum physics, taking a perfectly objective and agnostic stance, a

06:54.390 --> 07:01.770
sort of agnostic in the sense of the interpretation of quantum physics interpretations I mean stance

07:01.980 --> 07:11.810
while not letting one's own point of view, subjective preferences and interpretations slip through.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.280
It's impossible.

07:14.070 --> 07:19.890
The quantum world is so weird that everyone sees something different in it.

07:20.700 --> 07:29.220
I will therefore not hide my preference for a quantum theory that is interpreted as a non-deterministic

07:29.220 --> 07:38.430
theory without hidden variables, and that does not admit counterfactual definiteness as a logical inference

07:38.430 --> 07:38.760
tool.

07:39.630 --> 07:44.400
OK, if this statement has confused you, don't worry.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.550
We will discuss this in detail during the lectures.

07:49.290 --> 07:55.320
This might not satisfy those who support the opposite point of view, where quantum mechanics is envisaged

07:55.440 --> 08:03.450
as a deterministic theory with hidden variables, especially those who defend the so-called liberally

08:03.450 --> 08:11.880
born pilot wave theory or the many, many world interpretations interpretation of quantum physics of

08:12.510 --> 08:13.470
huge Everet.

08:13.710 --> 08:19.820
Yeah, those who know a bit of quantum physics know what I'm talking about.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.450
If you don't understand it again, don't panic.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.930
We will discuss this.

08:26.200 --> 08:35.400
However, even though I will look upon the facts from the perspective of an non-deterministic, just

08:35.400 --> 08:43.470
as every other physicist does from his or her own perspective, based on their subjective preferences

08:43.470 --> 08:44.010
as well.

08:44.820 --> 08:48.410
Whether they want to admit it or not, it's useless.

08:48.630 --> 08:51.000
We all have our subjective approach.

08:52.080 --> 08:59.160
This should not be of concern here, since what we will first and foremost lay out here are just the

08:59.160 --> 09:03.800
facts, facts, the empirical and experimental phenomena.

09:04.680 --> 09:12.410
Therefore, you won't lose anything because as I already said, it is just because you will learn these

09:12.420 --> 09:13.890
basics that then.

09:14.950 --> 09:21.220
You can take your own personal standpoint and embrace the interpretation you like.

09:23.370 --> 09:30.960
So let us briefly now take a look at the main topics that will be covered in this course.

09:32.960 --> 09:38.990
First of all, we will discuss the birth of quantum mechanics with a historical overview from the very

09:38.990 --> 09:41.570
first conceptual foundation.

09:42.800 --> 09:53.090
It begins with the all the controversy regarding whether light is a wave or if it is made of particles.

09:53.450 --> 10:00.320
Is is it a wave or is it made of particles or are these waves made of particles or whatever?

10:00.920 --> 10:08.330
This question seemed to receive a definite answer with Yang's double slit experiment and yet had to

10:08.330 --> 10:12.110
be reviewed later when quantum physics was born.

10:13.730 --> 10:20.000
Historically, the birth of quantum mechanics is identified with the intuition of Max Planck that explains

10:20.000 --> 10:26.570
the so-called black body radiation by postulating that energy exists only in quantized forms.

10:27.470 --> 10:35.510
Well, not every physicist, not every historian of science would agree with this, but that's what

10:35.510 --> 10:37.490
the majority thinks.

10:37.490 --> 10:46.850
And it is quite a bit arbitrary, a fixation point where to place the beginning of the history of something.

10:47.330 --> 10:53.330
Normally it is done with the black body radiation, the discovery and the explanation of the black body

10:53.330 --> 10:55.670
radiation curve by Max Planck.

10:57.830 --> 11:02.900
This will be connected to the description of that unexpected phenomenon.

11:03.840 --> 11:11.220
The photoelectric effect which led Einstein to introduce the notion of the photo that is the photon

11:11.220 --> 11:12.570
as a light particle.

11:14.390 --> 11:22.880
Then something will be said about Borse Atum, the famous principle of uncertainty of Heisenberg and

11:22.880 --> 11:31.580
the even more famous wave particle duality and other notions which will follow us as necessary ingredients

11:31.580 --> 11:40.970
to understand the basis of modern quantum theory, especially some emphasis will be given to the uncertainty

11:42.260 --> 11:43.610
principle of Eisenbach.

11:45.810 --> 11:50.620
The following chapters will address some important technicalities that are nonetheless interesting.

11:51.300 --> 11:57.180
First, the quantum world of spinning particles is a short but intense description of the notion's,

11:57.180 --> 12:04.950
like the spin of particles with a special emphasis on the stand stand Galla experiments what the spin

12:04.950 --> 12:06.180
of a particle is.

12:06.210 --> 12:09.270
Well, that will remain forever.

12:09.270 --> 12:13.080
Probably a mystery because you should not imagine something spinning.

12:13.560 --> 12:24.770
And yet it is the only way, as with which we, our human brain, our human mind can understand things

12:24.930 --> 12:33.180
also in the microscopic world where we will discuss why this is not very good understanding of things

12:34.350 --> 12:34.820
here.

12:34.830 --> 12:41.490
We will focus on the aspects of quantum theory which sparked so many discussions and speculations among

12:41.490 --> 12:45.450
science scientists and philosophers in the last decades.

12:46.860 --> 12:53.430
The typical example of which is a famous thought experiment of Shogunate, Schrodinger said much more

12:53.430 --> 12:56.310
will follow, such as the meaning of quantum superposition.

12:57.090 --> 13:07.470
And yes, of course, we will speak a lot about the famous quantum entanglement and also whether empty

13:07.470 --> 13:09.090
space is really empty.

13:09.090 --> 13:15.240
According to quantum physics at zero point energy, the time and energy, uncertainty, relation and

13:15.240 --> 13:18.830
other quantum effects like tunnel effect and so on.

13:19.890 --> 13:28.650
I hope this video may become soon outdated because maybe at the time you are seeing this video or other

13:28.650 --> 13:32.510
lectures that I did not mention here might have been added.

13:33.630 --> 13:40.200
I will send to all the students, of course, and alert through and an announcement.

13:40.410 --> 13:44.730
So check your settings to get the announcements eventually.

13:46.680 --> 13:50.150
So this is enough as introduction, I would say.

13:50.190 --> 13:54.420
Now it is time to go to the real stuff of this course.
