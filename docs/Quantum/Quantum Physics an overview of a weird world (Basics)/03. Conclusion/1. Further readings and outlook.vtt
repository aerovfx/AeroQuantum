00:01.800 --> 00:07.770
With this first introductory course in quantum physics, I hope that I have been able to furnish you

00:07.770 --> 00:15.300
some basics more than anything else, I hope I have been able to spark in you some interest, more interest

00:15.300 --> 00:22.050
and curiosity about the subject so that you feel encouraged to pursue further research by your own.

00:23.520 --> 00:30.780
If you wish, you can now raise to a higher level, namely that by going to the second you do my course,

00:31.260 --> 00:38.640
which goes beyond the basics and with which you can expand even further your knowledge in the conceptual

00:38.640 --> 00:45.480
foundations of quantum physics, you can find the second part that is the continuation of this course

00:45.490 --> 00:47.700
here on the Udemy My Portal.

00:48.630 --> 00:59.190
It has the same name Quantum Physics, an overview of a weird world part two, or what you can do is

00:59.190 --> 01:01.110
also to look up for my book.

01:01.650 --> 01:11.640
In fact, I have written a book this one here, of course, with the same name and title and which contains

01:11.850 --> 01:16.290
both Udemy courses in paperback in paperback format.

01:16.920 --> 01:27.060
Also in e-book format, you can find it everywhere on Amazon, and it is about 300 pages.

01:28.120 --> 01:35.020
And with you can find the black and white edition and color edition, the color is unfortunately.

01:35.950 --> 01:39.940
Quite expensive, but black and white is more than sufficient.

01:40.510 --> 01:50.920
And you can go and the details that we have already discussed here as also going beyond that, namely

01:50.920 --> 02:00.250
the second course I meant sometimes people ask me for further literature, and I must say that this

02:00.250 --> 02:07.600
is a bit complicated matter for me because the reason why I felt to create this course was precisely

02:07.810 --> 02:16.060
because I think that there are no books that reflect a reasonable balance between the conceptual foundations

02:16.060 --> 02:24.340
of quantum mechanics, its technical aspects, and that tackle the more philosophical questions in one

02:24.340 --> 02:25.630
and the same course.

02:27.010 --> 02:34.150
Either they are heavily technical and mathematical, or they dwell only in the philosophical aspects

02:34.480 --> 02:35.020
or.

02:35.590 --> 02:39.490
Well, let me say it worse, they tell people fairy tales.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.460
So as far as I know, there is no book on the line of this course.

02:46.150 --> 02:53.200
However, having said that, truths also that this is only a starting point and that different perspectives

02:53.200 --> 02:55.270
and different approaches and.

02:56.340 --> 03:05.160
Different stuff might enrich you as well, if you would like to maintain a non-academic approach and

03:05.610 --> 03:12.630
ruminate more on the philosophical historical aspects, you might appreciate the following books that,

03:12.990 --> 03:19.680
at least at the time of this video, are the ones people most seem to appreciate.

03:20.160 --> 03:26.220
I will not go into the details or its contents or make any review of it.

03:27.210 --> 03:30.300
You can find this abundantly online.

03:30.960 --> 03:37.350
I just site quickly their titles and then let you decide by yourself if they fit your interest.

03:38.700 --> 03:44.460
For example, what I found particularly interesting what was what is real?

03:45.000 --> 03:51.030
The Unfinished Quest for the Meaning of Quantum Physics by Adam Baker.

03:52.770 --> 04:01.200
Through two doors at once, the elegant experiment that captures the enigma of our quantum reality by

04:01.230 --> 04:11.330
Arnie Ananta from seven-letter lessons on physics and especially the order of Time by Kyla Lavelle.

04:13.650 --> 04:20.940
Einstein's unfinished revolution, the search for what lies beyond the Quantum by Lee Smolin.

04:22.140 --> 04:29.790
And if you're interested for more a bit more technical but still not to obstruct and still not at the

04:30.450 --> 04:33.210
textbooks, let a level of university.

04:33.720 --> 04:41.820
What I found interesting are the two books of Leonardo Susskind the theoretical minimum what you need

04:41.820 --> 04:42.900
to know to start.

04:43.810 --> 04:46.810
And quantum mechanics, the theoretical minimum.

04:48.990 --> 04:49.440
So.

04:50.530 --> 04:55.510
I encourage you also to send me feedbacks and suggestions.

04:56.770 --> 05:05.170
If you like this course, please leave also a review and with if you wish, also with some text, which

05:05.380 --> 05:11.350
allows me to understand better how I can optimize it.

05:12.910 --> 05:19.030
So thank you very much for having followed me and have a nice time.
