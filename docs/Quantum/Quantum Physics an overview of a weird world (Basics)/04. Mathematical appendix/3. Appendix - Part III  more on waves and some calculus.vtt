00:00.800 --> 00:08.210
So far, we have described the amplitudes and the instantaneous feel strength of the wave, which can

00:08.210 --> 00:15.700
be a positive or negative number if its value is above or below the X axis.

00:16.670 --> 00:21.230
This could be also the value of the electric or magnetic field vector.

00:22.420 --> 00:31.540
Or or the value of any wave in this case, the FT amplitude can't be taken as a measure of the intensity

00:31.540 --> 00:32.660
of a light ray.

00:32.870 --> 00:40.120
However, and we have already seen this in a previous lecture when we discussed the double slit experiment,

00:41.350 --> 00:50.260
we can take just the amplitude and this expression, this mathematical expression of a wave as its intensity,

00:50.650 --> 00:53.880
since a negative intensity is not very meaningful.

00:55.030 --> 01:02.530
Therefore, what is defined in physics as in the intensity of light beam, that kind of stimulus we

01:02.530 --> 01:10.990
can perceive with our eyes must always be positive and in physics corresponds to the square models of

01:10.990 --> 01:12.680
the field, the square.

01:12.700 --> 01:20.620
Most of the models of the wave function is what we call the intensity, or as we will, shall see also

01:20.620 --> 01:25.600
the probability, density, probability of an event in quantum mechanics to take place.

01:27.190 --> 01:34.870
And for the same reason, a squared models of a complex number as we have seen previously, Furnaces

01:35.140 --> 01:38.890
furnishes the squared rate vector length gives us.

01:39.850 --> 01:49.690
Our capital are there vector, the squared model of a complex wavefunction, gives always the squared

01:49.690 --> 01:52.490
amplitude of the wave like here.

01:53.110 --> 02:01.330
So if we have the same wavefunction, complex way function bpci x t.

02:02.580 --> 02:12.870
Which gives us the value of a wave in a point in space X at time T, if we take off this, the complex

02:13.770 --> 02:24.420
modulus squared models, we obtain the model squared of the amplitude of the wave, how big the wave

02:24.420 --> 02:24.780
is.

02:27.510 --> 02:38.010
And it is this general quantity that is defined as the intensity of the wave and it is independent from

02:38.010 --> 02:39.270
any space position.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.400
Time, instant or initial phase.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.680
Finally, just a note.

02:49.080 --> 02:56.940
Uh, we have already seen how waves add together, add or subtract together, and we have the interference

02:56.940 --> 02:57.440
phenomenon.

02:57.810 --> 03:04.980
We have seen this in the double slit experiment and in the lectures which described the.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.460
Tomas Young Dubbers little experiment, so go back to that lecture.

03:10.870 --> 03:19.900
I do not go into the details again, but just to remind you that this mathematical procedure is used

03:19.900 --> 03:29.290
to calculate interference phenomena, what one does is you take two waves, for example, or so many,

03:29.290 --> 03:30.010
many more.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.730
But let's do it with two waves.

03:33.640 --> 03:43.010
You have, say, one side to add them together, obtain another wave, which is, however, can we have

03:43.210 --> 03:53.020
positive as negative values so that this does not represent an intensity, a physically detectable real?

03:54.920 --> 04:05.420
Phenomenon we make, however, the model square of this to added functions and obtain the interference

04:05.420 --> 04:05.820
pattern.

04:06.770 --> 04:16.040
I just wanted to remind you what we did in the lecture previously, and so this might clarify this further.

04:17.730 --> 04:27.450
A final mathematical identity, and that is is a bit tricky, but will turn out to be useful is that

04:27.450 --> 04:34.650
of the intensity function resulting from a generic addition of two wave to complex ways.

04:35.250 --> 04:45.000
So one answer to that is the square models offered some as this one that you can see here, we take

04:45.420 --> 04:55.290
the model square of Siwan plus side two, which means for the definition of how a complex conjugate

04:55.290 --> 05:07.230
is defined and also because of the binomial theorem binomial law that we have to multiply this parenthesis

05:07.230 --> 05:07.590
here.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.840
So one plus BPCI, two times the complex conjugate.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.230
So one start to start.

05:16.890 --> 05:27.030
Then using the distributive distributive law, you get one townsite, one start plus one to start,

05:27.030 --> 05:31.580
plus apply to say one star plus PERTZYE to say two star.

05:32.580 --> 05:40.070
And if you look you see that want say one star is just the definition of the model.

05:40.070 --> 05:48.480
The square of one side to say two star is the definition of the model, the square of cyto.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.860
And then there is a remaining term which is the interference term.

05:54.930 --> 06:04.500
These two first one usually then in physics say one model the square plus SPSSI two Model Square are

06:04.710 --> 06:07.110
the intensities here.

06:07.380 --> 06:12.480
This last term is what is called also the interference term.

06:12.480 --> 06:22.050
And that we will we are we have discussed or if it didn't get there, you will see that determines the

06:22.050 --> 06:29.160
interference fringes in the experiment of the double slit experiment or many slit experiment.

06:30.240 --> 06:43.230
This last term turns out, because if we will, the complex waves as say one equals x1 plus I y one

06:43.350 --> 06:52.830
and two equals x2 plus I imagine an imaginary number y two as we know, because it's just we know these

06:52.830 --> 06:53.820
are complex numbers.

06:53.840 --> 07:01.110
Then you have to write this middle term here, this term in the center.

07:01.850 --> 07:02.440
Uh.

07:03.450 --> 07:11.760
Again, you rewrite it, remember to make the complex conjugate, it means that we insert here the minus

07:11.760 --> 07:20.700
sign and you rewrite this term here and you get you have to make all the calculations.

07:20.700 --> 07:25.200
And what you get is this this result.

07:26.640 --> 07:37.080
It is a little bit cumbersome calculation, but just take a piece of paper and and make all the steps,

07:37.590 --> 07:46.500
read all the steps down, you will get this expression here two times x1 x2 plus two times Y one y two.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.660
And you can check that.

07:48.660 --> 07:57.600
In fact, this is two times the real part of BPCI one stop side two, or if you prefer, two times the

07:57.600 --> 08:02.310
real part of one side to start, just check it.

08:02.760 --> 08:14.130
But what what is what the important thing is, is to remember beyond these algebraic details that this

08:14.130 --> 08:23.870
is the interference term between two interfering ways or also between two interfering quantum states.

08:24.450 --> 08:33.840
One of the basic conceptual pillars of calculus is the concept of the derivative of a real or complex

08:33.840 --> 08:34.360
function.

08:36.030 --> 08:45.360
Broadly speaking, it is that quantity which tells us how sensitive to change a function is in its input,

08:45.360 --> 08:56.370
values and intuitive way to grasp the essence of the of the derivative is to think of our everyday notion

08:56.370 --> 08:57.030
of speed.

08:57.990 --> 09:05.580
We measure the speed of an object as the rate of change of its position in space over time.

09:07.040 --> 09:18.620
The function would be, in this example, a position function as in time parameter Denay as of the speed.

09:20.030 --> 09:31.190
The velocity V V of T in time is its derivative because it says something about the rate of change of

09:31.190 --> 09:32.090
S in T.

09:34.300 --> 09:41.770
Generally speaking, assuming only real numbers for the sake of simplicity here, if we plot the graph

09:41.770 --> 09:56.170
of a function F against its variable X in an X Y Cartesian coordinate system such as Y equals F of X,

09:57.130 --> 10:07.030
then the derivative of the function measures the rate at which the value Y of the function changes with

10:07.030 --> 10:10.150
respect to the change of the variable X.

10:11.510 --> 10:15.980
It is called the derivative of F with respect to X.

10:17.440 --> 10:22.660
Graphically, it represents the slope of the function at each point.

10:24.170 --> 10:31.790
Let us take as an example, the slope of a linear function, the graph is just a straight line, as

10:31.790 --> 10:41.810
in this figure here in the in this case, the slope M is defined as the change in Y over the change

10:41.810 --> 10:50.300
in X and which symbolically due to this graph here means Y two minus one.

10:51.470 --> 10:57.500
Divided X two minus X one, and which usually usually is.

10:59.650 --> 11:05.100
Written in a more compact form as Delta Y over Delta X.

11:07.200 --> 11:17.160
This can be extended to any function if we consider the infinitesimal change of a function in Y along

11:17.160 --> 11:29.910
the Y axis denoted as the Y means a little bit, uh, for an infinitesimal change in X a little bit.

11:31.120 --> 11:44.140
You change, you move around along the x axis, denoted that as the X, then the slope M becomes an

11:44.140 --> 11:53.530
infinitesimal quantity as well in the sense that it expresses the slope of the function that is its

11:53.530 --> 11:54.370
derivative.

11:55.660 --> 12:07.000
Exactly in that point as the gradient, the inclination, the slope of the tangent line in X, and that's

12:07.000 --> 12:16.930
what we can see here in this more general, uh, picture of you are you have a function which is not

12:16.930 --> 12:20.560
necessarily a linear function, just a curve.

12:21.130 --> 12:25.690
And in one point X you determine the slope.

12:25.690 --> 12:36.460
And this turns out to be the tangent line in X of F and which is written in the notation introduced

12:36.460 --> 12:37.600
by Leibnitz.

12:38.210 --> 12:52.960
Uh, with the prime one denotes the derivative operator, the symbol D as F prime of X equals the the

12:53.140 --> 13:07.570
the F of X over there X equals also the over the the X times F X that these are interchangeable symbolics.

13:08.630 --> 13:12.550
And in any case you read this as F prime of X.

13:13.510 --> 13:25.750
For multiple variables, functions such as F, X of X, Y, Z and so on, there exists also the partial

13:25.870 --> 13:30.940
derivative, the symbol of the differential operator.

13:31.930 --> 13:41.830
Becomes Delta instead of the year that Delta here and of F with respect to X or with respect to Y or

13:41.860 --> 13:51.370
with respect to that charter, and it is written, uh, if we chose that differential along only one

13:51.370 --> 14:07.240
direction, let's choose X as ephriam of X of X, Y, Z equals the delta of X over Delta X equals Delta

14:07.270 --> 14:10.360
over Delta six times F of X.

14:10.630 --> 14:13.510
These are again interchangeable symbolics.

14:15.170 --> 14:24.200
Not that one can conceive of the derivative or differential as represented by the action of operators.

14:25.610 --> 14:37.400
We have the operators, the over the X or Delta, over the X respectively, and we conceive that as

14:37.400 --> 14:40.130
operating on the function F.

14:42.410 --> 14:50.700
This operator notion is central and is a central object in quantum mechanics, and we will see this.

14:51.860 --> 14:57.050
Moreover, of course, it is possible to conceive of multiple derivations differentiations.

14:57.710 --> 15:06.290
The second derivative of a function is the derivative of a derivative of it's not only two times the

15:06.290 --> 15:14.980
multiple derivatives and derivative is a derivative of the derivative of the derivative of Syria.

15:14.990 --> 15:24.770
And times in general, one writes for the end of the derivative or differentiation operator.

15:25.870 --> 15:26.260
The.

15:27.160 --> 15:34.060
Power and over the ex power and or the same with the Delta Simbo.

15:37.260 --> 15:45.480
So returning to our previous example, the speed of a body whose movement is described by the function

15:45.480 --> 15:47.610
S of T.

15:49.290 --> 15:52.800
Or enty in space is a derivative.

15:53.740 --> 15:58.990
V of T equals the S of T of ADT.

16:00.230 --> 16:09.620
And by the way, the acceleration A is a second derivative, that is the rate of change of the speed

16:09.630 --> 16:10.850
or the velocity.

16:11.690 --> 16:19.850
Think of it, the acceleration is just the change of speed as the speed is a change in space.

16:20.270 --> 16:26.090
The acceleration is a measure of the change of the velocity of the speed or the speed.

16:26.570 --> 16:32.090
And therefore we ride A of T equals the.

16:33.810 --> 16:38.820
Secondary, simply second derivative of s in time.

16:40.710 --> 16:47.160
Of course, this gives you only a very superficial and intuitive notion of.

16:49.950 --> 17:02.100
Calculus elements of and of what it's all about, calculus textbooks on college textbooks, on calculus

17:02.100 --> 17:05.430
are 500, 2000 pages thick.

17:05.430 --> 17:08.480
So we cannot do justice to this.

17:08.730 --> 17:14.460
However, for our purposes, this glimpse is sufficient.

17:16.430 --> 17:25.700
With this, we have gone through the most difficult and hard part of this short and little mathematical

17:25.700 --> 17:35.540
primer I placed here in the appendix of this course, we have only to take a quick look at the concept

17:35.540 --> 17:36.980
of the integral.

17:40.460 --> 17:47.600
A long and articulated introduction to differential integral calculus would be needed to describe satisfyingly

17:47.630 --> 17:56.810
what in an integral of a given function is in mathematics here, not at all rigorous and quite sloppy

17:56.810 --> 18:04.370
and only intuitive description will be given, generally speaking, and integral in a two dimensional

18:04.370 --> 18:07.970
space is a measure of the area.

18:08.980 --> 18:18.220
A, that a given function F of X and closes the X axis over an interval A P.

18:19.650 --> 18:31.780
Symbolically, it is written as this one here, a integral from A to B of F X, the X with the X as

18:32.100 --> 18:36.240
tells us along which Axis one is integrating.

18:38.070 --> 18:48.090
And graphic graphically, it represents the shaded area in this figure, similar definition holds also

18:48.090 --> 18:54.630
for the integration in a three dimensional space or eventually even also in an N dimensional space with

18:54.990 --> 18:58.380
three, four, five, six, seven and more dimensions.

18:59.790 --> 19:03.530
This is, however, only a very general understanding of the notion of an integral.

19:04.140 --> 19:09.830
The coordinate axis must not necessarily represent space coordinates.

19:11.010 --> 19:19.290
For example, the x axis could represent the flow of time in the Y axis, a power consumption of an

19:19.290 --> 19:20.940
electric device, for example.

19:22.280 --> 19:29.390
When Tiger offered over a time interval would furnish the total energy consumption, then in this specific

19:29.390 --> 19:38.810
example, another practical example which might be useful to introduce us intuitively to the application

19:39.020 --> 19:45.260
to the application of integrals in quantum mechanics could be the calculation of the mass of the mass

19:45.530 --> 19:53.030
distribution in a body of volume V and density function roll over X, Y and Z.

19:54.400 --> 20:03.100
The three dimensional density function tells us how dense the body is at a specific location at a point

20:03.100 --> 20:14.590
in X, Y, Z, in some density units say grams over cubic centimeters or kilograms or cubic meters and

20:14.590 --> 20:15.010
so on.

20:16.610 --> 20:25.370
Then the overall mass of the body is given by the three dimensional integral over all the volume V of

20:25.370 --> 20:28.800
the density function, as you can see here.

20:28.880 --> 20:38.720
So you have a triple intriguer integral over the X, the Y that set because we are in a three dimensional

20:38.720 --> 20:39.190
space.

20:39.530 --> 20:46.910
And of course, also the density function must be something that describes the density in a point inside

20:46.910 --> 20:49.810
a body with the three coordinate.

20:51.290 --> 20:58.250
What will turn out to be of particular interest for our purposes is the integration of the wave function.

20:58.520 --> 21:06.860
More precisely, a squared modulus model squared modulus of PSI X and which is a probability, a probability

21:06.860 --> 21:16.040
density in the area gives us the probability that a quantum phenomenon takes place.

21:18.380 --> 21:28.550
For instance, you want to know what the probability is to find a particle in the interval A, B from

21:28.550 --> 21:34.580
A to B., you have to take the wave function of this particle size.

21:34.970 --> 21:40.550
X makes a model square and integrate it over this interval.

21:40.940 --> 21:47.930
And then you get that probability to find that the particle inside that interval.

21:49.280 --> 21:58.820
More on that in the lectures about the wave function that the liberally wavefunction Dirac Formalism,

21:59.420 --> 22:01.310
Bonnaroo and so on.
