00:00.060 --> 00:06.900
Here, a very important chapter of our little and fast overview of the mathematical.

00:07.930 --> 00:09.370
Basics that we need.

00:10.610 --> 00:19.370
In this cause and this are the trigonometric functions and waves, so let us briefly take a look to

00:19.370 --> 00:24.400
the formalism that describes waves and is used extensively in quantum mechanics.

00:26.090 --> 00:32.880
If you are already acquainted with trigonometry and complex numbers, you can, of course, skip all

00:32.900 --> 00:35.900
this section as all of this appendix.

00:36.080 --> 00:43.940
However, I think it is important to agree, at least on some basic notions and conventions on the symbolism

00:43.970 --> 00:54.590
that will be used throughout this course here will lay the foundations for the most basic and elementary

00:54.590 --> 01:02.470
descriptions of the wave and intemperance phenomena which are ubiquitous in quantum physics.

01:02.480 --> 01:11.660
And this will also open for us the way on the concept to the concept of the wavefunction and notion

01:11.660 --> 01:16.190
of paramount importance in all quantum physics discussions.

01:17.870 --> 01:25.820
You may recall from your school math classes, some to grant trigonometry and how the cosine and sine

01:25.820 --> 01:33.950
functions resemble, well, a periodic oscillation that is, so to speak, a wavy movement.

01:36.610 --> 01:45.700
Be it an electromagnetic wave, a sound wave, a water wave or any wave motions or perturbations, they

01:45.700 --> 01:49.420
can easily be described by sine cosine functions.

01:50.260 --> 01:54.160
There are, however, notable exceptions, for example.

01:55.080 --> 02:04.620
Waves in shallow water and so on, which are not cosine functions, but however and for most applications,

02:04.980 --> 02:13.500
the so-called cosine function that is to trigonometric functions serve well, that to the default for

02:13.500 --> 02:21.780
our description of the real world, the red curve shows the sine function where the blue one is the

02:21.780 --> 02:22.720
cosine function.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.010
Both have the same domain.

02:26.910 --> 02:31.810
That is, they are both traced along the X axis.

02:32.910 --> 02:40.800
This x axis could represent a spatial, temporal or angular or any other kind of physical magnitude.

02:42.100 --> 02:51.420
For example, just think of time passing by along the X axis where you put seconds or minutes or hours

02:53.070 --> 02:53.900
in this figure.

02:53.910 --> 03:03.930
Instead, the x axis represents the angular radiance value radians take take the value from zero to

03:03.930 --> 03:13.830
two pi instead of the angles in degrees from zero to 360 degrees and has been here subdivided in steps

03:13.830 --> 03:15.450
of PI force.

03:17.290 --> 03:27.970
The head of the wave at the specific value for X SCIEX is plotted on the vertical axis and is simply

03:27.970 --> 03:31.450
called the magnitude magnitude of a wave.

03:33.300 --> 03:40.530
The choice of the Greek letter BPCI is not a coincidence, it is the famous and most used letter in

03:40.530 --> 03:42.690
all textbooks on quantum mechanics.

03:44.600 --> 03:51.520
The maximum and minimum hate for sine and cosine functions are plus and minus one, respectively.

03:53.650 --> 04:01.420
Now, what distinguishes the two waves or the two functions is that they are shifted relative to each

04:01.420 --> 04:05.560
other along the horizontal x axis, as you can see.

04:06.440 --> 04:13.830
Otherwise, they are perfectly the same object, how much a wave is shifted relative to the other?

04:14.660 --> 04:18.120
Is that what determines their relative phase?

04:18.570 --> 04:20.180
That's a notion of phase.

04:20.190 --> 04:26.480
That's how two waves are displaced or shifted relative to each other.

04:27.530 --> 04:36.600
The sine function, if nothing else, then the cosine function shifted by a phase difference of minus

04:36.710 --> 04:39.550
P half or vice versa.

04:39.980 --> 04:44.270
The cosine is sine shifted by plus behav.

04:46.630 --> 04:54.490
Notice that the concept of face is a relative notion, not an absolute one, the face of a wave must

04:54.490 --> 04:59.490
be determined relative to another wave or against a fixed reference.

05:00.970 --> 05:06.270
For example, this reference can be another wave or as it is done, usually relative to an origin.

05:06.610 --> 05:11.690
The intersection between between the two axis at X equals zero.

05:13.570 --> 05:20.620
Moreover, an important aspect that differs the two functions and will turn out to be useful throughout

05:21.010 --> 05:25.270
this course is that the cosine is a symmetric function.

05:25.960 --> 05:35.200
That is, it is symmetric with respect to the reflection along the Y axis or its values are equal on

05:35.200 --> 05:42.970
the right and left hand side to the to the origin, whereas the sine function is a. symmetric.

05:44.160 --> 05:48.840
Which means that it has a point symmetry with respect to the origin.

05:49.770 --> 05:57.990
Or its values are opposite on the right and left hand side with respect to the origin.

06:00.270 --> 06:08.580
And this figure, we can see a wave that is described by cosine function with the x axis no longer an

06:08.580 --> 06:12.540
angle in radians, but having the dimension of a spatial quantity.

06:13.490 --> 06:22.130
The x axis in meters is now meters, centimeters, etc., and with a phase shift relative to the spatial

06:22.130 --> 06:27.470
origin that is with the same phase angle, V added.

06:30.320 --> 06:39.200
This space dependent function traces a graph of a wave along the space of the x axis and oscillating

06:39.200 --> 06:42.890
a certain number of times per space unit.

06:44.400 --> 06:51.360
This letter, this letter aspect is accounted by the so-called wave number or wave vector, which is

06:51.360 --> 06:58.030
given by the letter K equal to PI over Lambda.

06:59.460 --> 07:00.870
Therefore, the quantity.

07:01.770 --> 07:09.570
K times X is proportional, proportional to a number that tells us how many times a wave of wave length

07:09.660 --> 07:14.340
wave length lambda can be arranged into a space interval X.

07:15.430 --> 07:25.300
Times two by The Factor two, PI service serves a purpose to obtain an expression given in radians.

07:27.180 --> 07:35.370
Then the graph of a wave moving along an x axis in space was initial phase five.

07:36.280 --> 07:52.700
And with no Kay is given by this little expression, CI of X equals zero times cosine function of K,

07:52.750 --> 08:01.740
X plus five where size zero represents the maximum value of the oscillator oscillatory movement.

08:02.230 --> 08:10.090
It is the the amplitude that we expressed previously.

08:10.480 --> 08:16.260
We I spoke about previously, it is the amplitude of the wave, no longer unity.

08:16.570 --> 08:24.310
As for the side and cosine function, but any possible value notice that a positive value for the Phase

08:24.310 --> 08:33.280
V shift the cosine function backwards from the right to the left, whereas a negative value from the

08:33.280 --> 08:34.650
left to the right.

08:35.320 --> 08:35.450
Hmm.

08:36.020 --> 08:42.160
So that's the plus or minus sine determines in which direction the.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.450
This mathematical wave moves.

08:48.530 --> 08:52.650
However, real waves are not just frozen grass.

08:52.970 --> 09:00.700
They move with time passing by to account for the temporal evolution of a travelling wave.

09:01.070 --> 09:09.020
Another non-negative face term, which changes with time, is added to the description of a wave making

09:09.020 --> 09:12.310
the graph move towards the right direction.

09:14.470 --> 09:24.640
Just like here, you see that the blue dot oscillating up and down and the peaks moving from the left

09:24.640 --> 09:27.160
to the right with time passing by.

09:30.530 --> 09:38.780
To every periodically oscillating phenomenon, we associate a frequency, the number of oscillations

09:39.530 --> 09:40.550
time unit.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.790
The international unit standard for the frequency is the Hertz.

09:48.910 --> 09:57.860
That is written in shorthand as a Unit H said, which is the number of oscillations per second.

09:58.650 --> 10:08.730
And is labeled with a Greek letter, no, for example, no equal 50 hertz means 50 oscillations per

10:08.730 --> 10:09.300
second.

10:11.730 --> 10:22.710
One then defines as Omega, this Greek letter here, equal to PI, no, as as the angular frequency,

10:23.280 --> 10:28.860
the frequency times two pi with which the wave oscillates.

10:30.660 --> 10:38.730
The quantity of Omega times t is proportional to a number that tells us how many times a wave of frequency,

10:38.730 --> 10:46.230
new oscillates and terror in the time interval, 30 times to PI, as usual.

10:47.820 --> 10:50.850
One might consider it also a temporary phase shift.

10:52.370 --> 10:55.790
As the wave no accounts for the spatial coordinates.

10:56.800 --> 11:07.630
OK, times X, the angular frequency accounts for the temporal displacement olmeda times to a real wave

11:08.080 --> 11:20.680
of amplitude zero wave number K and initial phase V can therefore be represented by a two valued function

11:21.850 --> 11:29.320
CI of X T equal size, zero times cosine.

11:30.160 --> 11:35.470
OK, X minus Omega, T plus five.

11:36.800 --> 11:43.100
And which depends both from a space coronate X at a time Paramatta T.

11:45.410 --> 11:48.200
The negative sign in front of the angular frequency.

11:49.120 --> 11:53.590
Assures that the wave moves from the left to the right.

11:54.830 --> 11:55.140
Hmm.

11:57.270 --> 12:05.280
With this general expression for a wave, one can describe any physical wave movement phenomenon in

12:05.280 --> 12:05.790
physics.

12:07.230 --> 12:13.860
This equation is the most common mathematical description of oscillatory phenomena.

12:17.490 --> 12:26.520
Let us now go over to another very important chapter of the mathematical description of quantum mechanics,

12:27.330 --> 12:28.140
which is the.

12:29.150 --> 12:36.950
That of complex numbers, complex numbers are and complex, complex functions are used everywhere in

12:36.950 --> 12:37.850
quantum mechanics.

12:39.850 --> 12:41.080
Why complex numbers?

12:41.980 --> 12:48.400
Well, for the simple reason that they are nowadays used everywhere in science where waves come into

12:48.400 --> 12:48.730
play.

12:50.090 --> 12:56.310
Moreover, as we shall see, the concept of the wavefunction is a complex, valued function.

12:57.530 --> 13:02.810
So let us see first where the where the idea of complex numbers comes from.

13:04.370 --> 13:11.420
Historically, it was because mathematicians tried to solve equations where the square root of a negative

13:11.420 --> 13:13.520
number could furnish a solution.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.270
For example, this one.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.380
Alpha squared plus one equals zero.

13:21.870 --> 13:31.830
This can be solved only if we admit the existence of a number called the the imaginary number I and

13:31.830 --> 13:34.920
which is the square root of minus one.

13:36.340 --> 13:41.380
Here, alpha equals I equals square root of minus one.

13:42.890 --> 13:48.980
Inserted and you see, obviously, that it is a solution, but also other equations, for example,

13:48.980 --> 13:58.400
the cubic cubic polynomial equation like this one eight times cubic ULFA plus B.

13:59.380 --> 14:08.770
Alpha squared, plus see Alpha plus the equals zero with A, B, C, the some real coefficients, this

14:08.770 --> 14:17.140
equation requests a solution that is given by a more general, complex number which usually is labeled

14:17.470 --> 14:26.080
with the number that in general, any complex number that is the sum of a conventional real part X and

14:26.080 --> 14:37.180
written as real of Z plus another imaginary part erm offset and which is the imaginary number times

14:37.480 --> 14:45.250
another real value y that is that is equal X plus ie times Y.

14:46.090 --> 14:49.010
Where X and Y are just real numbers.

14:49.270 --> 14:58.150
But why is multiplied by the imaginary number, which is the square root of minus one?

14:59.700 --> 15:07.890
This means that we can represent any complex number also graphically on a Cartesian x y plane.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.520
That is the so-called complex plane.

15:14.400 --> 15:22.050
In this complex plane, the real part of any complex numbers given on the horizontal x axis, while

15:22.330 --> 15:25.680
the imaginary part on the Y axis.

15:27.910 --> 15:34.600
Notice that instead of using the Cartesian x y coordinate axis, it is also possible to represent the

15:34.600 --> 15:45.250
same complex number with Ray Vector R capital letters R and its corresponding angle teta teta, the

15:45.250 --> 15:51.100
Greek letter teta as shown by the upper red vector.

15:51.100 --> 16:00.070
And this figure here, which means that we can represent any complex number resorting to trigonometric

16:00.070 --> 16:03.190
functions, the sign and cosine functions.

16:04.280 --> 16:11.420
So we recovered something that we use later, because any complex numbers, real parts value along the

16:11.420 --> 16:17.920
X axis can be represented by the X equal real part of that, which is nothing else.

16:17.930 --> 16:22.370
There are times cosine of theta.

16:23.090 --> 16:31.970
While it's in the imaginary part, value along the Y axis is y equal.

16:32.910 --> 16:39.000
Imaginary part of that equal ah times sent a sign of data.

16:41.480 --> 16:46.490
Putting this together and a complex number can be represented, as said.

16:47.660 --> 16:54.650
Equal X plus Y equals the Rivette, there are times.

16:55.610 --> 16:57.380
The square back in square brackets.

16:58.580 --> 17:01.970
Cosine of Theta plus I sign Detta.

17:04.390 --> 17:11.980
It is customary among physicists and mathematicians to write this in an equivalent, but more compact

17:11.980 --> 17:21.880
form by using the exponential function that is the so-called oilor number and which has a precise value

17:22.520 --> 17:26.010
equal to point seven, one, eight and so on.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.810
It is an irrational number.

17:28.120 --> 17:33.400
It has an infinite number of delegates and the expression.

17:34.800 --> 17:41.250
E to the power I take to represent the unitary circle in the complex plane.

17:42.300 --> 17:54.330
That is the circle of radius are equal one and which crosses the x axis at plus minus one and the Y

17:54.330 --> 18:05.520
axis at the imaginary numbers plus minus I, that is when one sets are equal one and theta equal plus

18:05.520 --> 18:07.040
minus by half.

18:08.430 --> 18:16.410
Then one obtains the so-called oilor formula discovered by the famous Swiss mathematician Leonid Euler

18:16.800 --> 18:25.620
in the 16th century and which reads E to the power I theta equal.

18:26.790 --> 18:30.660
Because cosine of Theta plus I sign Detta.

18:32.920 --> 18:37.810
The important numbers to keep in mind are especially e to the power.

18:38.950 --> 18:50.560
Zero equals one E to the power plus minus I pay half equals plus minus I e to the power plus minus I

18:50.560 --> 18:52.900
p equals minus one.

18:54.700 --> 19:03.100
Therefore, any complex number can be represented also by set equal R times E to the power Eita and

19:03.100 --> 19:03.460
from.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.070
That follows.

19:07.730 --> 19:20.450
X equal real part of our times, E to the power eita equal R Times commentator Y equal imaginary part

19:21.510 --> 19:28.730
all of our times e to the power I teta equal air are sign detta.

19:31.370 --> 19:38.000
Another concept you will frequently find in news in the complex, no formalism is a complex conjugate.

19:39.770 --> 19:43.280
The complex conjugate is that of that.

19:44.320 --> 19:53.230
Equal X plus I y is nothing else than this number here reflected across the X axis.

19:54.470 --> 20:04.280
The Red River below the x axis, it is obtained only by changing the sign on the imaginary part on the

20:04.520 --> 20:16.580
angle theta, as said Star Star stands for the complex conjugate said star equals X minus eye times

20:16.580 --> 20:24.620
Y, and which is equal are the vector times oil and number to the power minus I.

20:25.650 --> 20:26.700
TimeStep.

20:28.920 --> 20:35.010
The complex conjugate that is usually written with a star or bar symbol of a satellite that starts at

20:35.010 --> 20:38.370
Spart will use the star here.

20:40.020 --> 20:48.570
This is usually very useful to obtain the the absolute value of any complex number.

20:48.620 --> 20:54.480
Therefore, we have to distinguish between the absolute values of real numbers that we have seen.

20:54.810 --> 21:01.110
You take just a square root of the or the number square instead.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.300
It's a little bit more tricky.

21:05.910 --> 21:16.830
An easy and quick way to remember and to imagine the absolute value of a complex number is just think

21:17.130 --> 21:25.530
at the rate vector are capital letter are, which is nothing less than the length of this vector.

21:25.560 --> 21:28.780
This is the absolute value in the complex plane.

21:29.940 --> 21:41.130
If we define as the squared modulus of a complex number as model of squared of Z equals, said Times,

21:41.130 --> 21:41.940
said Star.

21:43.080 --> 21:51.660
And that is the complex number of times its own complex conjugate, and if you want to buy yourself

21:51.660 --> 21:59.500
a quick calculation, you will realize that the model A squared offset equals said times.

21:59.540 --> 22:12.570
That star equals are times e to the power I teta times are times e power minus I teta to equal.

22:13.970 --> 22:27.410
X plus I Y times X minus I Y, and this gives X squared plus plus Y squared and which is R-squared,

22:28.010 --> 22:37.190
Kazantsev squared plus sine squared as shown here, and which finally gives the square of the array

22:37.190 --> 22:37.730
vector.

22:39.540 --> 22:44.460
And the last step, because of the turmoil in the square brackets being Alwis unit.

22:46.820 --> 22:53.870
This means also that the rave act or are is the models of the complex number are equal said.

22:55.080 --> 23:05.010
Absolute value, some of you may have noticed that this is the good old Pythagorean theorem, X and

23:05.010 --> 23:10.950
Y are the legs and R is the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

23:12.910 --> 23:18.960
We shall see why the concept of the square models of a complex number is so important in quantum mechanics,

23:19.900 --> 23:27.310
it turns out it will turn out to be the measure for the probability that an event in the quantum world

23:27.520 --> 23:28.270
occurs.

23:30.450 --> 23:35.080
Complex numbers are well suited to represent functions of waves.

23:35.340 --> 23:44.430
This is not surprising when we think how the complex Reflektor of length our are spending with some

23:44.820 --> 23:46.140
angular speed.

23:46.320 --> 23:54.150
The complex circle can represent an oscillatory movement if we if we project.

23:55.420 --> 24:04.660
Are on the x axis, just like we did on the y axis with a blue dot of the previous figure oscillating

24:04.660 --> 24:05.500
up and down.

24:07.370 --> 24:15.260
From this equation, which represents just the projection of the array or are on the x axis.

24:17.860 --> 24:23.920
And recalling how the travelling wavefunction was constructed.

24:25.040 --> 24:35.390
We show it here again and we will place the Ray Rector are with the amplitude of the waves side zero.

24:36.580 --> 24:45.520
This one, while it's oilor angle, theta, is replaced by the spatial and temporal evolution and the

24:45.610 --> 24:48.170
and the initial phase of the wave function.

24:48.610 --> 24:53.920
This part here and insert it in the.

24:54.960 --> 25:05.430
Formula in this formula, then the real part of the complex ray vector gives this as a result where

25:05.430 --> 25:11.310
we have expressed the mathematical formulation of the traveling wave we have seen before.

25:13.090 --> 25:15.160
With the oil afunction.

25:16.930 --> 25:25.090
For compactness, however, physicists and mathematicians used to describe waves or any oscillatory

25:25.090 --> 25:33.100
and periodic phenomenon that can be described by sign of cosine function as complex numbers without

25:33.100 --> 25:44.840
taking the real part simply as this one with a pure expression or where the oil function comes in.

25:46.990 --> 25:54.430
This makes calculations easier, and once a result is obtained, one takes the real path to get an expression

25:54.430 --> 25:55.420
in real numbers.

25:57.220 --> 26:04.180
The point in using complex numbers to describe waves, therefore, is that they can retain a phase in

26:04.180 --> 26:12.640
space and time with some formal advantages over the real trigger on a trigonometric functions.
