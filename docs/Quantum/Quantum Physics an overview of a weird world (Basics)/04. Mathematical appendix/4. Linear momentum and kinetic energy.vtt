The distinction between linear momentum and kinetic energy is sometimes a source of confusion for those

00:07.840 --> 00:15.070
who never learned the basic concepts of classical mechanics, the linear momentum or, in short, just

00:15.070 --> 00:15.800
momentum.

00:16.330 --> 00:23.580
If one does not confuse it with the angular momentum which we described in the lecture on the spins

00:23.590 --> 00:31.920
and then the intrinsic angular momentum of particles and that we will not describe further here, um,

00:32.290 --> 00:40.090
the momentum is a physical property that, loosely speaking, tells us something about the amount of

00:40.090 --> 00:42.810
motion of a particle or a body.

00:44.050 --> 00:51.670
This is not the velocity because two particles with the same speed, but different masses will nevertheless

00:51.670 --> 00:53.710
carry different amounts of momentum.

00:54.700 --> 01:00.990
It makes a difference if a fever strikes you with 100 kilometers per hour or a truck.

01:01.660 --> 01:10.900
So therefore, in classical physics, the momentum P is simply defined as a product of a mass M times

01:10.930 --> 01:12.250
the velocity V.

01:12.970 --> 01:17.290
S P equals M times V, which is a scholar product.

01:18.140 --> 01:27.860
In fact, the bold here, the bold letters fonts here indicate a vector quantity, a velocity, and

01:27.860 --> 01:34.830
consequently the momentum are both described by a direction and an absolute model's value.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.550
What in physics is called speed is the absolute value of the velocity.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.030
That is something independent from the direction.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.010
But the velocity has a direction.

01:46.010 --> 01:53.960
You know that an object can move in a direction with a particular speed.

01:54.830 --> 01:58.340
So it moves in a direction with some velocity.

01:59.510 --> 02:09.110
But the absolute value is the so-called speed, if you are acquainted with scholars and vectors, please

02:09.110 --> 02:16.550
also see the corresponding section of the lecture in the appendix.

02:18.140 --> 02:28.310
Momentum is useful to calculate elastic or inelastic collisions processes between bodies of different

02:28.310 --> 02:30.140
masses and different speeds.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.790
Momentum is sometimes confused with the notion of impulse, which is a difference of momentum a body

02:37.790 --> 02:39.800
acquires after a collision.

02:40.400 --> 02:47.240
So here we have a situation before and after the collision where you can see that how?

02:47.450 --> 02:48.950
With what velocity?

02:50.280 --> 02:59.430
A body moves before it hits another body and what the two bodies, what kind of velocities they have

02:59.430 --> 03:00.720
after this collision?

03:02.690 --> 03:08.510
All this has to be distinguished carefully from the concept of kinetic energy.

03:09.660 --> 03:16.590
First of all, what is in what what is energy in physics, in energy and physics is the amount of work

03:16.590 --> 03:24.600
that the system, a particle or body, can perform on another system in physics by work, which means

03:24.600 --> 03:28.830
the capacity of a force to produce a displacement.

03:30.190 --> 03:38.620
If you carry a heavy mass up to the top of the hill of a hill, you perform more work then by taking

03:38.620 --> 03:42.220
up to the same height of the hill, if either.

03:43.580 --> 03:50.160
More intuitively, work indicates the capacity to cause modification, transformation, disruption,

03:51.470 --> 03:57.050
the heavy body you have lifted up to the top of the hill has therefore a potential energy.

03:57.770 --> 04:04.670
It is potential because if you let it roll down the hill, it will acquire a velocity and therefore

04:04.910 --> 04:07.670
acquire what is called a kinetic energy.

04:08.890 --> 04:17.770
This kinetic energy is defined as half the product of the mass M times the velocity V squared.

04:18.340 --> 04:20.210
As you can see in this formula here.

04:21.820 --> 04:29.050
Another example that makes clear the difference between potential and kinetic energy is the energy stored

04:29.050 --> 04:31.410
in a stretched in a stretched spring.

04:32.290 --> 04:40.030
Once released, it will swing around to the equilibrium point, transforming periodically the potential

04:40.030 --> 04:41.980
energy into kinetic energy.

04:43.150 --> 04:50.230
Whereas the main difference between the momentum and the kinetic energy is that the former grows linearly

04:50.230 --> 04:51.130
with velocity.

04:52.270 --> 05:00.010
That is, you have this formula here, whereas the latter as the square of the velocity.

05:00.490 --> 05:06.580
So this little V and V Square make the big difference.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.650
Furthermore, since V squared is a scholar quantity, the product of two vectors is a scholar.

05:13.810 --> 05:19.840
And you can see the appendix on the scholar and the Vector and Knowshon.

05:22.120 --> 05:27.680
Since V squared is a scholar quantity, also, the energy must be a scholar, just a number.

05:28.420 --> 05:36.760
Contrary to the momentum, momentum being a vector like velocity, energy is therefore always something

05:36.760 --> 05:38.560
that does not depend from a direction.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.420
It is just a number and it is usually expressed in jowls.

05:43.030 --> 05:52.660
This is a measure of energy, both energy and as momentum must be conserved as well known, nothing

05:52.660 --> 05:54.200
can be created or destroyed.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.860
Really, there can only be transformed.

05:58.150 --> 06:04.720
In fact, energy can exist in different forms besides potential or kinetic energy, such as the electrical,

06:04.720 --> 06:11.200
energy, chemical and energy, thermal energy, nuclear energy and so on and so forth.

06:12.670 --> 06:18.790
Much more should be said for a comprehensive and rigorous description of these two fundamental quantities

06:18.790 --> 06:19.360
of physics.

06:19.900 --> 06:23.080
But for now, this is sufficient for our purposes.

06:23.590 --> 06:27.490
The important point is that you don't confuse one with the other.
