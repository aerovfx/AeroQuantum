00:00.820 --> 00:08.620
The very basics you will need always are those little algebra skills we all have been taught in schools

00:09.250 --> 00:16.180
such as being able to deal with fractions, powers and square roots in case you are no longer familiar

00:16.180 --> 00:16.720
with it.

00:16.870 --> 00:24.160
And we need to recapitulate only a few things here that we need in our lectures to understand little

00:24.160 --> 00:26.680
formulas that involve product terms.

00:27.270 --> 00:31.960
For instance, like, for instance, that of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

00:32.380 --> 00:40.030
One should be familiar with the use of algebraic fractions, for example, that from the moment the

00:40.030 --> 00:55.330
product X times Y equals Z follows Y equal set over X or X equals set or Y, that is just a little.

00:56.270 --> 01:04.010
Very basic and elementary skills that you need here with fractions, we don't need much more.

01:05.890 --> 01:16.000
Then about exponentiation, an exponent is a mathematical shorthand that tells us how many times a number

01:16.000 --> 01:26.380
is multiplied against itself in general, given a number be multiplied itself and times one right between

01:26.560 --> 01:28.090
XP, etc., etc..

01:28.090 --> 01:30.190
So on times B equal.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.230
B, power and.

01:34.040 --> 01:37.400
With be called the base and n the exponent.

01:40.070 --> 01:49.130
Not that the base must not necessarily be an integral such as two to the power three equal eight, but

01:49.130 --> 01:50.630
can be any real number.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.750
Typical examples are the formulas for the area.

01:56.010 --> 02:07.590
Capital letter, a letter a of a square and the value volume V of a cube, both with inside a given

02:07.590 --> 02:10.650
as a capital letter A a equal.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.740
A squared and V. equal, a cube.

02:17.040 --> 02:22.110
Don't forget that the square of a negative number always gives a positive one.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.610
That is, for instance, minus two squared equals four, minus three square equals nine, minus four

02:31.610 --> 02:33.680
square equals 16 and so on.

02:36.440 --> 02:44.330
This leads us then also to the square root operation, the square root of a number X is the number Y,

02:44.870 --> 02:47.870
such that Y squared equals X.

02:48.850 --> 03:01.320
It is simple like that, so the square root of X is Y and one right square root of X equals Y.

03:02.940 --> 03:11.430
Like you, example's square root of or equal plus minus two, don't forget the minus square root of

03:11.430 --> 03:15.180
nine plus minus three, square root of sixteen plus minus four.

03:16.240 --> 03:22.320
And there can be also square root of the square also, which give irrational numbers.

03:22.320 --> 03:28.800
That is numbers with an infinite number of digits, like the square root of two equals plus minus one

03:28.800 --> 03:33.320
point four one four two one three five six two, etc..

03:33.600 --> 03:43.170
That's an important concept is that of the absolute value or modulus of X.

03:44.350 --> 03:53.080
Where X is real, number first, we will also deal with complex number later, uh, which is the positive

03:53.080 --> 03:56.100
value of a number regardless of its sign.

03:57.300 --> 04:01.380
For example, minus three in models equals three.

04:02.600 --> 04:12.920
Absolute value of minus 27 equals 27, absolute value of five, remains five, etc., notice that the

04:12.920 --> 04:14.450
modulus of a real number.

04:15.530 --> 04:20.240
Is the square root of its square, that is this one here.

04:21.270 --> 04:25.260
The absolute value of X equals square root of X Square.

04:26.020 --> 04:33.930
That's the way of writing also algebraically the modulus of a real number.

04:35.150 --> 04:40.550
Also to keep in mind are the elementary laws of algebra.

04:42.660 --> 04:51.480
For example, the commutative law states that the order of the terms in a binary operation does not

04:51.480 --> 04:52.870
change the result.

04:53.310 --> 05:03.780
That means if you have two numbers, A and B and you add them up, A plus B is exactly the same thing

05:03.780 --> 05:11.820
as adding up B plus plus one plus eight, for example, three plus two equals two plus three.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.690
It it is equal five.

05:14.160 --> 05:23.970
It seems obvious and elementary, but we will see how in quantum physics commutative property is generally

05:23.970 --> 05:24.960
no longer true.

05:25.410 --> 05:28.710
Then there is the associative law.

05:29.280 --> 05:29.580
Hmm.

05:30.960 --> 05:39.600
Which holds when rearranging the parentheses in expression's containing the same operator does not change

05:39.810 --> 05:41.970
the result that is.

05:42.810 --> 05:51.030
And that if you put in parentheses A plus B and C, this is equal A plus parentheses B plus C.

05:52.610 --> 06:00.080
The same thing also for the multiplication operator in parentheses, A times B.

06:01.390 --> 06:12.310
Then timezone is equal A times A, parenthesis B, times C, or you can also give it a tone and say

06:12.970 --> 06:13.870
eight times B.

06:15.340 --> 06:18.970
Timezone is equal A.

06:20.610 --> 06:21.240
Times.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.220
Betsie.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.800
So you can emphasize this.

06:28.490 --> 06:38.030
Then the distributive law instead holds when the when two operators are involved and you have eight

06:38.030 --> 06:38.660
times.

06:40.050 --> 06:40.830
B plus C.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.610
Is equal intensity.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.510
Plus, H.M.S..

06:48.940 --> 06:55.680
So you just want to placate A with B and then again, A, B, C.

06:57.480 --> 07:07.410
One will frequently find longer variants of this, and that's only the basic law, but you will find

07:07.410 --> 07:18.240
variants such as this one eight times or a set of numbers or parameters or variables in a parenthesis

07:19.740 --> 07:20.490
eight times.

07:20.490 --> 07:29.700
The parentheses B plus, C plus, plus, etc. is equal just the multiplication of the first number or

07:30.210 --> 07:32.640
variable in the first term times.

07:32.670 --> 07:35.040
Each time the.

07:38.810 --> 07:47.870
The numbers contained in the parentheses, this is a tenth B plus eight, eight times C plus eight times

07:47.870 --> 07:57.400
the plus eight times and so on, or generalising with indexed terms A we can use.

07:57.410 --> 08:04.100
And this is used very frequently in physics, that instead, instead of using the letters of the alphabet,

08:04.100 --> 08:06.830
you index them with numbers or variables.

08:06.830 --> 08:17.300
Or for example, think also of the Cartesian coordinates and you have in parentheses X1 plus X2 plus

08:17.300 --> 08:22.160
X3 and so on, times y one, y two and so on.

08:22.430 --> 08:35.060
And then you have to multiply out all of these and you get X one, y one plus x1 y two plus x1 y three

08:35.060 --> 08:35.780
and so on.

08:36.050 --> 08:45.950
And you reach then you go over to the second index x2 y one plus x2 plus x2 y two and so on.

08:50.700 --> 08:58.080
And please notice also that the multiplication, that symbol is frequently omitted when it is obvious,

08:58.080 --> 08:59.970
obvious where it operates.

09:01.880 --> 09:10.130
From that follows immediately that the basic examples that lead to the binomial theorem, we did not

09:10.130 --> 09:15.560
discuss much here and that, for example, if you square.

09:16.530 --> 09:30.330
The sum of two numbers, X plus Y squared gives X squared plus two times X, Y plus Y squared.

09:31.250 --> 09:37.940
If you don't see that, simply take a pencil and a piece of paper and apply the steps given above.

09:39.850 --> 09:51.070
Then one also realizes, for example, that X plus Y in parentheses times X minus Y is just X square

09:51.940 --> 10:00.070
X squared, minus Y squared and should be able to calculate then with that, somewhat more complicated

10:00.160 --> 10:02.950
expressions like this one here.

10:03.120 --> 10:07.630
And I leave this to you as an exercise.

10:13.180 --> 10:21.740
And what about the good old theorem of Pythagoras, the Pythagorean theorem?

10:22.540 --> 10:31.300
Everyone in school learns that it is about the relation of the length of the sides of a right triangle,

10:32.170 --> 10:41.350
namely the square of the hypotenuse, as I see here, opposite the right angle, which is given by the

10:41.350 --> 10:45.670
sum of the square of the other two sides.

10:47.100 --> 10:55.740
The Pythagorean equation states that A squared plus B square is equals C Square.

10:57.270 --> 11:00.330
Probably you remember this very well from from school.

11:00.360 --> 11:08.250
This is a very important equation that pops up almost everywhere in mathematics, physics, engineering

11:08.610 --> 11:11.250
and all the practical applications.

11:12.270 --> 11:21.360
For example, it helps establish the distance between two points in space once the coordinates are given,

11:21.870 --> 11:24.450
as we see in the next sections.

11:26.670 --> 11:34.410
Finally, recall the use of the great Greek capital letter sigma for the summation.

11:35.480 --> 11:43.240
Some examples you can see here, for example, for example, summation from one to N with the index,

11:43.250 --> 11:49.640
I know A in A is given one plus two plus three plus and so on.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.570
And you write it.

11:50.570 --> 12:01.640
And then in this way, the same thing for the sum some of the squares from again from one to N or this

12:01.650 --> 12:05.960
and you sum over I square and you get.

12:06.470 --> 12:06.810
Yeah.

12:06.890 --> 12:07.170
What.

12:07.230 --> 12:07.940
What this.

12:09.680 --> 12:18.290
Compact form symbolism means is that you are coming over and the numbers and the sequence of one plus

12:18.290 --> 12:20.630
four plus nine and so on.

12:21.740 --> 12:31.970
Or what we will see very frequently, you have just to sum over indexed numbers, but possibly also

12:31.970 --> 12:44.450
complex numbers, as we will see, and you have here this symbology, the sum of C I squared up from

12:44.840 --> 12:54.140
I equal one to N means Siwa C one squared plus plus C, two squared plus three.

12:55.090 --> 12:58.420
Squared, plus, plus, plus, plus CNN squared.

12:59.640 --> 13:09.610
So these are just examples to give you an idea how this summation convention and this Greek letter,

13:09.670 --> 13:21.370
Capital Sigma, is used throughout the text or in all mathematical and treatises of physics.

13:21.870 --> 13:25.050
And just to remember what it means.

13:28.820 --> 13:36.720
Another bit of knowledge, mathematical knowledge that they must bring with you in this course, uh,

13:36.870 --> 13:41.430
are Cartesian coordinate systems, scholars and vectors.

13:42.720 --> 13:50.250
Cartesian coordinates are numbers which indicate the location of a point relative to a fixed reference

13:50.250 --> 14:02.290
point, the the origin being its shortest perpendicular distances from two fixed axis or three planes

14:02.310 --> 14:08.430
defined by three fixed axis, which intersect at right angles at the origin.

14:09.960 --> 14:19.530
By doing so, one can uniquely identify any point in a two dimensional or three dimensional space by

14:19.530 --> 14:24.590
a set of two or three numerical coordinates respectively.

14:26.720 --> 14:34.610
The two dimensional Cartesian plane is subdivided in four so-called quadrants and the three dimensional

14:34.610 --> 14:37.640
volume volume in eight quadrants.

14:38.910 --> 14:43.560
Think of it as just a way to pinpoint objects in space.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.050
That is on a graph or a map.

14:48.790 --> 14:51.160
It's nothing but a complicated.

14:53.190 --> 15:03.560
In this figure here, for example, the two points, P three, five and Q three or five in the two dimensional

15:03.560 --> 15:12.470
and three dimensional space respectively can be pinpoint and can be located and identified in a two

15:12.470 --> 15:14.510
dimensional or three dimensional space.

15:15.270 --> 15:25.280
And that's obviously a way, a method to identify the position of particles moving in space, in space,

15:25.280 --> 15:27.500
in time and in physics typically.

15:30.890 --> 15:40.430
In a coordinated system, one can represent more than just points in space, namely also vectors, vectors

15:40.430 --> 15:47.370
are quantities given by a collection of numbers and that graphically can be represented by arrows or

15:47.540 --> 15:48.490
just simple as that.

15:48.830 --> 15:56.090
Imagine an arrow, an arrow that have a specific length and direction.

15:56.810 --> 16:03.560
So it's an arrow that indicates in some direction and has some length in physics.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.900
Lots of physical quantities are.

16:08.100 --> 16:17.160
Designated with vectors, uh, in this figure, for example, the two red arrows, not how four vectors,

16:17.370 --> 16:23.590
the coordinates are written, one over the other to distinguish it from point coordinates.

16:24.960 --> 16:32.700
A practical example is the velocity of an object moving in space and which has a direction at the speed.

16:33.930 --> 16:41.640
The speed is given by the length of the vector and the direction.

16:42.690 --> 16:50.760
Of the arrow is just the direction of the particle which moves with that given speed.

16:53.600 --> 17:01.490
The velocity is a vector, while the speed is just a number that tells us how fast the object moves

17:01.490 --> 17:04.070
without specification of any direct.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.110
This letter kind of quantity is called also Escala.

17:10.470 --> 17:20.370
Just a number, which is is not a vector or if you prefer, it's a zero dimensional vector, an acceleration

17:20.520 --> 17:29.730
or a force are also vectors, since one needs the direction along which they move or act to where the.

17:30.850 --> 17:41.450
Acceleration has also a direction, a force indicates also and direction along which it acts and an

17:41.490 --> 17:47.050
acceleration has an absolute value as a force.

17:49.340 --> 17:58.490
And this gives me the length of the acceleration vector or of the force vector.

18:00.370 --> 18:05.230
Whereas other SKALLA quantities could be, for instance, the temperature.

18:06.300 --> 18:08.970
Or the mass of an object?

18:09.980 --> 18:17.900
These are just numbers and have no direction, no direction is needed to specify a temperature or mass

18:18.800 --> 18:19.540
of an object.

18:20.390 --> 18:26.680
So this is important that you are able to distinguish the principle in principle.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.810
What color is color quantity?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.300
Just a number and a vector.

18:32.090 --> 18:40.910
Both describe physical properties of things that are mathematically very different ones.

18:40.910 --> 18:41.540
Just a number.

18:41.540 --> 18:43.520
Another can be a two to.

18:44.850 --> 18:56.040
Error is two numbers or in two in two dimensional space or a narrow vector in a three dimensional space.

19:00.230 --> 19:04.790
And this means, obviously, you must be able to distinguish these two red.

19:06.020 --> 19:16.190
Vectors that we show here, one two dimensional space, which has coordinates 10 and seven and the other

19:16.190 --> 19:22.160
in a three dimensional space, which has coordinates 10, three and five.

19:24.660 --> 19:33.540
In general, Vector's can be added or subtracted the resulting vector from the addition of two parallel

19:33.830 --> 19:38.860
or also called Kaleena vectors is simply the sum of its length.

19:40.200 --> 19:48.210
The resulting vector from the addition of two a. parallel opposite vectors is simply the different difference

19:48.210 --> 19:49.290
of its length.

19:50.880 --> 19:58.470
Meanwhile, generally, the resulting vector from the addition of two vectors with generic orientation

19:59.160 --> 20:07.860
is done according to the parallel parallelogram law of vector addition given to vectors.

20:08.870 --> 20:20.000
Let's call them the one and we to the vector, some V equals V one plus V2 is just the diagonal of its

20:20.000 --> 20:24.980
vector parallel parallelogram as shown in this figure here.

20:26.920 --> 20:37.060
Analytically, this is realized by adding the Cartesian components of each vector to one another.

20:38.320 --> 20:47.080
For example, if you wish, I showed it here, but draw it also by yourself on a piece of paper and

20:47.080 --> 20:57.700
check by yourself that the vector two or three plus six one gives as a resulting vector, thanks to

20:57.700 --> 20:59.530
the parallelogram law.

21:00.430 --> 21:03.910
The vector result in vector eight for.

21:05.630 --> 21:13.490
This is just quite simple and useful method for some investors because because all physical quantities,

21:14.030 --> 21:21.710
such as velocity's forces, also polarisation, electromagnetic fields, magnetic momentum and much

21:21.710 --> 21:23.180
more are vectors.

21:23.450 --> 21:33.230
And that can be added according to the parallelogram law of a vector can also be multiplied with another

21:33.230 --> 21:33.750
vector.

21:34.550 --> 21:39.020
It is the so-called Schallert product or DOT product.

21:39.800 --> 21:45.260
One takes as takes the product of each Cartesian component

21:48.140 --> 21:51.990
of each vector and adds them up.

21:52.820 --> 21:55.130
Not that this furnishes aspect as color.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.110
That is a number.

21:57.530 --> 22:04.730
For example, here you can see you just take two times six plus three times one and this gives 15.

22:04.730 --> 22:14.990
It's no notice also that if two vectors are perpendicular perpendicular to each other, their product

22:14.990 --> 22:15.920
is always zero.

22:16.700 --> 22:19.040
For example, here you can see an example.

22:19.050 --> 22:23.240
Check it by yourself and you see that these must be perpendicular.

22:23.240 --> 22:31.700
And you just can also draw it on a piece of paper to check if this is if this is true to mutually perpendicular

22:31.700 --> 22:34.790
vectors are said to be orthogonal vectors.

22:35.450 --> 22:41.110
If they also have a unique length one, they are said to be all four normal vectors.

22:42.080 --> 22:52.730
So this little check, uh, is is very useful to see if two given vectors are somehow orthogonal or

22:52.730 --> 22:55.150
perpendicular or so normal to each other.

22:55.730 --> 23:05.030
And this will frequently happen to be the case in the algebra that we use in quantum mechanics.
