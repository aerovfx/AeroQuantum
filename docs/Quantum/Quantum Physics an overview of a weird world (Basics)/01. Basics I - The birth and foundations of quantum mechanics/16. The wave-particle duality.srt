00:00.690 --> 00:09.060
Almost everyone has sooner or later heard something about the famous wave particle duality, so much

00:09.060 --> 00:13.350
has been said about it and so many misconceptions surround it.

00:14.370 --> 00:20.580
One of the most frequent misconceptions is that which sounds more or less as follows.

00:21.480 --> 00:28.740
A particle can be sometimes a wave or a particle, depending on the observer.

00:30.570 --> 00:38.100
Apart from the fact that similar phrases, similar statements are already self-contradictory statements,

00:38.970 --> 00:43.200
if a particle acts as a wave, it is not a particle in the first place.

00:44.160 --> 00:52.830
That is why some physicists would like to eliminate altogether from textbooks any reference to dualities.

00:53.930 --> 01:03.860
But one of the aims of this course is to debunk the observer myth in quantum physics, know quantum

01:03.860 --> 01:14.000
phenomena needs a human mind or human consciousness observing anything, and there is no particle transmutations

01:14.000 --> 01:19.010
in the sense that our naive intuition tends to suggest.

01:20.300 --> 01:28.010
It is no coincidence that we intentionally introduced it somewhat later, dwelling first into a historical

01:28.010 --> 01:34.340
and conceptual introduction in order to furnish you the premises to understand the deeper meaning and

01:34.340 --> 01:43.970
implications of the wave particle duality, as also in the next lecture, Heisenberg's principle, uncertainty

01:43.970 --> 01:44.640
principle.

01:45.350 --> 01:54.350
We have seen that photons, and especially in the case of observable light, can behave either as waves

01:54.350 --> 01:59.840
or as particles according to the context and the experimental arrangement.

02:01.170 --> 02:09.990
For instance, the photoelectric effect or the content effect gives one answer and the double slit experiment

02:09.990 --> 02:12.740
and break the fraction, give the opposite answer.

02:13.980 --> 02:21.360
In the latter case, we have also seen how the wave character fits with material particles like electrons,

02:21.360 --> 02:23.520
protons and so on as well.

02:24.900 --> 02:34.050
However, we might ask at this point when, how and under which circumstances does the one or the other

02:34.080 --> 02:35.320
aspect arise?

02:36.090 --> 02:41.160
Is this a property that quantum objects acquire, switching from one state to another?

02:42.000 --> 02:50.520
Is there somehow a moment, an instant in time where and not better defined entity is or behaves like

02:50.520 --> 02:56.230
a particle and after afterwards morphs into a wave?

02:57.240 --> 03:04.740
If so, does this happen in a continuous fashion or instantly, or is there another possible interpretation

03:04.740 --> 03:13.530
and understanding which unites unites the two aspects of photons as waves and as matter and energy?

03:15.520 --> 03:24.430
In some sense, we have already seen how with the Braly hypothesis, it is possible to unify this disparity

03:24.610 --> 03:26.980
with the concept of the Wave packett.

03:28.270 --> 03:31.570
Therefore, so far we have shed some light.

03:32.470 --> 03:38.560
Here's the pun is intended on this wave with wave particle duality.

03:39.400 --> 03:47.710
But the picture is still somewhat incomplete because if we think about it carefully, nobody has seen

03:47.710 --> 03:53.570
a light wave as we can observe water waves on the surface of an ocean, for example.

03:54.640 --> 04:05.020
What we always observe are the effects of something that we imagine by deduction after the fact to be

04:05.020 --> 04:07.170
something that acts like a wave.

04:08.590 --> 04:16.870
The several experiments that hinted at the particle or wave character of light did not show that light

04:16.870 --> 04:24.320
is a particle or is a wave, but that it behaves like a particle or a waves.

04:24.830 --> 04:25.380
A wave.

04:25.870 --> 04:26.920
That's the difference.

04:27.610 --> 04:36.520
We should not confuse our human mental, sometimes even ideological projections of how reality appears

04:37.090 --> 04:38.890
with reality itself.

04:40.950 --> 04:49.620
It is here, therefore, where Young's famous double slit experiment comes into play again in its modern

04:49.620 --> 04:59.340
quantum version, it clarifies further some very important aspects and shed more light also literally

05:00.240 --> 05:04.110
on the nature of physical objects in quantum physics.

05:05.650 --> 05:15.310
So let us turn back to the young stubbles, little experiment and revise it and to see it from a different

05:15.310 --> 05:16.000
perspective.

05:18.110 --> 05:26.060
We have here again the transverse plane, wavefront of light, say just a beam of light coming from

05:26.060 --> 05:34.730
a source which ideally is highly monochromatic, that is having a single or very narrow range of wavelengths

05:34.730 --> 05:40.310
and colors nowadays, an easy task to accomplish with laser light.

05:41.720 --> 05:48.740
We know that the slits should have a size and separation which should be comparable with that of the

05:48.740 --> 05:50.780
wavelength of the incoming light.

05:51.440 --> 06:00.730
Something something which even for small wavelengths, can be achieved with high precision using model

06:01.100 --> 06:03.080
lithographic technologies.

06:04.850 --> 06:13.160
When the plane wave years plane where it goes goes through the slits, it is refracted and is detected,

06:13.490 --> 06:20.000
detected with a screen at some distance and the usual resulting interference pattern appears.

06:21.080 --> 06:28.210
These fringes can be easily photographed with photographic plate or CCD camera nowadays, usually a

06:28.680 --> 06:37.190
camera or whatever kind of sensor sensitive to that wavelength we are working with.

06:39.090 --> 06:45.360
With Yang's experiment, the question about the nature of light seemed to receive a clear answer.

06:46.140 --> 06:54.240
We conceive light as a wave since it behaves like a wave because of the typical interference phenomenon,

06:54.540 --> 06:59.340
exactly as we expected it for waves.

07:00.880 --> 07:10.510
But let us see what the more or less unaware assumption is that stands behind this conclusion, the

07:10.510 --> 07:18.790
more or less unaware and unconscious logical background of this conclusion relies on what is called

07:18.790 --> 07:20.270
the dark test.

07:21.010 --> 07:22.540
That's what philosophers.

07:23.600 --> 07:33.980
Used to say, or more precisely, more scientific terms, the objective or retroactive reasoning and

07:33.980 --> 07:43.100
which states that if something looks like a duck, swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it

07:43.100 --> 07:44.720
probably is a duck.

07:46.640 --> 07:53.770
This is what in quantum mechanics, philosophers, philosophers mean by counterfactual definiteness,

07:54.140 --> 08:03.890
that is the ability to assume the existence of properties of objects even when they have not been measured

08:04.070 --> 08:04.820
directly.

08:06.550 --> 08:12.210
However, upon closer inspection, that turns out not to be the whole story.

08:13.240 --> 08:17.560
Let us turn to the moral schematic representation of the double slit experiment.

08:18.920 --> 08:28.880
Here we see again the incoming planer wavefront that the diffract, the circular wavefront and the internal

08:28.880 --> 08:32.450
interference fringes appearing on the detector plain.

08:34.100 --> 08:42.770
If we look more precisely at the microscopic level, what happens then we would realize that things

08:42.800 --> 08:53.360
are turned upside down because what finally is detected are always and only interactions between the

08:53.360 --> 08:58.940
light and the detector screen in tiny localized spots.

09:00.710 --> 09:06.140
Let us take, for instance, this little localized pest and magnify it.

09:07.100 --> 09:15.950
Say, for instance, using a microscope or whatever, then what one observes locally is not some nice

09:15.950 --> 09:23.960
continuous shading of the intensity between the black and white fringes, but we always observe a random

09:24.170 --> 09:32.420
distribution of points that is of point, like localized interactions on the detection screen, just

09:32.420 --> 09:34.430
like pixels on a monitor.

09:36.100 --> 09:42.070
For instance, if we use as our detecting screen and old conventional photographic plate.

09:43.240 --> 09:53.110
Develop it and then look at the photograph under a microscope, magnifying the region of the interference

09:53.110 --> 10:01.330
pattern, we see many tiny white spots which correspond to the grains that due to the chemical reaction,

10:01.870 --> 10:03.290
became white.

10:03.310 --> 10:11.050
If a photon is absorbed or black, no, like no black or white, according if you look at the negative

10:11.050 --> 10:14.970
or the positive development plate.

10:16.840 --> 10:24.490
So, after all, when we make a measurement, what we ultimately observe are particles, not waves.

10:25.920 --> 10:32.760
Be it a photographic plate, a modern CCD sensor or any other kind of detector which responds to an

10:32.760 --> 10:42.240
electric signal or just clicks like a photo died or photomultiplier, what we really measure up one

10:42.270 --> 10:49.910
or many dots, that is local point like interactions with form, an internal interference pattern.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.950
But we never see a continuous pattern.

10:54.480 --> 11:03.300
Even if we would build a detector, which with with the highest resolution possible, say every pixel

11:03.300 --> 11:08.850
is an atom, the same dot, that interference pattern would emerge at smaller scales.

11:10.450 --> 11:16.990
This should not come as a surprise, since already, from what we have learned about the black body

11:16.990 --> 11:24.820
radiation theory, we know that matter and therefore atoms and molecules absorb quanta and not in a

11:24.820 --> 11:30.820
continuous fashion, but in form of discrete, discrete amounts of energy.

11:32.160 --> 11:39.800
Therefore, also in Yang's experiment, we recover and find again the corpuscular nature of light,

11:40.530 --> 11:46.990
what seems to be directed at the slits and interferes on the screen behaves like a wave.

11:47.670 --> 11:52.380
But what is finally observed are photons hitting the screen.

11:53.430 --> 11:58.980
On one side, we have something we imagine to be a wave that goes through the double slit.

11:59.490 --> 12:07.440
But at last, when we attempt to detect it, then nevertheless it shows up always and inevitably as

12:07.440 --> 12:09.060
a localized interaction.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.240
In a certain sense, we find ourselves again at a starting point.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.740
What is a photon really?

12:17.280 --> 12:24.780
If it is a wave, why when we when and how does it become a particle in order to be detected as a point

12:24.780 --> 12:25.590
like structure?

12:26.850 --> 12:33.270
Let us further inspect the state of affairs, if we maintain strictly the particle picture, then we

12:33.270 --> 12:40.230
must assume that at this slits, each particle must go through one or the other slit and then travel

12:40.230 --> 12:47.850
further in the direction of the detection screen and there show up at one or the other fringe.

12:48.660 --> 12:57.420
That is, we have two sets of piled up particles detected only in two locations at the detector screen.

12:58.760 --> 13:08.900
However, we know all too well that this is not the case, since we observe the all larger set of interference

13:08.900 --> 13:17.660
fringes, there are also other lines, so to speak, appearing this naive picture is simply disproved

13:17.660 --> 13:18.380
by facts.

13:20.550 --> 13:26.660
If we still believe that there are only particles, we are forced to assume that something like it and

13:26.700 --> 13:35.790
this figure in the lower right massacre, one has to assume the existence of some not well defined wave

13:35.790 --> 13:45.650
or force of of field that guides the particle along their path so that they match the interference fringes.

13:46.110 --> 13:47.350
But there is no wave.

13:48.840 --> 13:55.590
This is an interpretation that is indeed taken seriously by some physicists with the so-called pilot

13:55.590 --> 14:00.200
wave theory originally formulated by the American physicist David Bohm.

14:01.200 --> 14:09.180
But before going into speculations that have no hard evidence supporting them, I strongly suggest you

14:09.180 --> 14:17.850
follow and learn first what so far is known for sure before jumping into the plethora of interpretations

14:17.850 --> 14:18.870
of quantum mechanics.

14:20.190 --> 14:27.330
In fact, let us make a further step in our reasoning and ask ourselves what happens if only one photon

14:27.330 --> 14:28.920
is sent towards the double slit?

14:30.510 --> 14:38.460
Do interference, for instance, arise also with one eye, with a single photon, or are they the result?

14:38.910 --> 14:41.240
Just interpret the interference fringes?

14:41.250 --> 14:48.270
Are they the result of the collective interactions of many photons or which seems to be another possible

14:48.270 --> 14:49.640
alternative interpretation?

14:49.890 --> 14:53.460
Does even a single particle interfere with itself?

14:55.280 --> 15:01.220
The question might look at first meaningless because we might object that there is no way to say if

15:01.220 --> 15:08.030
a single photon is subjected to interference, since to observe these interference phenomena, we need

15:08.030 --> 15:12.090
a collection of photons to build up as fringes on the screen.

15:12.860 --> 15:16.250
However, there is a way to test this hypothesis.

15:16.940 --> 15:25.580
In fact, an idea to try to deceive nature could be to look and see if and how the interference pattern

15:25.760 --> 15:26.590
builds up.

15:26.900 --> 15:37.340
If we sent only one photon after another and see how things develop over time, one after another means

15:37.340 --> 15:40.420
that we shoot a single photon at the 2s.

15:40.430 --> 15:48.350
Let's wait until the single photon hits the screen and record its position on the detector screen.

15:49.040 --> 15:56.270
And only after that we send the next photon weight again until it is detected on the screen and so on.

15:58.340 --> 16:07.160
Experimentally, this is not easy, but even so, not too difficult to accomplish by making the light

16:07.160 --> 16:08.740
source extremely dim.

16:08.930 --> 16:16.790
For example, just take a at source and limit with some almost black foil in such a manner that it emits

16:16.790 --> 16:18.740
only one photon at a time.

16:19.220 --> 16:24.770
And you should know by now that this is precisely what metter always does.

16:24.800 --> 16:32.390
If you recall what we have said about the black body radiation and atomic transition spectra, then

16:32.540 --> 16:37.460
the single photon is forced to go through one slit or the other slit.

16:38.270 --> 16:45.800
If it is a particle, as we imagine it being in our naive intuition, then it can't go through both

16:45.800 --> 16:46.280
slits.

16:47.540 --> 16:54.230
If this particle travels through the first slit, then one expects to find it colliding, colliding

16:54.230 --> 16:59.360
with the detector screen in the region of often of the upper fringe here.

17:00.260 --> 17:06.620
And when another particle goes through the second slit, then it is expected to hit the lower fringe

17:06.620 --> 17:07.040
here.

17:08.180 --> 17:17.390
So since we are sending only one photon at a time, this seems to be a method to force nature to manifest

17:17.390 --> 17:19.760
its crepuscular aspect.

17:21.890 --> 17:24.530
This experiment proceeds as follows.

17:24.920 --> 17:34.520
We produce only a very few photons at a time and then look at what we see at the detection screen after

17:34.520 --> 17:35.990
a short time interval.

17:37.640 --> 17:46.520
As you can observe here, only a few photons are distributed in an apparently random manner all over

17:46.550 --> 17:51.800
the area where previously we observed the interference fringes.

17:53.320 --> 17:59.800
So there is no hint that interference, of course, and we are happy with that, we believed to have

17:59.800 --> 18:07.270
sent through the slits only one photon at a time, and we observe only tiny white spots as expected,

18:07.540 --> 18:15.430
even though the random displacement of the photon of the photons seems already to disprove the existence

18:15.430 --> 18:17.050
of only two lines.

18:18.160 --> 18:25.240
If we wait a little longer and collect more, even on the detector screen, one sees something like

18:25.240 --> 18:29.470
this and things look still clumpy.

18:29.800 --> 18:39.140
But now there seem definitely to be no trace of the two expected white lines at this stage of the experiment.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.150
However, one still cannot discover and clearly what the truth is.

18:44.890 --> 18:51.730
Then after some time where we have collected a sufficient number of events on the screen, we begin

18:51.730 --> 18:55.090
to observe indeed the interference fringes.

18:56.910 --> 19:04.440
And if we wait even longer and collect a large number of spots on the screen, finally the whole interference

19:04.440 --> 19:06.390
structure emerges.

19:08.450 --> 19:17.120
What we must conclude from this is that despite having deemed our source to such a degree that it emits

19:17.120 --> 19:23.090
only one photon at a time, the wave particle duality does not disappear.

19:24.300 --> 19:30.900
The interference phenomenon is not a collective phenomenon whereby we might imagine many light particles

19:30.900 --> 19:36.120
somehow interacting among themselves to produce the interference fringes.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.740
That's not the case.

19:38.220 --> 19:43.110
Also, single photons obey the interference law.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.420
And that's quite strange, isn't it?

19:48.280 --> 19:56.350
We might interpret the overall result as if the single particle goes through both slits at the same

19:56.350 --> 19:56.770
time.

19:57.790 --> 20:06.430
As a sort of ghostly wave that is subjected to the laws of diffraction and interference, but then when

20:06.430 --> 20:12.640
its position is measured, suddenly collapses to a single point at the at the detector screen.

20:14.120 --> 20:22.630
There it appears again as a little localized spot, the kind of classical model of reality we imagined

20:22.640 --> 20:30.350
whereby only a couple of localized fringes appear without interference is at this point dead and no

20:30.350 --> 20:30.800
longer.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.480
Tenable at all, it is simply wrong.

20:36.280 --> 20:43.870
What this shows instead is that as long as it is not observed, it travels and expands throughout space

20:43.870 --> 20:44.550
as a wave.

20:45.340 --> 20:52.600
But then when the act of measurement is performed, it chooses to place itself on a specific location.

20:54.100 --> 21:00.430
We see that something that seems to behave as a wave suddenly collapses to a point.

21:01.770 --> 21:06.120
We will never see the wave and particle nature at the same time.

21:08.260 --> 21:15.070
An important aspect always to keep in mind is that nevertheless, the process is completely random in

21:15.070 --> 21:23.300
the following sense is all what we have discussed so far is subjected to random law.

21:24.730 --> 21:28.900
We see clear and well-defined interference for infringers.

21:29.170 --> 21:36.400
We can say, what's the probability is where one photon displaces itself on which fringe?

21:36.730 --> 21:44.130
And it is never if it never displaces itself where the black fringes are.

21:44.860 --> 21:52.300
And we can describe this very well mathematically with an interference function, with a wave function.

21:53.590 --> 22:03.220
But we will never be able to say that this that precisely that single photon will displace itself on

22:03.220 --> 22:06.190
that fringe in this location.

22:08.390 --> 22:15.620
Where are we to look at this interference pattern only at a small local scale, again, say with a microscope

22:15.890 --> 22:24.140
and without knowing how the rest of the interference picture is made, there would be no way to know

22:24.140 --> 22:30.440
if the single white dot on the Texas screen is the result of an interference phenomenon through the

22:30.440 --> 22:38.000
two slits or simply a single photon coming from a source with or without the slits in between.

22:39.430 --> 22:46.420
It is only when we look at the global picture that we can infer from it that interference must have

22:46.420 --> 22:47.230
taken place.

22:48.490 --> 22:54.840
In this sense, we say that quantum physics is governed by purely probabilistic laws.

22:55.720 --> 23:02.890
We can only say that there is a certain probability that a photon is detected in a specific position.

23:03.790 --> 23:11.480
But never, ever will we be able to tell in advance what this single event will turn out to be.

23:12.220 --> 23:15.850
We can only tell what will happen statistically.

23:16.390 --> 23:25.330
That is, after a high number of events have taken place and become statistically significant when a

23:25.330 --> 23:28.540
statistically significant number of even's is collected.

23:29.470 --> 23:36.430
The overall disposition of the photons on the detection plane always obeys the classical interference

23:36.430 --> 23:43.490
law with its typical geometric disposition of the dark and white fringe pattern.

23:44.320 --> 23:50.620
The signal, even, however, that is the displacement of a single photon on one or the other.

23:50.620 --> 23:53.530
French is a purely probabilistic event.

23:54.690 --> 24:01.500
There is a high probability that the single photon will be detected on the brighter fringes, but there

24:01.500 --> 24:09.270
is no way, no method at all, even not in principle, to tell in advance which of the fringes the single

24:09.270 --> 24:14.460
photon on which on which of the fringe is a single photon will be detected.

24:17.400 --> 24:25.110
This hints at the quite different conception then what we intend in classical physics with the word

24:25.590 --> 24:28.710
randomness, chance or coincidence.

24:30.150 --> 24:38.880
In classical physics, the face that stands up by tossing a dyes, for example, is a random event in

24:38.880 --> 24:47.370
the sense that the physical process, which determines how the dice rolls on a table, is so complicated,

24:47.640 --> 24:55.350
so complicated and practically impossible to calculate that the outcome is simply unpredictable.

24:56.460 --> 24:59.040
But think about it in principle.

24:59.160 --> 25:06.480
If you would know everything about the dice, the forces that act on the dice, how it is thrown on

25:06.480 --> 25:13.530
the table, every and we know every detail about the table itself and the precise initial conditions

25:13.530 --> 25:16.320
of the system of the dice and so on.

25:17.070 --> 25:25.050
We could ideally predict the outcome, say, with a supercomputer that knows everything about the laws

25:25.050 --> 25:28.110
of classical physics empiricism.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.170
In principle, that would not be impossible.

25:31.930 --> 25:40.840
Therefore, this concept, this classical concept of randomness and indeterminism is in reality only

25:40.840 --> 25:49.870
something that displays our displays our house, so to speak, ignorance on the initial conditions of

25:49.870 --> 25:56.520
the system and the precise values of the parameters that describe the state of the system.

25:57.310 --> 26:04.660
But in principle, if we have sufficient data and the exact initial conditions, we know everything

26:04.660 --> 26:11.560
about the system we could implement and we know everything about the classical laws of classical mechanics

26:11.560 --> 26:19.180
and physics, then in principle, it is not impossible to predict also the outcome of the tossing of

26:19.180 --> 26:19.720
a dice.

26:20.020 --> 26:20.260
Yeah.

26:20.560 --> 26:26.200
So in this sense, we must distinguish between these two types of indeterminism.

26:27.310 --> 26:36.280
The classical determinism has its roots in a way of thinking which is nicely summarized by the so-called

26:36.520 --> 26:37.750
Le plus Daymon.

26:39.360 --> 26:47.750
PFC Manolopoulos was a French mathematician and astronomer of the 19th century who isn't as follows.

26:49.410 --> 26:57.510
We may regard the present state of the universe as the affect of its past and the course of its future

26:58.500 --> 27:07.590
and intellect, which at a certain moment would know all forces that said nature in motion and all positions

27:07.590 --> 27:10.740
of all items of which nature is composed.

27:11.430 --> 27:20.610
If this intellect were also vast enough to submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single

27:20.610 --> 27:27.840
formula the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom.

27:28.620 --> 27:32.550
For such an intellect, nothing would be uncertain.

27:32.760 --> 27:39.180
And the future future, just like the past, would be present before its eyes.

27:41.280 --> 27:50.610
This conception, this idea of determinism is more or less consciously still the leading paradigm in

27:50.610 --> 28:00.180
most sciences until today is someone themen in this case knows the precise position and momentum of

28:00.180 --> 28:02.070
every particle in the universe.

28:02.760 --> 28:10.530
Its dynamic evolution for any given time could be calculated with certainty from the laws of physics.

28:13.050 --> 28:22.020
But we will see repeatedly during this journey through the weird world of quantum physics that this

28:22.020 --> 28:23.460
is an assumption that.

28:24.340 --> 28:32.680
Can no longer be considered true in the quantum domain, or at least we have strong indications that

28:32.680 --> 28:40.450
it might be not longer be true, even if we know everything about the solar system and the initial condition

28:41.380 --> 28:43.420
of a single particle.

28:43.640 --> 28:48.040
Yeah, the single event will remain forever unpredictable.

28:48.910 --> 28:53.860
And this not because of our ignorance as a plus believed.

28:54.370 --> 29:01.440
And even if we have a demon knowing everything and being able to calculate quickly and precisely enough

29:01.450 --> 29:09.760
everything, in any case, quantum mechanics, this is not allowed, nevertheless, to know the future

29:09.940 --> 29:11.320
with absolute precision.

29:11.830 --> 29:19.600
We can make only statistical prediction predictions, but not a certain prediction about a single event.

29:20.800 --> 29:25.960
It seems that in quantum mechanics, things are not random in the classical sense.

29:26.470 --> 29:32.050
But this randomness is an inherent feature and aspect of nature.

29:33.680 --> 29:38.600
We shall take up this issue again, also in the next lecturer's.

29:40.070 --> 29:50.080
Meanwhile, if you have followed what we learned about the electron and neutron diffraction, it should

29:50.180 --> 29:57.260
not come as this point, as a surprise that the wave particle duality is something that holds for material

29:57.260 --> 29:58.460
particles as well.

29:59.660 --> 30:07.910
In fact, the double slit experiment that Young performed with light gives exactly the same result again,

30:08.130 --> 30:13.310
if you use electrons or other material particles instead of photons.

30:14.860 --> 30:22.420
Therefore, the only thing we can say for sure can be represented with these pictures.

30:24.450 --> 30:32.670
Before the detection of anything, we should only imagine waits or more precisely, meter waves in the

30:32.670 --> 30:34.440
case of material particles.

30:35.760 --> 30:44.990
First, a plane wave hitting the screen and after the two slits, the two concentric wave fronts.

30:46.290 --> 30:54.750
Once these hit the screen, they interact with it according to a probability amplitude dictated by the

30:54.750 --> 30:56.140
interference amplitudes.

30:56.580 --> 31:03.540
And suddenly this wave collapses onto a single spot at the detection site.

31:05.040 --> 31:11.340
This is what the wave particle duality is about, the wave particle duality is about an object that

31:11.340 --> 31:18.580
propagates and spreads out throughout space, behaving and interfering like a wave.

31:19.620 --> 31:26.940
But when asked as to its whereabouts, it answers as a point like interaction.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.320
More than that, we can't say.

31:32.330 --> 31:39.380
So at this point, we should begin to become accustomed to the idea that there is no particle and neither

31:39.500 --> 31:49.400
neither wave at all in the first place, but only a physical phenomenon which should not which we should

31:49.400 --> 31:56.660
not even attempt to visualize with our human intuitive, macroscopic understanding of the world.

31:57.770 --> 32:06.620
The nature of matter can be described only in terms of probability waves on or probability loss.

32:07.710 --> 32:14.790
Note also how we coincidentally are talking about something, the grave nature of photons or matter

32:15.570 --> 32:25.690
without detecting and measuring any wave at all, but inferring its existence only indirectly are posteriorly.

32:26.220 --> 32:33.600
That is after the measurement of its particle nature by looking afterwards at the interference pattern,

32:34.020 --> 32:42.420
which consists of several white spots, we talk of meter waves not by seeing waves at all.

32:42.840 --> 32:43.740
Quite the contrary.

32:44.520 --> 32:53.280
Paradoxically, we deduce the wave nature of matter only when several measurements of particle like

32:53.280 --> 32:58.210
objects have been performed, as we shall see later.

32:58.530 --> 33:06.540
This is a prelude to a typical situation occurring frequently in quantum physics, the kind of situation

33:06.540 --> 33:16.650
where we tend to reconstruct in our mind and presumed objective reality a model of something which is,

33:16.650 --> 33:24.600
however, already in the past and no longer in the present, but by looking at the effects it produced.

33:25.580 --> 33:33.260
We are looking, therefore, what the effects are from that we did use a wavelike nature or whatever

33:33.260 --> 33:42.530
kind we come to, what ever kind of conclusion, we tend to believe there was a wave in the past, despite

33:42.530 --> 33:47.030
the fact that we observe only particles in the present time.

33:48.230 --> 33:53.030
It is just this logical reverse engineering, so to speak.

33:53.510 --> 34:00.380
And the question of how far we are allowed to resort to this kind of reasoning, quantum physics that

34:00.380 --> 34:06.590
has given so many headaches to generations of physicists and philosophers.

34:06.590 --> 34:15.440
Also, honestly, we really don't know what these objects we call photons, electrons, protons and

34:15.440 --> 34:16.940
neutrons really are.

34:17.960 --> 34:25.670
We even are no longer sure if it makes sense at all to ask for a description of reality that is supposed

34:25.670 --> 34:34.700
to have an object on an objective existence and ontology independent from our mental models.

34:36.490 --> 34:45.010
The fact is that physical reality must be a bit more complicated and counterintuitive than what we thought

34:45.010 --> 34:45.560
it to be.

34:46.480 --> 34:54.340
We have to deal with phenomena that refuse to be forced into an objective, ontological worldview made

34:54.340 --> 35:01.600
of classical objects, independent from the act of measurement, at least not in the classical Newtonian

35:01.600 --> 35:06.420
physics sense in the world out there, so to speak.

35:06.430 --> 35:13.690
There is something that produces effects, which in turn become the causes of future events.

35:14.170 --> 35:22.810
And that tell us tells us I am a particle when you look at me, but as long as you don't look at me,

35:23.050 --> 35:26.070
I will continue to behave like a wave.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.600
And it's not saying I am a wave.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.160
I behave like a wave.

35:32.220 --> 35:37.770
Whereas from the mathematical, purely mathematical and abstract point of view, there is no problem

35:37.770 --> 35:45.210
at all with this, we just make all of our calculations with our unnice with packets and wave propagation

35:45.210 --> 35:52.950
and interference laws and obtain as an answer that which is confirmed by the experimental results.

35:53.970 --> 36:01.410
However, from the ontological point of view, things are not as easy as that it does.

36:01.440 --> 36:08.460
It is not clear what quantum physics is trying to tell us really here about the physical world and if

36:08.460 --> 36:12.340
it makes sense to speak about objective realities at all.

36:13.620 --> 36:22.650
This aspect has puzzled the best minds of science and philosophy and continues to do so until the modern

36:22.650 --> 36:23.190
days.
