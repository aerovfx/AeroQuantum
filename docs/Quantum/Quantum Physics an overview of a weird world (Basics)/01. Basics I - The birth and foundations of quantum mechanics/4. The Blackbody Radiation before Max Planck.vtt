00:01.050 --> 00:09.270
We have seen that light or more generally, electromagnetic radiation interactions seem to behave like

00:09.270 --> 00:14.730
waves, not as tiny particles, that is point like particles.

00:15.900 --> 00:21.870
This was the state of the art knowledge until the end of the 19th century.

00:22.920 --> 00:31.620
Newton's like particle theory first somehow in disgrace and was degraded to a historical curiosity.

00:32.700 --> 00:42.900
But beginning from the 20th century, as time went by, new experiments and the great insights of many

00:42.900 --> 00:48.030
physicists indicated that this could not be the whole story.

00:49.410 --> 00:57.960
In fact, about the end of the 19th century, physicists had to tackle with a very ugly and uncomfortable

00:57.960 --> 00:58.440
problem.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.750
The question was why?

01:01.800 --> 01:06.660
And according to which principles, two hot bodies radiate heat.

01:08.080 --> 01:16.840
The answer that classical physics stubbornly gave was totally unacceptable, according according to

01:16.840 --> 01:24.400
classical physics, every object which is not frozen at the chilling absolute zero temperature must

01:24.400 --> 01:29.650
radiate, radiate an infinite amount of heat in form of electromagnetic waves.

01:30.940 --> 01:38.890
For example, according to quantum physics, which rests on classical premises, even a block of ice,

01:39.790 --> 01:48.770
which is not frozen down to a temperature of minus 273 point one five Celsius.

01:48.790 --> 01:51.100
That is absolutely absolute zero.

01:51.790 --> 02:00.070
Even if it is, say, even only one degree above this limit, then it must emit an infinite energy and

02:00.070 --> 02:04.930
destroy the entire universe in a catastrophic explosion.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.990
This was what classical physics was continuously, continuously suggesting.

02:11.440 --> 02:21.280
Every attempt of the best minds of the time led them to calculations and formulas for the emitted energy

02:21.280 --> 02:27.610
of a body at Fenet, but non-zero temperature that inevitably always diverged.

02:27.730 --> 02:32.590
That is, which showed to tend to infinity for a long time.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.820
There seemed to be no way around this absurd conclusion.

02:38.350 --> 02:47.050
Such kind of paradox is what the famous philosopher of science, Thomas Kuhn, called an anomaly that

02:47.050 --> 02:53.680
is a violation of the paradigm induced expectations that govern, govern normal science.

02:54.250 --> 03:00.850
Or to put it in simple terms, the current theories predict something very different, eventually even

03:00.850 --> 03:05.170
paradoxical, and which does not match with reality.

03:05.170 --> 03:07.810
And eventually, it seems, also not to make any sense.

03:09.580 --> 03:17.620
The solution of this problem marked historically the advent of modern quantum theory in the last century.

03:18.070 --> 03:27.940
It was Max Planck, a German physicist, who about nineteen or five beautifully resolved the enigma

03:28.360 --> 03:30.880
and is considered for this reason.

03:30.880 --> 03:33.580
The father, the father of quantum physics.

03:35.200 --> 03:39.700
Let us analyze in more detail what this was all about.

03:41.510 --> 03:49.160
Consider a very hot magma from a volcano, for example, or in any case, more molten stones and rocks

03:49.160 --> 03:56.600
at high temperature as well known above some temperature, typically over several hundreds of degrees

03:56.600 --> 03:57.270
Celsius.

03:58.010 --> 04:00.330
Rocks begin to melt and become reddish.

04:00.890 --> 04:09.410
They emit red color radiation, which means that they emit electromagnetic waves at a wavelength or

04:09.410 --> 04:14.450
if you prefer, prefer a frequency that is visible to the human eye.

04:15.770 --> 04:23.090
The emitted the emitted electromagnetic waves, however, become invisible to us when the same rocks

04:23.420 --> 04:29.270
have a lower temperature, say, about 20 degrees or twenty seven degrees Celsius.

04:30.200 --> 04:37.790
The so-called room temperatures, this makes it clear that there must be a relation between the temperature

04:37.790 --> 04:45.140
of the body and the amount and frequency of the electromagnetic radiation it emits, which means the

04:45.140 --> 04:46.640
color it displays.

04:47.750 --> 04:54.180
Something similar can be said for lightning or the light emitted by the flame of candles.

04:55.010 --> 05:00.380
What happens in this case, in the first case is that there is an electric electric discharge which

05:00.380 --> 05:04.790
suddenly heats up the air extremely quickly to thousands of degrees.

05:05.210 --> 05:12.530
Or like in the case of a candle, there is a chemical reaction which heats up the surrounding air.

05:13.520 --> 05:19.400
We have a different substance with different temperatures, but again, we may ask it's the same relation

05:19.400 --> 05:25.760
between the colors that is the wavelength of the emitted electromagnetic waves and the temperature still

05:25.760 --> 05:26.300
holds.

05:28.180 --> 05:34.840
Another example is the case of a very hot metal at room temperatures, it does not emit any visible

05:34.840 --> 05:35.520
radiation.

05:36.190 --> 05:41.080
We will not be able to see it in the darkness with our eyes only.

05:41.110 --> 05:48.160
I mean, but if we heat up a piece of iron at several hundreds of degrees, then it will become visible

05:48.160 --> 05:52.240
also in the dark, emitting emitting first reddish radiation.

05:52.630 --> 05:59.890
And by increasing the temperature, it will become bluish and finally emit white radiation.

06:01.360 --> 06:08.980
But all this does not only happen in the visible domain domain of light, the truth is that every object

06:08.980 --> 06:13.170
and even our own bodies emit also radiation at room temperature.

06:14.050 --> 06:21.880
This radiation is not visible to the human eye, but exists nevertheless, for example, in the infrared

06:21.880 --> 06:22.390
domain.

06:23.500 --> 06:32.140
This can nicely visualized with the typical infrared images we are nowadays accustomed to see from especially

06:32.140 --> 06:36.250
from the military night vision helmets that modern soldiers wear.

06:37.000 --> 06:44.650
Infrared images can be acquired with special imaging video or CCD cameras, which are sensitive also

06:44.650 --> 06:46.030
to other wavelength.

06:46.060 --> 06:52.740
Then those human eye, the human eye perceives in this figure.

06:52.750 --> 06:57.250
Here you can see the head of a boy in perfect darkness.

06:58.570 --> 07:04.050
It becomes clear that our bodies emit electromagnetic waves, as LEMS do.

07:04.690 --> 07:09.120
We are just a sort of lamp in the infrared domain.

07:09.130 --> 07:10.930
However, it is not visible in light.

07:12.670 --> 07:21.190
Would our eyes be sensitive to the infrared radiation as indeed some species of snakes, fishes and

07:21.190 --> 07:22.150
mosquitoes are?

07:22.870 --> 07:28.510
We could easily see how even in perfect darkness we can.

07:28.530 --> 07:36.400
We can see the object, we could see the objects around us and they would appear to us as glowing.

07:38.620 --> 07:46.180
More generally, we can say that every object that has a non-zero absolute temperature emits some amount

07:46.180 --> 07:54.040
of radiation only in the case of a very extreme case where we would freeze it down to the absolute absolute

07:54.040 --> 08:00.880
zero temperature of zero kelvin to a temperature of about minus two hundred seventy three point fifteen

08:01.450 --> 08:09.820
degrees Celsius, which, by the way, is also a purely ideal case that, as we shall see later, is

08:09.820 --> 08:12.370
forbidden by the laws of quantum mechanics.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.930
Then it would no longer emit any radiation.

08:17.140 --> 08:24.790
But apart from that extreme case, everything emits some sort of heat in form of electromagnetic radiation

08:25.240 --> 08:26.920
on all wavelengths.

08:29.020 --> 08:36.190
It becomes reasonably reasonable then to assume that there must be some relation between the temperature

08:37.090 --> 08:47.590
of the body, the wavelength lamda of the electromagnetic wave it emits and the intensity of the of

08:47.590 --> 08:48.490
that radiation.

08:50.570 --> 08:56.420
To find out what this relation must be and what principles and phenomena stand behind the production

08:56.420 --> 09:04.550
of this radiation at microscopic scale, I mean, at the molecular and atomic scale, physicists reasoned

09:04.670 --> 09:12.970
in terms of the so-called black body model and which was and sounds as follows.

09:16.390 --> 09:20.450
Consider an empty body with a tiny hole hole in it.

09:20.950 --> 09:27.580
That is a cavity where we inject a beam of electromagnetic waves through that tiny aperture.

09:29.600 --> 09:37.310
Moreover, consider the walls inside this cavity is quite good, but not perfect reflectors so that

09:37.310 --> 09:46.850
light rays once in the cavity bounce back and forth many times distributing, distributing themselves

09:47.030 --> 09:55.070
homogeneously and yet can be absorbed sooner or later without finding their way out back through the

09:55.070 --> 09:55.760
small hole.

09:57.370 --> 10:04.840
This implies that all the radiation remains trapped inside the cavity and finally gets absorbed by the

10:04.840 --> 10:08.080
material, which makes up the containing walls.

10:09.610 --> 10:17.350
In other words, it is a perfectly black body since it absorbs all the radiation but is not but does

10:17.350 --> 10:18.490
not remit it.

10:18.490 --> 10:25.510
Back in physics, a black body is by definition a body that absorbs all the radiation.

10:25.810 --> 10:34.450
Technically, technically, one says it has a unitary absorb absorption coefficient and it does so at

10:34.450 --> 10:37.650
every wavelength and at every temperature.

10:38.110 --> 10:49.440
And this independently from the substance or form and structure of the of the absorbing cavity or body.

10:50.950 --> 10:58.680
This is, of course, only a very idealised model, since no real material object is a perfect absorber.

10:59.500 --> 11:04.560
But this kind of model is a good approximation for most cases of interest.

11:06.990 --> 11:14.670
The next step is to consider the cavity in stationary conditions and in thermodynamic equilibrium with

11:14.670 --> 11:22.620
the environment, which means that it must not change its temperature, tea or other physical parameters

11:22.620 --> 11:23.180
in time.

11:24.710 --> 11:31.880
If this condition is met, we can assume that the thermal electromagnetic radiation trapped inside the

11:31.880 --> 11:42.500
cavity will quickly distribute itself homogeneously, making the enclosure's temperature uniform throughout

11:42.500 --> 11:43.630
its structure.

11:45.070 --> 11:51.970
The system can therefore be characterized by its energy density, that is the amount of energy per unit

11:51.970 --> 11:58.960
volume independent of its temperature and wavelength, which do not depend from the shape, material

11:58.960 --> 12:00.780
or form and structure of the body.

12:01.930 --> 12:08.310
The energy lost through the tiny hole can be considered negligible or eventually can be replaced.

12:08.680 --> 12:17.050
Keeping the radiation energy density inside constant by injecting the same amount of energy from time

12:17.050 --> 12:19.540
to time as a cavity emits.

12:21.530 --> 12:28.750
The China purchase emission can also be used to look into the cavity without perturbing the system,

12:30.050 --> 12:37.520
and by doing so it reveals as the wavelength and intensity of the radiation it contains inside.

12:39.680 --> 12:46.430
At this point, it becomes clear why every material object in thermal equilibrium with them back with

12:46.430 --> 12:55.700
the environment can, despite a somewhat misleading terminology, be considered as a black body in this

12:55.700 --> 12:56.310
context?

12:56.330 --> 13:03.020
This should not be confused with the color or brightness of an object, because, for example, also

13:03.020 --> 13:11.480
the sun can be considered a black body in the sense physicists mean, since it is an object which maintains

13:11.480 --> 13:19.880
its temperature over a long period of time and the energy which is emitted into outer space is replaced

13:20.030 --> 13:23.360
by the energy it produces in its inner core.

13:25.080 --> 13:33.330
Physicists of the 19th 19th century consider the BlackBerry radiation cavity as a model that was supposed

13:33.330 --> 13:41.580
to describe, describe appropriately the electromagnetic energy content of any physical body with infinite

13:41.730 --> 13:42.450
temperature.

13:43.840 --> 13:50.470
The step from a qualitative to a more quantitative approach, which could describe with the formula

13:51.040 --> 13:59.680
the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body in function of its temperature t and

13:59.680 --> 14:08.830
wavelength the wavelength lambda or or equivalently its color and the visible domain considered the

14:08.830 --> 14:13.830
energy density of radiation per unit frequency, interval and unit volume.

14:14.530 --> 14:22.810
So this energy density function is defined as something that depends on the frequency and gives a number

14:22.810 --> 14:31.930
and energy density for each frequency and in a specific position and unit volume inside the cavity.

14:33.580 --> 14:42.010
This radiation, when in a stationary state, was modeled with what physicists call stationary or standing

14:42.010 --> 14:42.520
waves.

14:44.300 --> 14:53.570
These behave like electromagnetic waves in a box which are reflected back and forth and which do not

14:53.570 --> 15:03.230
interfere with each other destructively, building, oscillating, but stable with structures inside

15:03.380 --> 15:12.350
this box, standing waves are precisely all those that have only the wavelength that match the cavity

15:12.350 --> 15:17.660
walls with that zero amplitude as shown in this figure.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.120
As an allergy.

15:22.180 --> 15:25.800
Think of swinging a rod fixed at the wall eventually.

15:25.870 --> 15:27.280
Try this by yourself.

15:27.310 --> 15:35.890
This experiment, fix the rod at the wall and on the other extreme, swing it up and down, producing

15:35.890 --> 15:44.470
a mechanical perturbation that propagates along the rod and which will be reflected from the wall.

15:45.760 --> 15:53.450
The reflected wave will interfere with the incoming one and into interference phenomena will occur.

15:54.640 --> 16:02.530
What you will easily discover is that only for some precise oscillation frequencies, you will be able

16:02.530 --> 16:05.560
to create a stable oscillation pattern.

16:07.660 --> 16:16.320
Therefore, standing waist can exist only at specific wavelengths called Mode's, only at these Moad

16:16.330 --> 16:20.770
frequencies, they interfere with itself constructively.

16:22.140 --> 16:25.690
For other frequencies, one observes disordered oscillations.

16:26.610 --> 16:36.840
So not every kind of electromagnetic waves can be contained in a cavity in stationary mode, but only

16:36.840 --> 16:40.410
those which match the right frequencies.

16:41.830 --> 16:49.170
Another way to experience this is by playing with the slinky, the Helliker metallic spring, the toy

16:49.600 --> 16:55.440
you certainly have played with sooner or later in your young age.

16:56.710 --> 17:03.160
And this is what I will show you now with this little presentation video.

17:05.820 --> 17:16.740
Here I have the famous Slinky, which is just a helical spring, but it is a toy I think that everyone

17:17.070 --> 17:26.810
has played with sooner or later and I continue to do this often also as an adult, I like it very much.

17:26.820 --> 17:34.620
And this object lends itself very well to illustrate the nature of waves.

17:35.520 --> 17:39.030
In this case, of course, we have mechanical waves.

17:41.040 --> 17:48.300
First of all, we must distinguish between transverse and longitudinal waves.

17:49.080 --> 17:56.730
Transverse waves are waves which oscillate perpendicular to the direction of motion.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.570
Yeah, so something like that.

18:01.510 --> 18:11.620
The direction of motion is back and forth, but the oscillation, the perturbation into this Hilik helical

18:11.620 --> 18:16.500
spring is perpendicular to the direction of motion.

18:16.870 --> 18:19.030
So can you like that?

18:19.630 --> 18:20.060
You see?

18:22.180 --> 18:27.790
It goes back and forth, but the oscillation is perpendicular.

18:32.530 --> 18:42.160
This is a typical transverse wavves with a transverse wave is characterized by also a polarization plane,

18:42.550 --> 18:45.100
that is, it can oscillate.

18:46.320 --> 18:56.340
In different directions, which means that I see something like that is a vertical direction, vertical

18:56.340 --> 18:58.920
polarisation or.

19:00.460 --> 19:01.120
This year.

19:02.360 --> 19:12.320
Is horizontal paralyzation something in between could be diagonal polarisation or whatever kind of polarization,

19:12.440 --> 19:21.470
you can rotate the plane of polarization, of this transversal transverse wave and particularly important

19:21.470 --> 19:29.810
for our purposes where we will deal with light, light has also rotational polarization.

19:30.500 --> 19:38.600
It can the polarization plain of the electric or magnetic field can rotate in time.

19:38.610 --> 19:48.830
So it is not stable and remains always vertical or always horizontal, but it is able to well, to vary

19:50.000 --> 19:55.030
in time, obviously clockwise or anticlockwise, one or the other.

19:55.790 --> 20:03.890
Then the other kind of wave that you can have is the longitudinal wave to the waves.

20:05.110 --> 20:13.090
Do not oscillate perpendicular to the direction of motion, but with the direction of motion that the

20:13.090 --> 20:21.850
perturbation, the oscillatory perturbation moves in the direction of propagation parallel to it.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.530
Well, OK, let's see.

20:23.950 --> 20:26.930
This means that it is not this kind of wave.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.930
Now it is.

20:31.540 --> 20:36.400
This kind of way, I don't know if you see it in the video, I'd give it a kick.

20:37.710 --> 20:40.230
You see, it goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.780
All right, let's do it another time.

20:43.390 --> 20:44.630
Uh, stop it.

20:45.420 --> 20:50.250
So and then and now there's a little transverse wave.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.190
Wait until it's damped out.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.530
So and then I give it a kick duck.

20:57.620 --> 20:58.400
And.

20:59.330 --> 21:01.730
And another one, you see.

21:03.110 --> 21:05.750
This is a typical longitudinal wave.

21:08.840 --> 21:16.040
These kind of waves are characterized, characterized by the fact that the perturbation moves.

21:17.090 --> 21:26.780
Along the same direction of propagations, the typical example of longitudinal waves are, for example,

21:26.780 --> 21:30.650
sound waves or more generally pressure waves.

21:31.680 --> 21:38.910
They do not have polarization, but sound waves, for example, are just pressure compression and decompression

21:38.910 --> 21:47.400
compression, decompression wave wave like in the air and they are of this current era.

21:50.620 --> 22:01.570
They move, they perturb the medium with a wave pressure along the direction of propagation so we can

22:01.570 --> 22:09.460
have two possible kind of waves, the transverse waves and longitudinal waves, transverse waves with

22:09.460 --> 22:18.220
the polarization we will have to do to deal with mainly mainly with transverse waves, because electromagnetic

22:18.220 --> 22:19.980
waves are transverse waves.

22:20.170 --> 22:29.570
So I but just for completeness, I gave you also some impressions about the longitudinal waves.

22:30.820 --> 22:36.820
So let us come to the point of this lecture of the body radiation here.

22:37.240 --> 22:43.270
What is really important to understand is a concept of the standing wave, standing waves and nothing

22:43.270 --> 22:46.760
else, then also an interference phenomena.

22:46.910 --> 22:47.710
Yeah, they.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.500
Can exist because of an interference phenomenon.

22:52.210 --> 22:59.050
Let us see how one can illustrate this with a slinky again, take one part here.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.000
Keep it fixed.

23:00.010 --> 23:04.140
I try to keep it fixed as much as I can.

23:05.060 --> 23:14.930
It's not easy to remain perfectly still to fixate on a point in the air here, but then I give OK,

23:14.960 --> 23:16.730
here I give this.

23:18.470 --> 23:20.600
Kick and you have.

23:21.850 --> 23:33.010
The usual transverse wave, but if I continue, yes, you see already we have a standing wave, but

23:33.010 --> 23:40.710
I wanted to get the first mode, so I must decrease the frequency with one mode.

23:41.110 --> 23:44.440
It's not easy to find exactly.

23:45.490 --> 23:48.070
The right frequency here.

23:48.090 --> 23:50.700
Here you have it, you have it now.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.020
Yes, this is the first standing.

23:54.150 --> 23:56.610
Mode for standing wave mode.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.220
Just a peek going up and down.

24:00.930 --> 24:04.900
If I increase the frequency, let me see.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.070
So first it becomes messy, it becomes quite messy.

24:10.230 --> 24:12.840
You must insist a bit.

24:12.840 --> 24:16.770
And then it's stable, like, no, no, this is already the third mode.

24:17.280 --> 24:21.230
And then so here we have, uh.

24:21.270 --> 24:22.850
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.300
The second mode.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.390
Two peaks and valleys.

24:27.930 --> 24:28.940
What happens here.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.500
Is that the.

24:33.170 --> 24:36.020
Perturbation and goes back and forth.

24:38.670 --> 24:47.280
Interferes with the other coming perturbation first a bit and the waves that comes back that is reflected

24:47.280 --> 24:52.610
at this site interferes with the wave that is coming from this side.

24:53.280 --> 24:58.260
And that's if you find the right frequency, you will get a standing wave.

24:58.650 --> 25:02.220
If the frequency is not correct, then it becomes messy.

25:02.250 --> 25:07.440
So now let me see if I get also this is the third mode.

25:08.760 --> 25:20.190
So this was the second mode, OK, I would say this is the third mode, one, two, three peaks and

25:20.460 --> 25:25.540
valleys, the polarization here is somewhat diagonal.

25:25.560 --> 25:34.500
I don't know if you see the in the video, but OK, so let me see if I get also the fourth mode.

25:37.590 --> 25:39.900
Yes, but it is a bit messy.

25:41.370 --> 25:45.590
So you see, you need for higher frequencies to get higher modes.

25:45.870 --> 25:52.020
You need a very stable input in amplitude and frequency, especially in frequency, I think.

25:53.490 --> 25:58.620
But you see, this is a nice way to illustrate the nature of waves.

25:58.890 --> 26:04.070
And we will find this more over and over again.

26:04.980 --> 26:13.350
What is really important now at this point is the concept of wave as a sign or cosine curve.

26:14.250 --> 26:15.750
It has an amplitude.

26:16.410 --> 26:24.750
It has a wave length lambda, it has a frequency, it can have a polarisation if it is transverse waves.

26:24.750 --> 26:33.150
And in our case, we will meet them again as electromagnetic waves and the notion of the standing wave

26:33.150 --> 26:41.520
because see what is a standing wave, it is nothing else as an another interference phenomena, because

26:41.520 --> 26:49.370
what happens is that the ingoing wave interferes with the reflected wave.

26:49.620 --> 27:00.030
Yeah, it's nothing else is an interference phenomena on well, in another physical set, one wave goes

27:00.030 --> 27:03.150
in, one wave goes out, they interfere.

27:03.150 --> 27:08.610
And when they construct when when they interfere constructively, then we have a standing wave.

27:08.880 --> 27:12.540
But to do this must have a precise frequency.

27:12.900 --> 27:16.110
Some frequencies work, some others do not.

27:16.650 --> 27:20.430
And when they work, you have the standing wave standing.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.790
Moat's the first, second and higher modes.

27:24.480 --> 27:31.590
And that's what is of paramount importance to understand generally all these concepts and notions,

27:31.590 --> 27:35.330
because you will have to deal with this with this again.

27:35.820 --> 27:42.600
Remember, I can already tell you in advance atoms and nothing else as.

27:44.190 --> 27:51.570
Standing probability waves, if you don't understand what this means now, we will deal with this later.

27:55.960 --> 28:04.210
Having a better idea now of what standing waves are, it is not too difficult to see that even if we

28:04.210 --> 28:12.760
take into account only a discrete number of possible modes in the cavity, still an infinite number

28:12.760 --> 28:15.760
of such modes can fit between the walls.

28:16.900 --> 28:25.570
In this figure and simulation, only the first six modes are shown, but in principle there is no upper

28:25.570 --> 28:25.990
limit.

28:26.830 --> 28:32.450
The mode no end can become virtually as large as we wish.

28:34.030 --> 28:42.820
If we approach an infinite infinitely more wavelength that is an infinitely high frequency, we can

28:42.820 --> 28:46.960
in principle accommodate an infinite, infinite number of modes.

28:49.370 --> 28:55.640
Therefore, the problem with this model is that in classical mechanics, there is no reason to assume

28:55.640 --> 29:02.180
that one electromagnetic mode should be considered more privileged than the others.

29:03.560 --> 29:11.810
This means that if we wait long enough, that is we wait wait until the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium.

29:13.100 --> 29:23.180
The energy will be exchanged and distributed among all the modes equally until they will finally attain

29:23.180 --> 29:25.530
the same average energy.

29:26.330 --> 29:33.230
There is no reason to believe that one mode should oscillate with more energy than the other.

29:34.640 --> 29:44.090
That means with more amplitude, the cavities, energy content should be distributed equally all over

29:44.930 --> 29:45.890
all the modes.

29:47.090 --> 29:51.260
This is what stage the classical equi partition theorem.

29:52.970 --> 30:02.150
These modes interact also with the particles of the wall of the enclosure or with those within its volume.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.330
The particles making up.

30:06.360 --> 30:15.060
The container can be seen as many little springs which oscillate with a different frequency, so-called

30:15.420 --> 30:21.330
harmonic oscillators in which absorb and remit the most energy.

30:22.370 --> 30:23.240
Continuously.

30:24.590 --> 30:33.020
In fact, it is through the repeated absorption and emission front and back to the molds that this energy

30:33.020 --> 30:43.340
exchange among the molds itself can occur, then it seems reasonable to assume that this equilibrium

30:43.340 --> 30:51.890
mean energy of the modes depends from the amount of the body's thermal energy and which in turn is determined

30:51.980 --> 30:53.250
by its temperature.

30:54.980 --> 31:00.030
In this picture, each mode can in principle oscillate within any conceivable energy.

31:00.620 --> 31:06.740
There is no upper or lower bound, and there is no reason to believe that any value in between could

31:06.740 --> 31:08.290
be considered to be forbidden.

31:10.210 --> 31:17.920
Therefore, as tiny, this average oscillation energy might be if the cavity is supposed to contain

31:17.920 --> 31:24.070
an infinite number of modes, since there is no upper limit to the frequency and mode can acquire.

31:25.010 --> 31:32.420
Each with the same small but non-zero energy, then we are forced to conclude that then the committee

31:32.420 --> 31:35.750
as a whole contains an infinite energy.

31:37.830 --> 31:45.630
So clearly, something must have gone wrong here, but even though this results seemed immediately implausible,

31:46.590 --> 31:49.680
nobody knew for sure how to tackle with it.

31:51.030 --> 31:57.360
As long as Max Planck didn't find the way out to this dilemma, the best model of the time for the black

31:57.360 --> 32:05.570
body radiation was that drive by a lot, really, and jeans in nineteen hundred and which is known as

32:05.760 --> 32:12.810
Ryley Jeans Law, it clearly displays what is called the ultraviolet catastrophe.

32:13.770 --> 32:21.610
The energy density of the radiation of a black body, a temperature t diverges at high frequencies.

32:22.650 --> 32:24.630
It was called ultraviolet.

32:24.630 --> 32:32.160
Since the ultraviolet light makes part of the upper frequency spectrum of light and where the energy

32:32.160 --> 32:43.950
and the frequency tends to diverge, this depressing state of affairs lasted until nine until nine 05

32:44.070 --> 32:46.720
when Max Planck came to rescue.

32:48.000 --> 32:57.210
We will see in the next lecture how he could avoid catastrophes and so to speak, reestablish law and

32:57.210 --> 32:58.830
order in physics.
