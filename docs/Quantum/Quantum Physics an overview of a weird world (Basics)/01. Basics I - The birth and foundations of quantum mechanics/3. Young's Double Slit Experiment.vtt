00:00.780 --> 00:09.360
Now, let us see how this concept of wave interference can be applied to the special case of the double

00:09.360 --> 00:10.290
slit experiment.

00:11.340 --> 00:15.300
This is very important because this is something we will consider frequently.

00:16.380 --> 00:24.630
Double slit experiment is almost ubiquitous in the discussion of quantum physics, quantum mechanics,

00:24.630 --> 00:25.530
quantum phenomena.

00:27.700 --> 00:35.020
Here we start with a brief introduction, please consider that this is one of the few lectures that

00:35.440 --> 00:43.180
indulge a bit into a mathematical description because it is necessary to state clearly what happens

00:43.180 --> 00:46.750
with the interference phenomena of waves.

00:47.300 --> 00:54.670
And if you are no longer acquainted with them, midscale trigonometric functions, exponents and square

00:54.670 --> 01:03.910
roots, please refer to the appendix video where these simple concepts are elucidated and applied to

01:03.910 --> 01:06.040
the description of waves.

01:07.420 --> 01:16.360
So what you see here is just a historical sketch of young man made by Young who depicted the interference

01:16.360 --> 01:25.150
phenomenon of light with these two little slits A and B, which diffract an incoming wavefront, and

01:25.150 --> 01:33.520
from which then two circular wavefront emerge and interfere on a screen according to their faces.

01:34.090 --> 01:37.660
In these positions, level C, D, E and F.

01:39.780 --> 01:47.310
But let us see in more detail and through a bit more technical description what really happens here.

01:50.270 --> 01:57.530
The experimental set up of young stubbles, little experiment is that of a wavefront which comes from

01:57.530 --> 02:06.890
the left side here in this picture and is directed at two small slits like shown here in general, such

02:06.890 --> 02:12.260
a wavefront could be a water or light wave or a sound wavefront, etc.

02:12.440 --> 02:20.210
Interference phenomena are a common characteristic of any kind of waves, not only of electromagnetic

02:20.210 --> 02:20.720
waves.

02:22.920 --> 02:31.710
Ideally, one should use a highly monochromatic source of light like that of a laser in order to obtain

02:31.710 --> 02:42.090
a single wavelength front, which makes also the interior interference fringes more clear and more clearly

02:42.090 --> 02:42.540
visible.

02:43.350 --> 02:46.910
Of course, this was still not feasible at the time of Young.

02:47.340 --> 02:49.140
He just used a candle.

02:49.560 --> 02:57.300
And with optical filters, it is possible nevertheless to obtain interference injuries, even if they

02:57.300 --> 03:02.340
appear in several colors in the bits smeared on on on the screen.

03:04.230 --> 03:11.970
The slits are small, small slits means that these have a size which is about that of the wavelength

03:11.970 --> 03:13.560
of the incoming wave.

03:15.400 --> 03:22.290
Because it's the incoming wave would have a much larger wave length than the size of the slits.

03:23.200 --> 03:34.120
It would simply bounce back or is absorbed by the walls as if there would be no slits or pinholes at

03:34.120 --> 03:34.380
all.

03:35.980 --> 03:43.570
If on the other side, the wavelength of the incoming wave would be much smaller than the slits, then

03:43.570 --> 03:50.650
it would go simply through experience without experiencing almost no diffraction.

03:52.140 --> 04:02.460
But if the wave length of the wave is comparable with as little size, then we will observe a situation

04:02.460 --> 04:03.870
like that shown here.

04:06.240 --> 04:15.900
After the Blitz Aperture and because of the distraction of the transverse plane, wavefront, two outgoing

04:16.200 --> 04:18.870
concentric wave fronts form.

04:19.800 --> 04:25.710
In a three dimensional volume, this would be a pair of spherical wavefront.

04:27.730 --> 04:34.060
Diffraction is characteristic of every wave phenomena, and of course, whenever a wave encounters an

04:34.060 --> 04:42.760
obstacle of a size comparable to its wavelength, you may have experienced this also in your daily life.

04:43.120 --> 04:51.280
If you look at a source of light from the edges of an object, from a taspinar angle, for example,

04:51.670 --> 05:01.000
or through a tiny pinhole, you will see how the contour, the linear lineaments of the figure of the

05:01.000 --> 05:05.950
object, uh, get a bit distorted and smeared.

05:06.940 --> 05:15.430
Every time light passes by an edge or a little aperture of comparable size of its wavelength, it gets

05:15.430 --> 05:16.150
refracted.

05:16.510 --> 05:19.450
That is deflected and deformed.

05:22.770 --> 05:33.630
Notice also how the two outcoming waves have an intensity which has an angular dependence, more intense

05:33.630 --> 05:36.360
heat on than seen from the sides.

05:37.920 --> 05:44.610
These travel forward in the in the direction of the screen where they will interfere.

05:46.930 --> 05:54.880
Now, the phase difference between the two waves, that one coming from one slit and the other from

05:54.880 --> 06:03.280
the other slit is determined by the length difference of the two lines traced from the two slits as

06:03.280 --> 06:06.940
one and s to eat meat at point B.

06:09.500 --> 06:18.920
To the students who do not know what the phrase difference between two waves is and means, I recommend

06:18.920 --> 06:21.530
again the appendix.

06:25.150 --> 06:33.280
In fact, it is the difference in the path that the two waves experienced in reaching the screen at

06:33.280 --> 06:37.920
that point, which is responsible for the interference phenomenon.

06:39.610 --> 06:49.030
This will form the characteristic interference fringes along the detection screen that is along the

06:49.030 --> 06:51.490
vertical axis direction.

06:53.350 --> 07:00.340
It is this phase difference which varies along the detection screen, which determines if we will have

07:00.340 --> 07:08.500
constructive or destructive interference or something in between, the bright bands are, of course,

07:08.710 --> 07:16.270
the places where we have constructive interference, whereas the darker lines represent the destructive

07:16.270 --> 07:16.690
ones.

07:18.220 --> 07:28.090
Over all the interference pattern depends on the wavelength of the light, the Slits purchases, their

07:28.090 --> 07:36.550
separation and the distance between the slits and the screen, so there are more parameters that play.

07:37.930 --> 07:41.410
Together to form a final image on the screen.

07:42.380 --> 07:50.690
Notice that the interference, of course, everywhere, not just on the screen, the screen serves only

07:50.960 --> 07:54.800
the purpose to detect it and make it visible just there.

07:55.550 --> 08:04.310
But waves overlap, overlap some or subtract each other everywhere as shown in the picture here.

08:06.650 --> 08:15.350
So now let us put this into a bit more rigorous mathematical setting in the case of the double's, let

08:16.010 --> 08:24.650
the two light beams emerging from the respective slits can be described by the two waves, say one of

08:24.650 --> 08:30.050
X, MSRA of X, again, the temporal.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.430
Dimension is ignored here.

08:34.990 --> 08:42.920
The angular distribution of the light signal on the detection screen is given by some angle data.

08:43.420 --> 08:52.960
Yeah, that is the angle between a horizontal line centered between the two slits and that connecting

08:52.960 --> 08:55.920
some point up on the detection screen.

08:57.830 --> 09:01.160
We assume the two slits as one and as two.

09:02.620 --> 09:11.830
I had the same aperture and shape and therefore the two emerging ways have also the same angular intensity.

09:12.670 --> 09:16.270
Again, the intensity depends on the angle.

09:17.710 --> 09:26.680
However, the two waves will reach the detection screen in P along to path, having different length

09:27.010 --> 09:28.300
L1 and L2.

09:29.470 --> 09:39.130
This is because the distance L1 travelled by the waves, one from S1 to P will in general be different

09:39.400 --> 09:40.330
than the distance.

09:40.330 --> 09:46.840
L2 travelled by wave cyto from S2 to the same point p.

09:50.390 --> 09:58.760
Therefore, even though the two waves have exactly the same wavelength lambda and exactly the same amplitude,

09:59.420 --> 10:09.500
let's call it side zero, they nevertheless reach an observer in point B along along two different path.

10:10.760 --> 10:20.270
With phase five, one and two, that since they have to travel along two different routes path, they

10:20.300 --> 10:27.590
will have a relative phase, the relative phase difference that the fee is just given by the models

10:27.590 --> 10:37.160
of five to minus five one, the different the phase difference between the two waves and will be determined

10:37.880 --> 10:43.200
by the absolute length difference of the two pairs, respectively.

10:43.220 --> 10:50.960
The delta will equal the absolute value L2 minus L1 and which.

10:52.590 --> 10:56.670
Ultimately depends on the position of point pee on the screen.

10:57.580 --> 11:06.910
Along the vertical axis or equivalently, equivalently by the detection angle teta.

11:08.700 --> 11:16.200
This is a major point that has to be considered accurately and that will we will encounter repeatedly.

11:19.180 --> 11:29.830
Now, if one calculates the complex squared modules again, go to the appendix because we know that

11:30.280 --> 11:41.560
every wave can be represented by a complex valued function in X and T, he only X.

11:42.850 --> 11:46.900
And so one X is a complex valued function.

11:47.260 --> 11:55.660
Two is also a complex value function, which depends from X, which means from the position along the

11:56.680 --> 12:01.440
to path L1 and having length L1 and L2.

12:02.290 --> 12:10.900
And these are just so to speak, complex values, seen sinus and cosiness functions that oscillate.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.300
Up and down accordingly to the position X.

12:18.040 --> 12:26.200
So if one calculates the complex squared modulus and we know that the complex squared modulus of a wave

12:26.200 --> 12:32.470
gives us the intensity, which is what we, after all, need to know, because what we want to measure

12:32.470 --> 12:39.910
on the screen is the intensity of that we see with our eyes or with a photographic plate or with a camera

12:40.180 --> 12:42.180
or whatever that is.

12:42.390 --> 12:49.990
Finally, what we want to have if we one calculate the complex squared models, that is the overall

12:49.990 --> 12:57.460
intensity appearing on the screen and taking into account the face difference between the two interfering

12:57.730 --> 13:03.790
waves in P independence of the detection angle.

13:03.790 --> 13:08.770
Theta one gets the following following result.

13:09.400 --> 13:14.740
The proof is a bit cumbersome and would go beyond the scope of this introductory approach.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.320
And we want illustrated here.

13:16.330 --> 13:28.330
But just so that you get an idea, intuitive idea, how these two how these these two waves interfere.

13:29.320 --> 13:39.160
Constructability or destructively, it is appropriate, I believe, to show at least the final result

13:40.660 --> 13:49.180
and what you get here is the squared modulus of Siwan X plus two X is equal again.

13:49.300 --> 13:59.050
So one X squared, model squared plus side two X squared plus plus another.

14:00.520 --> 14:08.500
Term, which is two times the real part of the complex conjugate of, say, one.

14:10.210 --> 14:20.650
Was a star symbol of X times two X, so it is not necessary to know everything what this means if you

14:20.650 --> 14:31.360
don't see this, it is I illustrate this for those who have a little bit of a notion of complex functions

14:31.360 --> 14:33.160
and complex calculus.

14:33.700 --> 14:43.320
But the final result is that this term here, try one X squared is just the intensity of the first beam.

14:44.200 --> 14:54.400
Let's call them beams beam one has intensity I one of which is given by just the squared modulus of

14:54.880 --> 15:06.310
X, the squared model two to X is the intensity of beam two, which is the other two intensities that

15:06.310 --> 15:08.140
come out from the two slits.

15:08.890 --> 15:18.340
But what we see at the screen at point B is the resultant interference signal on the screen, which

15:18.350 --> 15:21.490
with three turns the.

15:23.070 --> 15:34.660
I already mentioned to wave squared models plus twice the real part of the product of the two wavefunction,

15:34.660 --> 15:37.780
one conjugate wavefunction times the other one.

15:39.730 --> 15:47.500
So there is also the third term, the third term that emerges emerges from the calculation and which

15:47.500 --> 15:54.940
makes it clear how in general the intensity at point at a point in space resulting from the two interfering

15:54.940 --> 15:59.920
waves is not the sum of their intensities.

16:02.140 --> 16:10.990
This because they're the third extra term, is the so-called interference term, according to the values

16:11.650 --> 16:19.120
Delta fee of the relative Festschrift shift between the two beams, one has constructive interference,

16:19.270 --> 16:28.510
interference term is positive when that fee is an even multiple of two PI and adds up or.

16:29.650 --> 16:40.990
Destructive interference when Delta V is an odd multiple of P and subtracts, it is this interference

16:40.990 --> 16:52.510
term which modulates the intensity of the signal according to the observation angle along the screen.

16:54.370 --> 17:03.340
Or in other words, if we move a detector that measures the intensity along the extraction, at each

17:03.340 --> 17:15.490
point the intensity will oscillate up and down according to the peaks and valleys of the cosine Delta

17:15.500 --> 17:16.330
function.

17:17.750 --> 17:26.810
Which adds when positive or subtracts when negative and amount of two times the square root of I one

17:26.810 --> 17:32.270
times I too from the term I won plus I to.

17:34.770 --> 17:44.340
Taking a photograph, say, with the CCD camera, each pixel will display a fixed signal intensity twice

17:44.340 --> 17:52.800
the intensity of the single slits light pin plus or minus an intensity which changes along the vertical

17:52.800 --> 17:53.400
axis.

17:55.370 --> 18:05.020
Maximum intensity and minimum intensity appeared due to constructive or destructive interference, respectively.

18:05.480 --> 18:14.480
But the wide interference fringes on a black background or displaying it in a more somewhat more technical

18:14.480 --> 18:14.830
manner.

18:15.020 --> 18:23.240
It's mathematical reconstruction is usually depicted with a curve like the red function graph here.

18:24.150 --> 18:33.180
Whereas and this is an important point to remember, the intensity of the fringes decreases with the

18:33.180 --> 18:44.130
anger because of the anger dependents of the two outcoming beams, as we have described previously.

18:45.670 --> 18:53.520
So finally, the important point that we have to understand is why and how we can discern between a

18:53.530 --> 19:01.990
wave and a particle, a wave will always show up with interferons phenomenon in the double slit.

19:01.990 --> 19:08.950
Experiment is the most classical device, the classical and the most classical experiment, which makes

19:08.950 --> 19:09.520
this clear.

19:11.200 --> 19:18.100
Newton firmly believed that light is made of particles made up of particles.

19:18.340 --> 19:27.970
But later, when in 18 or one young made this double slit experiment as many other experimental facts

19:27.970 --> 19:35.050
showing interference phenomena suggest also at all these experiments showed.

19:36.360 --> 19:47.040
Unequivocally, that light behaves like a wave if light is made of particles, interference could not

19:47.040 --> 19:47.800
become visible.

19:48.150 --> 19:55.530
We can speak of interference of waves, but there is no meaning in saying that to point like particles

19:55.680 --> 20:04.130
interfere with each other from the standpoint of classical physics and that of our everyday experience,

20:04.140 --> 20:12.060
it would make even less sense to speak of a single particle traversing, going through both slits at

20:12.060 --> 20:18.170
the same time and then even interfering with itself like a wave.

20:19.390 --> 20:21.220
Once it hits a screen.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.720
Or does it have a meaning?

20:25.660 --> 20:27.770
This is the great question.

20:28.720 --> 20:36.490
We shall see how subtotal nature can be and to conclude this lecture.

20:36.520 --> 20:44.860
Finally, here are some examples, some other images which illustrate the interference phenomena.

20:45.940 --> 20:50.950
This one is an image of a double slit experiment made with laser light.

20:51.940 --> 20:58.300
Since the laser light is highly monochromatic and can be much more intense than the light of a candle,

20:58.990 --> 21:01.520
you see much more fringes appear.

21:03.070 --> 21:10.270
You can see here do not appear just two or three, four inches, but a dozen on each side.

21:12.640 --> 21:17.860
This instead is an analogous situation, then the double slit experiment.

21:17.860 --> 21:26.160
And that shows how the interference between two point sources looks like these are just two WAF points

21:26.160 --> 21:33.490
sources on a plane, as you can see also here, naturally, the maxima and minima into interference

21:33.490 --> 21:34.480
fringes appear.

21:36.810 --> 21:44.910
This image reminds us that exactly the same phenomenon can be observed in waterways, there is in principle

21:44.910 --> 21:51.360
no logical reason to believe that the double slit experiment can be performed with water waves or sound

21:51.360 --> 21:56.240
waves or any form of other waves like pressure waves also and so on.

21:57.150 --> 22:06.780
Interference, therefore, must be understood at as a universal property of whatever kind of waves.

22:09.310 --> 22:16.120
And in these in this in this last image, you can see how also bees seem to know something about it

22:16.120 --> 22:21.280
and enjoy playing around with similar experiments as we like to do it.

22:23.140 --> 22:30.220
So the takeaway message is that interference is a universal and very common phenomenon of the physical

22:30.220 --> 22:33.610
reality and that we must have clearly in mind.

22:34.570 --> 22:41.920
It is something which is not characteristic of quantum physics only, but at any rate, it will turn

22:41.920 --> 22:49.570
out to be something which describes the quantum world very well, as we will see next.
