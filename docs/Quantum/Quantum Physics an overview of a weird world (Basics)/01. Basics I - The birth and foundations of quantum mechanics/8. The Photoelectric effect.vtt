00:00.840 --> 00:08.220
We have seen so far how the theory of black body radiation fits the experimental evidence only if we

00:08.220 --> 00:16.620
assume that energy is absorbed and emitted always, so to speak, pacard wise in the form of discrete

00:16.770 --> 00:17.340
quanta.

00:18.450 --> 00:23.370
However, BlackBerry radiation was only the first hint of this kind.

00:24.120 --> 00:31.080
A lot of other experiments showed how nature seemed to exchange energy energy only in the form of quanta.

00:31.890 --> 00:39.630
These experiments told us the same story in different ways from different perspectives, but always

00:39.780 --> 00:46.380
with the same underlying plot, according to which energy and therefore also light can be conceived

00:46.380 --> 00:48.570
of as made of particles.

00:49.630 --> 00:56.680
One of the most important pieces of evidence of this type came from the so-called photoelectric effect

00:57.160 --> 01:02.890
and from which Einstein coined the term photon for the light particle.

01:03.880 --> 01:10.630
The photoelectric effect was already discovered in 1887 by the German physicist Heinrich Schatz.

01:11.380 --> 01:19.180
He observed that sending light of sufficient high frequency onto a metal plate leads to the emission

01:19.420 --> 01:27.160
of charged particles from the metal surface and which turned out to be electrons.

01:28.260 --> 01:36.030
Heads, however, was not able to explain the true meaning and physical implications of this phenomenon,

01:37.260 --> 01:46.470
the theoretical understanding and explanation came later in 1945 and which was developed by Albert Einstein

01:47.490 --> 01:49.620
to understand what it is all about.

01:49.650 --> 01:56.940
We will outline only a brief sketch here without going too much into the technical details, just to

01:56.940 --> 01:58.710
give you an intuitive idea.

02:00.570 --> 02:06.480
Now, imagine having a metal plate and you shine onto it a beam of light.

02:07.830 --> 02:17.940
Suppose the light is in the far infrared spectrum, which means that any source of electromagnetic energy

02:18.600 --> 02:24.270
emits light at the wavelength corresponding to the infrared spectrum.

02:24.270 --> 02:32.550
Infrared, infrared wavelength so much below the red color, light, visible light, which means we

02:32.550 --> 02:38.970
are using only a relatively low frequency or if you prefer, long wavelength electromagnetic wave.

02:40.620 --> 02:47.100
This low frequency light beam would produce no effect on the metal plate, except, of course, that

02:47.100 --> 02:49.260
it heats up or eventually melts it.

02:49.860 --> 02:52.500
But no emission of charged particles.

02:52.710 --> 03:00.960
The electrons will be observed at all as long as the light is under a specific threshold frequency or

03:01.170 --> 03:04.650
if you again, if you prefer, or above a specific wavelength.

03:06.240 --> 03:14.730
This, of course, independently from the intensity, the intensity of the beam, it will not happen

03:14.730 --> 03:17.030
even for strong light intensities.

03:17.730 --> 03:23.130
If you shine with strong and strong light intensities, nothing will happen.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.210
Nevertheless.

03:25.620 --> 03:33.840
If, however, the light goes beyond the frequency of the light, goes beyond a specific threshold frequency

03:34.170 --> 03:43.620
or below a threshold wavelength, then suddenly a flux of electrons from the surface of the metal can

03:43.620 --> 03:44.370
be detected.

03:45.510 --> 03:51.690
And again, this, of course, independently from the intensity of the beam, and this happens also

03:51.690 --> 03:53.760
for low intensity light.

03:55.620 --> 04:04.290
What this shows is that light waves can extract the electrons, the so-called photon electrons from

04:04.290 --> 04:10.830
the metal surface, which is made of an atomic metal lattice.

04:11.940 --> 04:19.470
The fact that this occurs only for certain metal plates made it clear that the photoelectric effect

04:19.470 --> 04:26.250
does not extract electrons directly from the atoms for electrons.

04:26.250 --> 04:34.680
Are those electrons which were trapped inside the atomic lattice and are nevertheless free to move inside

04:34.680 --> 04:37.680
it when an electric field is applied?

04:38.550 --> 04:46.890
It is this property that, by the way, makes certain metals good conductors and allows to transport

04:46.890 --> 04:49.830
electric energy through metal cables.

04:49.830 --> 04:51.660
As everyone knows.

04:53.130 --> 05:01.200
Therefore, this extraction process from the metal that this occurs only when the electrons acquire

05:01.200 --> 05:05.310
a specific energy at a minimum extraction frequency.

05:06.370 --> 05:06.820
No.

05:06.820 --> 05:14.410
Zero, which, of course, is related to a minimum extraction wavelength in which we can describe as

05:14.410 --> 05:24.550
Lumb, that zero equals C over zero, where of course, the C is the speed of light and not zero is

05:24.550 --> 05:26.860
this minimum extraction frequency.

05:29.050 --> 05:36.220
This graph, for example, illustrates the state of affairs, if we trace on the horizontal axis the

05:36.220 --> 05:44.290
frequency of the incident incident light and on the vertical direction and the vertical axis, the kinetic

05:44.290 --> 05:53.710
energy ekin of the outgoing four to electron, then one can see how only if the wavelength becomes small

05:53.710 --> 06:00.550
enough or equivalently the frequency becomes high enough that is larger than zero.

06:01.330 --> 06:11.410
Then will electrons begin to be kicked out from the surface and appear with some kinetic energy larger

06:11.410 --> 06:12.400
than zero?

06:14.150 --> 06:22.970
In case you don't know what the difference is between kinetic energy, potential energy, impulse momentum,

06:22.970 --> 06:24.630
angular momentum and so on.

06:24.660 --> 06:29.740
Please take a look to the brief lecture in the appendix.

06:30.500 --> 06:37.870
If you have a clear understanding of the difference between kinetic and energy and momentum of a particle,

06:38.090 --> 06:40.130
then of course you don't need it.

06:43.000 --> 06:50.710
Which implies that part of the light energy that is incident on the metal surface must be employed to

06:50.920 --> 06:55.030
extract the electrons first from the metal lattice.

06:56.850 --> 07:04.830
This minimum energy is called the work function, and it with a Greek letter, letter fee, every metal

07:04.830 --> 07:12.540
has a different work function, which means that every metal has a different threshold frequency, but

07:12.540 --> 07:16.170
the effect remains qualitatively, qualitatively the same.

07:16.740 --> 07:24.540
Once the electrons are extracted from the plate, then what remains of the energy of what was once light

07:25.200 --> 07:28.950
goes into the electrons kinetic energy.

07:31.700 --> 07:40.250
So in general, it turns out that the observed electrons kinetic energy must be the difference between

07:40.490 --> 07:49.580
the energy contained in the incident light photons, which we know now have photon energy of eight times

07:49.580 --> 07:57.260
new age, the Planck's constant nor the frequency of the wavelength associated to the photon and the

07:57.260 --> 08:02.120
amount of work fee necessary to extract them from the metal.

08:02.870 --> 08:09.980
In brief, you get a simple formula like this one where you have the kinetic energy equals age time,

08:09.980 --> 08:11.580
snow minus fee.

08:13.700 --> 08:19.640
Note that this is not a theoretical speculation, but an exclusively experimental fact.

08:20.480 --> 08:27.860
For every light frequency with which one shines the metal plate, a specific kinetic energy of the electrons

08:27.860 --> 08:28.510
is measured.

08:29.060 --> 08:33.860
If we are above a specific frequency threshold.

08:35.150 --> 08:42.560
Doing this for a large number of wavelengths or frequencies, why not Thain's is strictly linear dependency

08:42.560 --> 08:50.480
between the lights incident energy and the emerging electrons kinetic energy out from the metal surface

08:51.140 --> 08:59.270
like that shown here in the graph, while the threshold wavelength lambda zero of threshold frequency,

08:59.270 --> 09:03.530
not zero, are determined by the type of metal one uses.

09:05.100 --> 09:12.600
However, and this is an important point, the slope of the of the straight line of the graph, a linear

09:12.600 --> 09:18.780
graph, is always the same for every metal and kind of substance one uses.

09:19.710 --> 09:28.500
It is it the slope is a universal constant and namely that the Planck's constant, this is, in fact,

09:28.500 --> 09:30.720
how Planck's constant could be measured.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.470
Precisely.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.270
What this determines is substantially the change in the work function only determines determines a parallel

09:42.270 --> 09:47.340
transport of this straight line upwards or downwards.

09:48.180 --> 09:50.700
But the slope of this.

09:52.090 --> 10:00.810
Graff never changes because this is a universal constant that is given by nature.

10:02.500 --> 10:10.960
So the point is also that increasing the intensity, which results in increasing the number of incidents

10:10.960 --> 10:15.580
photons does not change the result either.

10:16.090 --> 10:24.270
An increase of the light intensity, that is the photons flux does not at all alter the above graph.

10:24.850 --> 10:29.170
It only changes the number of observed for two electrons.

10:30.250 --> 10:35.650
If above threshold, of course, still, but not their kinetic energy.

10:37.050 --> 10:45.000
The intensity does not play any role in the determination of the kinetic energy of the outgoing electrons,

10:46.320 --> 10:54.030
a higher light intensity does not lead so therefore to a more energetic, ejected electrons, it only

10:54.030 --> 10:55.350
determines its number.

10:56.970 --> 11:04.080
This is a point this is somewhat unusual for a classical understanding, where we imagine light as a

11:04.080 --> 11:11.340
wave, because the question at this point is why does light extract electrons from the metal only above

11:11.340 --> 11:19.800
a threshold frequency, say, in the spectral domain of ultraviolet light or X-rays, but not below

11:19.800 --> 11:20.090
it?

11:20.550 --> 11:29.490
So, for example, in the visible human visible light domain, why can we not bombard, so to speak,

11:29.700 --> 11:34.420
the metal surface with a higher intensity light of the same wavelength?

11:34.860 --> 11:43.860
Just imagine many waves with large amplitude amplitude that overlap together to obtain the same result,

11:44.370 --> 11:50.760
namely that of extracting the electrons from the metal surface, which means from the metal lattice.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.990
How should we interpret this result?

11:55.930 --> 12:02.830
Well, the generally accepted explanation, according to Einstein, is that as we have seen with the

12:03.100 --> 12:10.780
black body radiation, we must conceive of light as made up of single particles, that is, photons

12:10.780 --> 12:18.160
that carry a specific amount of energy and impulse and which are absorbed by the electrons one by one.

12:19.630 --> 12:26.980
But this happens only if a single photon has sufficient energy to extract the electrons from its crystal

12:27.190 --> 12:28.690
lattice and the metal.

12:30.090 --> 12:37.090
The electron will not absorb two or more photons to overcome the energy barrier of the lattice it is

12:37.110 --> 12:46.050
trapped in, it must wait for the photon that has all the necessary, necessary energy that will allow

12:46.050 --> 12:48.480
it to be removed from the metal lattice.

12:49.320 --> 12:57.450
And since it absorbs only one photon at a time, all of the electrons emerging from the plate will never

12:57.450 --> 13:04.290
show up with energies of more than that of the single absorbed photon, even though a larger number

13:04.290 --> 13:11.250
of photons, which means higher intensity of the light, can extract a larger number of electrons.

13:13.960 --> 13:23.440
It was in 1985 that Einstein published his theory of the photoelectric effect alongside his historical

13:23.440 --> 13:25.630
paper on special relativity.

13:26.840 --> 13:35.390
For the explanation of the photoelectric effect and his so-called corpuscular little particle interpretation

13:35.390 --> 13:39.140
of light, Einstein received his Nobel Prize.

13:39.890 --> 13:49.550
So it was not for the theory of relativity, as it is sometimes wrongly believed, but it was the explanation

13:49.550 --> 13:59.690
of the electric effect and which introduced the notion of the light particle, the so-called photon.
