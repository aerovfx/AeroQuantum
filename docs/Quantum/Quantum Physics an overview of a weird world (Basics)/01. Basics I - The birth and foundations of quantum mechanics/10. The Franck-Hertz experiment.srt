00:00.120 --> 00:07.860
Another nice and clear cut piece of experimental evidence that atoms must have discrete energy levels

00:08.370 --> 00:13.590
came only a year later after Bors proposal of his atomic model.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.250
It was the so-called truncates experiment.

00:18.780 --> 00:26.670
Gustaaf Lutwyche Katz was the nephew of Childhood of Hats, the German physicist we already mentioned

00:26.670 --> 00:34.980
as the discovery of the photoelectric effect, while high likelihood of health, among other things,

00:34.980 --> 00:38.340
prove the existence of electromagnetic waves.

00:39.210 --> 00:48.000
Gustaaf Ludwick Earth and James Frank, where we were awarded the 1925 Nobel Prize in physics for what

00:48.000 --> 00:57.150
the Nobel Committee expressed as their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon

00:57.150 --> 00:57.840
an atom.

00:59.430 --> 01:03.780
And they did so using the experiment we are going to describe now.

01:05.480 --> 01:12.440
The experimental setup is this one, it consists of Macary gas atoms.

01:13.390 --> 01:22.630
Inside a low pressure bulb, an electric cathode that is something like the heated filament of a light

01:22.630 --> 01:25.630
bulb and which emits electrons.

01:27.080 --> 01:35.120
Therefore, this part of the device emits not only light, but also negatively charged particles and

01:35.120 --> 01:42.740
electric field is applied between the electron emitting cathode and a positively poled creating.

01:44.040 --> 01:50.880
With a battery or some other electric source which builds up an electric potential.

01:53.210 --> 02:00.710
Due to their negative charge, this difference in the electric potential field leads to the electrons

02:00.740 --> 02:08.780
acceleration and conveys to them some kinetic energy, as you might recall, from school charges with

02:08.780 --> 02:16.400
the same polarity repel each other, whereas those with opposite opposite polarity attracted to each

02:16.400 --> 02:25.970
other when the electrons reached reached the grating, most of them will fly through because the mesh

02:26.180 --> 02:30.590
of the grating is kept sufficiently wide to allow for that.

02:32.730 --> 02:38.340
This first part functioned as a little electronic accelerator.

02:40.710 --> 02:47.790
Then between the grating and a collecting plate on the right side, another field is applied.

02:48.540 --> 02:56.550
But in this second part of their journey of the electrons flying through the gas they will experience

02:56.550 --> 03:05.100
and inversely polarized electric field, since after passing the grating, they will be repelled because

03:05.100 --> 03:10.710
they will begin to feel, so to speak, that negatively charged collecting plate.

03:12.910 --> 03:20.380
This means that by using an amp meter and ampere meter, a device which measures measures the electric

03:20.380 --> 03:28.720
current, that is the flux of electrons between the grating and the collecting plate, it is possible

03:28.720 --> 03:38.080
to measure also the changes of the electrons energy and establish how their energy is affected by the

03:38.080 --> 03:43.480
atoms while flying through the gas and the second part of the bulb.

03:46.240 --> 03:56.140
Frank and had the idea was that while flying through the gas of atoms, several electrons must sooner

03:56.140 --> 04:04.960
or later hit one or more atoms, mercury atoms, and be scattered either elastically or in elastically.

04:06.370 --> 04:14.920
Elastic scattering means that when an object hit a target, they change course, but maintain the same

04:14.920 --> 04:17.410
kinetic energy while.

04:18.350 --> 04:27.300
I inelastic scattering implies that they lose part or all their kinetic energy in the collision process.

04:28.400 --> 04:36.470
It follows that there must be a measurable difference between the energy of the injected electrons reaching

04:36.470 --> 04:37.190
the grating.

04:38.870 --> 04:47.630
And that of those which flew through the gas, hitting the collecting plate and which is then made clear

04:47.630 --> 04:53.270
to the observer by the measurement of the current between the grating and the collecting plate.

04:54.970 --> 05:02.320
It is this energy gap which tells us something about the energy absorbed by the atoms in the gas.

05:04.720 --> 05:13.990
Therefore, if atoms absorb energy only in the form of Quanta, this implies that while we slowly increase

05:13.990 --> 05:22.270
the kinetic energy of the injected electric electrons, we should be able to observe when, when and

05:22.270 --> 05:23.500
to what degree.

05:24.590 --> 05:30.320
The electrons are absorbed by the gas of mercury atoms.

05:33.540 --> 05:39.300
This is indeed what happens as can and can be observed in the following graph.

05:41.310 --> 05:49.200
Why they injected electrons, kinetic energy is increased steadily by applying an electric potential

05:49.200 --> 05:59.640
from zero to about 15 volts between the cathode and the grating, the horizontal axis here, the current

05:59.640 --> 06:03.090
of the electrons measured at the collecting plate.

06:04.160 --> 06:13.340
Given on the vertical axis increases accordingly, but not in a linear fashion, we observed that the

06:13.340 --> 06:20.210
electrons do not have a finer kinetic energy which increases proportionally to the electrons input energy

06:21.080 --> 06:29.070
according to what one would expect for an elastic scattering between classical objects.

06:29.510 --> 06:32.150
Think, for example, billiard balls.

06:33.590 --> 06:41.990
What we see instead is that at first between zero and four volts, the relation between the input and

06:41.990 --> 06:50.900
output on energy is more or less approximately linear, which means that the electrons are scattered

06:50.900 --> 06:53.510
through the gas elastically.

06:53.870 --> 06:57.410
They do not lose considerable kinetic energy.

06:59.130 --> 07:10.500
But at about four point 4.5 volts, the first bump appears between four and five volts, the output

07:10.500 --> 07:18.090
energy of the electrons decreases steadily despite their increasing initial energy.

07:19.780 --> 07:28.630
This signals and inelastic scattering some of the energy the electrons had initially must have been

07:28.630 --> 07:39.100
suddenly absorbed in the collision with the head with mercury atoms, but this does not happen before

07:39.100 --> 07:49.930
a certain kinetic energy energy threshold of the electrons hitting the mercury atoms at about five point

07:49.930 --> 07:50.860
eight volts.

07:52.090 --> 07:59.260
Almost all of the kinetic energy is lost and goes into the internal excitation of the atoms.

08:00.550 --> 08:07.840
There is, however, a remaining minimum energy gap which is shown in the figure with the vertical red

08:07.840 --> 08:08.770
arrow here.

08:10.790 --> 08:18.740
The difference between the first pick and the first minimum is the maximum amount of kinetic energy

08:18.770 --> 08:29.300
the atoms are able to absorb from the electrons and therefore furnishes us the first excited energy

08:29.300 --> 08:31.190
level of the mercury atom.

08:33.460 --> 08:41.350
Then after about six to nine volts, the energy begins to increase again, meaning that the atoms absorb

08:41.350 --> 08:49.510
only the that aforementioned discrete amount of the electrons energy, but not more than that.

08:50.930 --> 08:55.100
The remaining energy goes again into elastics shattering.

08:57.170 --> 09:05.540
As you can see, all this repeats regularly at about nine to 10 balls and about 14 balls.

09:07.950 --> 09:16.170
The existence of these bumps, so to speak, at different input energies, means that atoms must have

09:16.170 --> 09:19.080
several different but discrete energy levels.

09:20.730 --> 09:29.730
Frankfurt's experiment was the first direct experimental proof, confirming Blank's idea that matter

09:29.730 --> 09:34.410
absorbs energy in discrete quanta.

09:35.670 --> 09:42.780
Moreover, this also validated the discrete spectral lines of light spectra, as did Borse idea to represent

09:42.930 --> 09:50.940
the atoms in the form of a model which resembles a tiny solar system that is with electrons moving only

09:50.940 --> 09:58.710
on specific orbits with their respective quantum numbers, which represent different but precise and

09:58.710 --> 10:00.230
discrete energy levels.
