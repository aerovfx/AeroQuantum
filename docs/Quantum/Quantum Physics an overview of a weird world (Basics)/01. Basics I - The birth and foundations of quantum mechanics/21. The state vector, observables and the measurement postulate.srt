00:00.900 --> 00:06.330
Let us go through a brief introduction to some formal aspects of quantum mechanics.

00:07.350 --> 00:13.650
We will keep it a non rigorous introduction in contrast to a complete course on quantum mechanics,

00:14.580 --> 00:21.930
but it is nevertheless necessary to digest some simple but very important formalism and symbolism,

00:22.290 --> 00:25.980
since it will continue to emerge frequently here and there.

00:26.400 --> 00:33.840
And it is that kind of representation, mathematical representation that you will encounter throughout

00:34.020 --> 00:36.180
all textbooks on quantum mechanics.

00:37.580 --> 00:41.270
So let us turn our attention back to the concept of the wavefunction.

00:42.040 --> 00:50.060
We consider it to be continuous for the position and space of a particle and its value, the density

00:50.060 --> 00:58.340
probability or the integrated probability function of the particle in space, which gives us the total

00:58.340 --> 01:01.500
probability that an event occurs.

01:02.150 --> 01:06.950
This does not change abruptly from one point to another.

01:07.430 --> 01:14.090
And for the case of the position of a particle along an x axis in space, it is a continuous function.

01:14.390 --> 01:22.720
That is the way function of X of X, X opposite X is a continuous function in X.

01:22.730 --> 01:31.460
Technically speaking, the system has an infinitely many degrees of freedom, one size, also infinite,

01:31.640 --> 01:33.530
many degrees of freedom.

01:34.970 --> 01:43.400
We saw, however, that there can be other behaviors of quantum systems, for example, that the energy

01:43.400 --> 01:47.670
state of atoms is quantized, for instance.

01:47.720 --> 01:57.140
Recall the optical spectral lines of hydrogen or the fun experiment where we saw that the atoms have

01:57.470 --> 02:00.460
discrete energy levels here.

02:00.470 --> 02:11.840
The wave function can no longer describe the behavior of continuous energy output, but the energy is

02:11.840 --> 02:12.350
insteps.

02:12.350 --> 02:18.560
So also the wavefunction, uh, can no longer be a continuous function, but must be represented by

02:18.560 --> 02:21.410
a set of discrete possible states of the system.

02:22.670 --> 02:28.760
As for instance, we have already seen the case of the hydrogen spectrum in these cases, we must ride

02:28.760 --> 02:36.200
the wave function, the wavefunction PSI not as a continuous function in space, but as a set of signal

02:36.200 --> 02:45.680
states, E1, E2, E3 and so on until n the end energy state, which can be represented, which can

02:45.680 --> 02:56.300
represent the discrete energy states, capital letters, letters, E1, E2, E3 and so on, until N

02:56.990 --> 03:03.020
or the dynamic of variables like spin or angular momentum, as we shall see later.

03:04.240 --> 03:10.540
In the language of quantum mechanics, each of these discrete states of a quantum system are called

03:10.540 --> 03:19.420
Igen states from the German Igen, which means self igan states are those quantum states where repeated

03:19.420 --> 03:25.090
measurements of the system under consideration will always lead to the same result.

03:26.470 --> 03:35.170
So, for example, if a particle is in a specific igan state energy and states, this means that I measure

03:35.620 --> 03:39.250
its energy and always I get all this the same energy.

03:39.290 --> 03:47.710
So then we can say that particle is or that atom or whatever that quantum system is in that ion state,

03:48.340 --> 03:55.150
which distinguish itself from other sort of states that we will see later, because we will see that

03:55.360 --> 04:01.570
how also quantum systems can be also in a superposition of state.

04:03.000 --> 04:10.980
So, for example, the energy of a quantum system is the dynamic variable, the observable quantity

04:10.980 --> 04:17.190
that can be measured and which can have several discrete igan states E1, E2, E3, but not something

04:17.190 --> 04:19.980
in between in quantum mechanics.

04:19.980 --> 04:27.830
These Afghan states are defined on a Hilbert space without going too much into mathematical details.

04:27.850 --> 04:35.730
It's suffice to say that the Hilbert space is an abstract vector space that is an extension of the real

04:36.330 --> 04:43.920
Euclidean space to a multidimensional space of complex numbers and complex vectors.

04:44.190 --> 04:52.380
So if the Hilbert space has a finite dimension, it is the state space of a quantum system with a finite

04:52.380 --> 04:54.090
number of island states.

04:54.390 --> 05:01.850
Otherwise, it is infinite, as infinite is then the number of degrees of freedom.

05:03.060 --> 05:10.170
Another important difference between the space as we conceive it in school geometry is that the elements

05:10.170 --> 05:15.000
of the Hilbert space are no longer points and coordinates, but functions.

05:15.910 --> 05:19.650
The wavefunction being the primary object to act on.

05:20.800 --> 05:29.650
So instead of points, we have wavefunction, the Eigen states, E1, E2, E3 and so on form the Igen

05:29.920 --> 05:38.530
basis, Igen basis of the Hilbert space and the over, all possible states of a quantum system are represented

05:38.530 --> 05:47.680
by a vector defined on this basis called the state eigenvector or just eigenvector or simply the state

05:47.680 --> 05:48.220
vector.

05:48.730 --> 05:56.740
As in the figure, you can see a simple case for a system with three possible agnostic states.

05:57.460 --> 06:04.350
So you see here, for example, the case of a system with three possible igan states.

06:04.810 --> 06:10.090
Therefore, we can depicted make a graph, a picture in a three dimensional space.

06:10.210 --> 06:19.270
If it would have more igan states, more possible states, this would be possible to make a graph of

06:19.270 --> 06:23.680
it because then we would have a multidimensional object.

06:24.220 --> 06:32.620
However, until one, two or three dimensional, it is still in our human understanding how to represent

06:32.620 --> 06:33.550
this with a graph.

06:33.700 --> 06:38.620
And it resembles in some sense, the Cartesian coordinate system.

06:39.680 --> 06:48.580
However, instead of the X, Y and Z axis, we have the axis corresponding to the three possible states

06:48.970 --> 06:50.770
or eigenvectors.

06:51.940 --> 07:02.350
Whereas the length of each eigenvector take for instance, each one is given by a complex coefficient

07:02.650 --> 07:08.410
C one the same also for the other two actors, C two and three, C three.

07:08.470 --> 07:15.130
These are complex numbers which express how long this vector is.

07:16.410 --> 07:18.030
Whereas here the.

07:19.410 --> 07:30.450
Total vector, so to speak, which is a state vector in quantum mechanics, is the linear combination

07:30.630 --> 07:33.990
of all the AGN eigenvectors.

07:35.440 --> 07:42.490
So we see that this is given by the red vector and we see that the state vector of of the whole of the

07:42.490 --> 07:52.100
system over all the possible states is given by BPCI equals one one plus three to two plus three easily.

07:53.170 --> 07:59.640
We will now quickly describe also this formalism with the strange brackets.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.900
I will come to this next.

08:02.440 --> 08:09.550
But what is important that you understand, at least intuitively, this principle of the state vector

08:09.730 --> 08:18.910
and how this is a linear combination of all the possible eigenvectors in what we call a Hilbert space,

08:18.910 --> 08:28.360
in this case a three dimensional, but normally it is much bigger Hilbert space eventually also an infinite

08:28.360 --> 08:29.680
dimensional space.

08:31.570 --> 08:37.420
So as we see, let's recapitulate, because this is also an important point, the information with what

08:37.420 --> 08:45.210
probability each of the Igan states will be observed after a measurement is carried by the complex coefficients

08:45.210 --> 08:47.070
see one, two, three, and so on.

08:47.890 --> 08:51.120
This means also that the bond rule still holds.

08:51.250 --> 09:01.240
You remember model squared, the probability capital letter P associated to the is igan state e i is

09:01.240 --> 09:04.750
the squared models of the E complex coefficients.

09:05.020 --> 09:05.570
C.

09:05.570 --> 09:05.860
E.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.620
So as we read it here.

09:09.590 --> 09:16.370
P of e i equal, c I times C I complex you.

09:17.600 --> 09:25.730
Is equal, the model of square of S.I for I equal one, two and so on, depending from the dimension

09:25.730 --> 09:31.300
of the Hilbert or if you prefer, the number of possible Igen states or to quantum system.

09:32.960 --> 09:37.580
So let us see something about this notation, their notation.

09:39.220 --> 09:44.460
Of this sort here and with which is pronounced cat by.

09:45.410 --> 09:52.580
Is common notation for vectors in quantum theory, state vectors can be written according to the Dirac

09:52.580 --> 09:53.350
notation.

09:54.590 --> 09:59.570
Paul Dirac was a British physicist who made several contributions in quantum theory.

10:00.230 --> 10:06.860
We already saw how he used to write the kind of integrals we encountered when we discussed the Bourne

10:06.860 --> 10:15.830
Rule as brackets as and you pronounce this here, Brassai capsid sort of.

10:17.610 --> 10:27.530
Each bracket bracket is a product more precisely, one should say the inner product of a better but

10:27.780 --> 10:30.750
bracket a AROW vector, which.

10:32.050 --> 10:40.420
Elements are the complex conjugate of a and a cat vector, B, a column vector.

10:41.800 --> 10:49.180
As you can see, this was not like lacking a bit of weird lexical fantasy, which, however, turned

10:49.180 --> 10:50.910
out to be extremely useful.

10:51.640 --> 10:59.040
For example, the general bracket brought a cat B is given by this formula.

10:59.050 --> 11:04.270
Here you see a cat B is equal.

11:05.910 --> 11:14.720
The complex conjugate vector of a bra A and which is written horizontally as a one complex Connealy

11:14.910 --> 11:24.970
times a too complex concept and so on, so on, until a complex conflict times the vector, that cat

11:24.990 --> 11:33.120
B, which is a vector written vertically and in each element without a complex conjugation.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.930
So be one P to be two and so on until the end.

11:38.040 --> 11:45.900
And which Phanor is written as a one complex conjugate of one times B one plus complex conjugate of

11:45.900 --> 11:48.540
A two times B two and so on.

11:49.830 --> 11:56.870
This is just an algebraic method to define our writing.

11:56.880 --> 12:07.270
So you see the right expression of this formula can be synthesized in this very compact form, rather

12:07.620 --> 12:08.790
a cat B.

12:10.550 --> 12:17.290
This means also that with Dirac's notation, a lot of calculations are made formally simpler.

12:18.700 --> 12:22.370
For example, if you take this one here.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.140
The bra.

12:25.140 --> 12:38.980
Of the East Asian state, Brax, a etai equal to a vector, which is zero everywhere except at the E

12:39.000 --> 12:47.220
coefficient, at the E coefficient, and you put there the complex conjugate coefficient corresponding

12:47.490 --> 12:51.650
to the length of the E eigenvector.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.490
So you have zero zero zero.

12:53.490 --> 13:00.890
And at the IS position C, a complex conjugate Ochiai start and the others also zero.

13:01.290 --> 13:14.250
And then you write as a CI equal, you want to see three and Sien and then the probability to find that

13:14.250 --> 13:25.110
is agan state can be written also in that bracket notation as follows the probability p of e i that

13:25.120 --> 13:30.770
is I can state to measure that is I can say it is given by the model, the square of Brax.

13:31.910 --> 13:42.200
If I get PSI, which is equal, the model square of C, I think, and according to the little formula

13:42.200 --> 13:50.000
and calculation we have done here above, it is just a symbolic formalism introduced by Dirac and later

13:50.390 --> 13:57.200
developed further by others, such as the mathematician John Funnymen, with which one represents the

13:57.220 --> 14:02.390
probability to observe a system with a number of possible discrete states.

14:03.580 --> 14:12.210
It is customary also to state that it is the model square of the projection of the state vector BPCI

14:12.580 --> 14:23.140
onto the igan basis spanned by its eigenvectors, one can interpret the dashed lines in the graph as

14:23.140 --> 14:24.310
projections here.

14:24.310 --> 14:29.110
This lines are the projection of what the measurement does.

14:29.290 --> 14:40.240
When you measure a quantum system, you project its state or state vector on to one of its IDN basis.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.400
It is a measurement act.

14:42.430 --> 14:48.040
The project projects the state vector onto one of its possible Iten basis vectors.

14:49.240 --> 14:57.340
This is analogous to the way function, collapse or state production we saw in the case of a continuous

14:57.340 --> 14:59.460
wave function there.

14:59.470 --> 15:05.710
Also, the act of measurement collapses the way function, describing the particle position in a continuous

15:05.710 --> 15:10.600
space on one of the infinitely possible states after all.

15:10.840 --> 15:15.070
Also, the position of a particle is a state here.

15:15.340 --> 15:23.980
The same happens the projection of the state vector onto one of its aying basis is, mathematically

15:23.980 --> 15:31.060
speaking, what we do in reality, doing a measurement in the laboratory with a measurement device.

15:31.060 --> 15:40.510
We bring the quantum system from a quantum not still not defined quantum state, and then make a measurement

15:40.510 --> 15:47.920
and only one of these possible states happens to come into being so to speak.

15:49.600 --> 15:57.880
Moreover, once the quantum system has been placed into one of the island states in quantum mechanics

15:57.880 --> 16:02.350
jargon, one says it has been prepared into a specific state.

16:02.980 --> 16:09.910
And if it does not interact with the environment, then every subsequent measurement will always deliver

16:10.300 --> 16:11.140
the same result.

16:11.860 --> 16:14.440
Therefore, the system being in the state.

16:15.750 --> 16:16.170
Cat.

16:17.470 --> 16:18.520
E i.

16:20.770 --> 16:30.220
In fact, this description of quantum measurement derives directly from experimental observation and

16:30.220 --> 16:38.260
was first formalized by von Neumann, also known as the four nomen projection postulate or.

16:39.340 --> 16:45.460
More recently, in modern quantum theory, you simply call it the measurement measurement postulate

16:45.610 --> 16:57.310
of quantum mechanics, and in its modern version, it tells us the following, that for each measurement

16:57.310 --> 17:04.450
of an observable, the probability to find it in one of its possible igan states is given by the formula

17:04.450 --> 17:10.790
that we have discussed previously that we see more of the square of the complex coefficients.

17:11.920 --> 17:21.130
Secondly, after the measurement, the system instantly collapses from state to state etai system to

17:21.520 --> 17:23.320
one of the vectors.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.830
And this is the projection.

17:27.070 --> 17:33.720
It projects the projects, the state vector from side, from step side to one of the island states.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.860
Ay ay ay ay ay ay.

17:37.680 --> 17:43.960
Thirdly, from that moment on, any new measurement will always show the system to be still in the same

17:44.230 --> 17:44.610
state.

17:45.470 --> 17:53.350
This is an important fact, which means that say, for example, we have a particle which is in some

17:53.890 --> 17:54.700
superposition.

17:54.700 --> 17:58.410
For example, we don't know what kind of state it is.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.720
It can be whatever kind of system.

18:01.930 --> 18:08.650
But once the measurement is made on this particles, they say it's spin up.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.450
We get spin up in the measurement.

18:10.760 --> 18:15.070
Then if we repeat the measurement, we will always see spin up again.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.290
The same, obviously, with spin down.

18:18.430 --> 18:24.670
That's something we have already seen with Tangela Experiments where we saw that once we measure the

18:24.670 --> 18:33.760
spin of a particle, then cascading the stars and galaxies devices on the same axis that's important

18:33.760 --> 18:39.100
on the same axis, then you will always see it again in the same state.

18:40.220 --> 18:49.090
So in short, a very important postulate of quantum mechanics and why this puzzle has always been employed

18:49.750 --> 18:53.550
with success as a powerful predictive tool in quantum mechanics.

18:54.250 --> 19:02.980
Later on, we will see how it leads to some still unsolved issues summarized by the so-called measurement

19:02.980 --> 19:03.460
problem.

19:04.090 --> 19:13.420
You go from the measurement to measurement problem and which is also famously represented by the Schrodinger's

19:13.420 --> 19:15.700
cat experiment and paradox.

19:18.080 --> 19:27.350
Again, with the sum of all the models squared, complex coefficients, each representing the probability

19:27.350 --> 19:30.530
of the ice, can states to be measured.

19:32.380 --> 19:41.620
These must obviously sum up to Surtain certainty that you must get one number one, which tells us that

19:42.010 --> 19:45.100
this is 100 percent probability that this.

19:46.370 --> 19:54.200
One of these must come out because there are no other left or to put it another way, the sum of the

19:54.200 --> 19:59.550
probabilities of all possible evil even must give unity.

19:59.570 --> 19:59.830
No.

20:01.210 --> 20:10.240
Not how the sum of all the probabilities adding up to unity is represented in Dirac's notation neatly

20:10.600 --> 20:17.110
as this expression here, which is rare Keat of side.

20:18.180 --> 20:28.830
Which is the sum of all the complex coefficients squared and which must finally give the number one.

20:31.590 --> 20:41.490
Also, keep in mind that eigenvectors are always depicted and considered as perpendicular vectors to

20:41.490 --> 20:50.790
each other that is orthogonal or also normal vectors orthogonal means generically that they are perpendicular

20:50.970 --> 20:54.290
and also normal means that they are perpendicular vectors.

20:54.300 --> 20:57.490
But with unit length one, they have a length one.

20:58.140 --> 21:06.420
But in any case, eigenvectors are orthogonal and they represent mutually exclusive measurement outcomes

21:06.780 --> 21:09.840
such as spin up and spin down.

21:10.750 --> 21:16.650
You, of course, the quantum state can be in a superposition before the measurement, but once you

21:16.650 --> 21:21.780
have made the measurement, you will only see or spin up or spin down.

21:21.960 --> 21:26.220
You cannot see in the real world spin up and spin down at the same time.

21:26.580 --> 21:33.600
And this is translated geometrically in the fact that the eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other.

21:35.370 --> 21:37.410
Also, remember that if.

21:38.580 --> 21:49.150
To eigenvectors, Eisenstaedt vectors are let's let them simply cat and cat B are orthogonal, then

21:49.380 --> 21:55.130
they are sculler product Brahe A Cat B is always equal zero.

21:55.500 --> 22:02.910
So if you want to check if two vectors are perpendicular to each other, you just make the sculler product

22:02.910 --> 22:03.270
of them.

22:03.270 --> 22:13.160
And if it is zero, then this is a geometrical demonstration, proof that they are indeed perpendicular.

22:13.500 --> 22:21.390
And this means physically in our measurement environment, in the laboratory that we are talking about,

22:21.390 --> 22:23.910
two mutually exclusive.

22:24.920 --> 22:26.510
Outcomes, measurement outcomes.
