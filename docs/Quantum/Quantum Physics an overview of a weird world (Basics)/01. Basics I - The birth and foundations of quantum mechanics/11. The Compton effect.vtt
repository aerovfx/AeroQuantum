00:00.840 --> 00:08.760
Not too many years later, after the Frank Act's experiment, other types of phenomena confirmed energy

00:08.760 --> 00:10.230
quantization in nature.

00:11.220 --> 00:20.910
One of these in 1923 was the so-called quantum scattering documented by the American physicist Arthur

00:20.910 --> 00:21.600
Compton.

00:23.190 --> 00:30.630
Compton also started from the assumption that electromagnetic waves could be considered as a flux of

00:30.630 --> 00:31.740
light particles.

00:31.740 --> 00:32.850
That is, photons.

00:34.390 --> 00:42.280
In fact, if this were true, it would then be possible to calculate precisely the scattering process

00:42.280 --> 00:50.650
between a single photon and, say, an electron, just like it is possible to describe the elastics

00:50.650 --> 00:59.380
collision between two billiard balls using the simple laws of energy and momentum conservation of classical

00:59.380 --> 00:59.920
physics.

01:01.310 --> 01:09.110
Now, by using these conservation laws, Compton wrote down a concise and useful formula which relates

01:09.110 --> 01:18.110
the wavelength lamda of an incoming high energy gamma ray photon that is a photon with a wavelength

01:18.110 --> 01:25.880
sufficiently small to be comparable to the size of an electron before the scattering with the electron

01:25.880 --> 01:34.550
itself and the wavelength, the prime of the scattered photon, according to a scattering angle theta.

01:36.020 --> 01:43.580
The wavelength to the prime of the shattered photon must be larger than that of the incoming one, since

01:43.580 --> 01:53.270
it loses some of its energy because the higher the energy of a photon, the smaller its wavelength will

01:53.270 --> 01:53.570
be.

01:54.920 --> 02:02.960
Or vice versa, the lower the energy of a photon, the larger the wavelength will be higher.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.940
The color of the incoming photon is depicted in blue.

02:05.990 --> 02:13.640
While that of the outgoing one is red for obviously for illustration purposes only, of course, gamma

02:13.640 --> 02:17.950
rays are well beyond of any visible light to the human eye.

02:20.430 --> 02:24.540
In fact, remember that the energy of a photon is given by Planck's formula.

02:25.660 --> 02:34.870
Equal age times, new with new, the frequency and of course, age, the Planck's constant, as you

02:34.880 --> 02:44.980
certainly already know by now, the wave lambda, often electromagnetic wave is given instead by lambda

02:44.980 --> 02:45.600
equal.

02:45.760 --> 02:56.080
See over know with see the speed of light at is about 300000 kilometers per second.

02:56.680 --> 02:59.830
The speed of light in volume, at least in media.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.210
In a medium it is.

03:02.650 --> 03:12.090
Less but smaller, but in vacuum, this is a constant, universal constant of the speed of light.

03:12.730 --> 03:22.780
So the wavelength we associate with the photon must be inversely proportional to its energy as e equal

03:22.780 --> 03:27.790
again, eight times no equal, eight times C over lambda.

03:30.150 --> 03:37.500
At this point, you might become somewhat confused by the fact that we are talking about light particles,

03:37.740 --> 03:45.660
which are supposed to be point like objects and yet continue to treat them and even depict them graphically

03:46.020 --> 03:48.540
as waves having a specific wavelength.

03:50.120 --> 03:59.180
Again, as we have already seen with the photoelectric effect effect, nature seems to play with this

03:59.180 --> 03:59.840
ambiguity.

04:00.410 --> 04:08.270
It seems as if light or any electromagnetic energy traveling through space can be thought of as a wave.

04:08.540 --> 04:13.810
And since matter absorbs and emits it in form of discrete energy quanta.

04:14.000 --> 04:20.790
Also, as a particle, we shall clarify the deeper meaning of this duality in the coming sections.

04:21.620 --> 04:28.560
For now, please accept this fact on face, so to speak, and follow the line of reasoning and the phenomenon

04:28.560 --> 04:37.640
of phenomenology of these historical experiments, which became the foundation of all that will be explained

04:37.640 --> 04:38.150
later.

04:40.530 --> 04:48.300
So putting all this together in 1923, Compton was able to predict, therefore, a very strict relation

04:48.540 --> 04:56.850
between the difference in wavelength, between the incoming and scattered photon independence of its

04:56.850 --> 05:06.690
scattering angle theta, which is the wavelength shift Delta Lambda, that radiation suffers when it

05:06.690 --> 05:08.430
is scattered by matter.

05:09.960 --> 05:13.230
Compton's formula was Delta Lambda equal.

05:13.260 --> 05:24.330
That lambda prime means minus lambda equal some constant lambda zero times one minus the cosine function

05:24.330 --> 05:33.570
of the scattering angle theta where this lambda zero here is given by H over the mass of the electron

05:33.900 --> 05:35.820
times the speed of light C..

05:37.200 --> 05:43.500
And this is a constant which is called the Compton Wavelength.

05:43.500 --> 05:52.320
Lambda Zero is called the Compton Wavelength, which for the electron is about two point four times

05:52.710 --> 05:54.340
minus 12 meters.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.700
So a very, very small, very small length.

06:01.550 --> 06:03.380
Notice that if.

06:04.620 --> 06:15.120
T to our data is zero, we have no difference, which means that the photon goes straight through without

06:15.120 --> 06:17.160
scattering and frequency change.

06:18.570 --> 06:21.940
That is here because I interviewed zero.

06:21.990 --> 06:29.400
It is one one minus one zero zero times that zero is again zero, so dealt there is zero.

06:29.400 --> 06:35.400
And which makes it clear that by going straight along, it does not.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.850
There is no collision, so to speak.

06:39.390 --> 06:48.360
Whereas for Teater, equal 180 degrees, which means for Becs, scattering the wavelength increases

06:48.510 --> 06:55.140
by twice the quantum wavelength where twice, two times LAMDA zero because.

06:56.150 --> 07:05.720
The cosine of 180 degrees is minus one, one minus minus one is two, then we have two times that zero,

07:06.020 --> 07:15.350
which is the difference in wavelength that a photon suffers if it is scattered by an electron.

07:17.850 --> 07:23.460
The possibility to know precisely this kind of relations, the relation between the input and output

07:23.460 --> 07:32.670
wavelengths or also therefore energies of the particles and their respective scattering angle was verified

07:32.670 --> 07:33.600
experimentally.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.890
And it turned out that Compton's predictions are followed.

07:37.890 --> 07:38.700
Precisely.

07:39.930 --> 07:48.210
This was a nice historic example of the triumph of theoretical physics confirmed by later by experimental

07:48.210 --> 07:54.570
verification and how in the history of science, sometimes the first comes them the math, the mathematics,

07:54.570 --> 08:01.920
the calculation, and then comes the verification in the lab, even though sometimes it goes the other

08:01.920 --> 08:02.790
way around.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.090
Compton's scattering is also an atomic setting process.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.920
You can see here an illustration of this process.

08:14.870 --> 08:23.810
This suggests that also the also the explanation of how photons can ionized ionized atoms to ionize

08:23.810 --> 08:33.020
an atom means that a photon extracts an electron from an atoms outer orbit shell around its nucleus.

08:33.860 --> 08:41.690
A light particle with sufficient sufficiently high frequency or therefore energy and momentum can be

08:41.690 --> 08:51.050
absorbed by one of the electrons so that the electrons acquires a certain amount of kinetic energy and

08:51.050 --> 08:59.780
can eventually be removed by overcoming the atomic forces potential that kept it bound to the nucleus.

09:03.080 --> 09:09.740
A gamma ray photon, however, can be so penetrating that it can ionize if the inner electron shells

09:09.740 --> 09:17.420
and partially or completely transfer its electrons electromagnetic energy to the electron, which acquires

09:17.420 --> 09:25.220
the gamma rays, momentum and kinetic energy, and which for this reason is also also called photo electron,

09:25.520 --> 09:28.160
like in the photoelectric effect.

09:30.140 --> 09:36.370
Notice, however, that the photoelectric effect and the CONTEN effect are two very different physical

09:36.440 --> 09:37.540
physical processes.

09:38.240 --> 09:44.840
The former extracts the electrons from a crystal metal, atomic metal, a metal lattice.

09:45.420 --> 09:52.880
The letter effect that Compton is a deep scattering process process that can kick out, so to speak,

09:53.300 --> 09:58.630
the electrons which are contained in the inner shells of the atoms itself.

10:01.250 --> 10:07.600
A single high energy photon can also be scattered by several atoms and will lose collision after collision,

10:07.610 --> 10:16.610
its energy, a high energy small wavelength or if you prefer, high frequency photon can be become via

10:16.610 --> 10:22.120
multiple strings, whereby it loses a bit of its energy in each collision.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.960
A low energy, large wavelength, low frequency photon.

10:29.360 --> 10:37.580
This is an effect that plays an important role in the center of the sun, in the sanskar, which has

10:37.580 --> 10:41.120
a temperature of about 60 million of degrees.

10:41.900 --> 10:44.150
There is a huge amount of gamma radiation.

10:44.900 --> 10:50.900
It takes, however, several million of years of scattering processes until the photons produced inside

10:50.900 --> 11:01.820
the sun reach the surface where they will have lost most of their energy, being sought to be downgraded

11:01.820 --> 11:06.470
to the photons that we know as visible light.

11:07.880 --> 11:15.710
In fact, the light we observe nowadays coming from the sun's surface was once an intense radiation

11:16.010 --> 11:21.380
form of gamma photon in the interior of the sun.

11:23.360 --> 11:30.500
What makes Compton's scattering so important and interesting also for our consideration here is that

11:30.500 --> 11:37.910
all this seems to suggest again that we can equally well consider electromagnetic waves no longer as

11:37.910 --> 11:39.080
waves at all.

11:39.710 --> 11:47.860
But think of light particles of photons like tiny billiard balls kicking around other particles.

11:49.190 --> 11:57.020
If we were to stick to the classical idea that light is made of waves, we should observe a scattering

11:57.020 --> 11:59.100
of concentric waves by the electron.

11:59.630 --> 12:03.610
Think of our weight or waterways scattered by an object.

12:04.730 --> 12:14.950
So this cannot be a we in if we conceive only of waves which are scattered by something.

12:15.180 --> 12:18.820
And again, think of scattered waterways.

12:19.310 --> 12:22.490
You don't see particles kicked around here and there.

12:22.820 --> 12:28.190
If you see an outgoing concentric, uh.

12:30.070 --> 12:38.140
Stream of waves, no contain scattering instead indicates that the application of the conservation laws

12:38.140 --> 12:45.220
of classical physics, which determines the scattering between classical particles, holds also with

12:45.220 --> 12:45.830
photons.

12:46.480 --> 12:54.790
There is therefore at this point no longer any reason to reject a particle picture in quantum mechanics

12:55.150 --> 12:57.100
instead of the wave picture.
