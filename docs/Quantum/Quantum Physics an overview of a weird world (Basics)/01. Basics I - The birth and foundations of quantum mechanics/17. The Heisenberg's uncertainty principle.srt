00:00.820 --> 00:11.020
Another famous principle that most of you may have heard of is the Heisenberg's uncertainty or determination

00:11.020 --> 00:11.660
principle.

00:12.880 --> 00:17.800
Usually it is explained with a few sentences or with wrong analogies.

00:17.800 --> 00:25.030
And people, sometimes even professional physicists, have a misleading understanding of what it is

00:25.030 --> 00:31.000
about, therefore, to get a clear picture and avoid misunderstandings.

00:31.360 --> 00:38.050
It is instructive to deepen further our understanding of the diffraction and interference phenomenon

00:38.380 --> 00:41.950
for the one, two and many of its cases.

00:44.030 --> 00:50.210
So far, we concentrated our attention on young stubbles lead case in that occasion.

00:50.240 --> 00:58.010
We saw how when a couple of slits the a transverse plane wave, it produces the typical interference

00:58.010 --> 01:03.770
pattern made of white maxima and dark M.A fringes on a detection screen.

01:05.480 --> 01:13.300
And we saw that this is equally true if we sent also only one photon at a time through the slits after

01:13.310 --> 01:20.840
sufficient number of photons have excited the single photosensitive molecules of the photographic plate

01:20.840 --> 01:22.650
or the camera sensor.

01:23.090 --> 01:26.210
Again, the interference fringes reappear.

01:27.960 --> 01:34.270
The question at this point is what happens if we use only one bullet or vice versa?

01:34.710 --> 01:37.380
What happens when we use many bullets instead?

01:39.020 --> 01:46.880
Already at about the end of the 17th century, well before the birth of quantum mechanics, the singer

01:47.120 --> 01:57.470
and endless interference phenomena were well known and extensively studied as every good textbook on

01:57.470 --> 01:59.450
electromagnetism will tell you.

01:59.630 --> 02:06.620
Also, a single bullet or a pinhole will produce an interference pattern, even though less pronounced.

02:08.060 --> 02:15.170
We mentioned how Young studied the friction at a pinhole already before experimenting, experimenting

02:15.170 --> 02:21.340
with the double slit, it is even an easy experiment that you can do by yourself.

02:21.650 --> 02:30.470
Just take a piece of paper, poke a little round hole with a pin or a needle and look towards a light

02:30.470 --> 02:31.010
source.

02:32.120 --> 02:39.850
You will observe the image of the light source surrounded by several consistent concentric colored fringes.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.250
We will see this pattern later.

02:42.260 --> 02:50.660
Also, the colors appear obviously only due to the fact that fortunately the world we live in is not

02:50.780 --> 02:51.710
monochromatic.

02:51.720 --> 02:52.970
There are many colors.

02:54.950 --> 02:58.890
More precisely, for example, here in this picture.

02:59.030 --> 03:08.600
This picture shows how a plane wave behaves when one of percha, the single bullet of size A is about

03:08.600 --> 03:12.050
five times the size of the light wavelength.

03:12.830 --> 03:16.370
That is A equals five times lambda.

03:18.020 --> 03:25.520
Due to the direction that occurs when whenever a wave encounters an object or Haslet, especially when

03:25.520 --> 03:34.880
its size is comparable to the wavelength, this causes at a fraction of the plane wavefront to a spherical

03:34.880 --> 03:40.280
or distorted wavefront, which then travels towards the detection screen.

03:42.200 --> 03:50.180
In this case, you see that even though we are dealing with only one bullet, still some weak but clearly

03:50.330 --> 03:55.280
with visible secondary minima and maxima fringes can be observed.

03:56.870 --> 04:04.250
An important and important point here to keep in mind is to avoid a common misconception, and that

04:04.250 --> 04:11.420
one reads frequently also in some popular science books, according to which only two or more states

04:11.420 --> 04:13.640
can produce interference fringes.

04:14.610 --> 04:20.880
Whereas for the single toilet, interference affects supposedly disappear.

04:21.600 --> 04:29.430
However, this is not entirely correct through it is easier to produce more pronounced interference

04:29.430 --> 04:32.610
patterns with more than one toilet or pinhole.

04:34.650 --> 04:41.880
And that for most applications, especially when the wavelength of the incident wave is much smaller

04:42.030 --> 04:43.960
than the size of the aperture.

04:44.730 --> 04:46.440
These effects can be neglected.

04:47.250 --> 04:54.540
However, strictly speaking, and this is also important for us as singers, it also produces small

04:54.540 --> 04:56.990
diffraction and interference phenomena.

04:59.110 --> 05:07.060
An elegant explanation of how interference comes into being also for a signal, it dates back to the

05:07.060 --> 05:10.810
French physicist Augustus Augustine, Israel.

05:11.950 --> 05:20.410
He borrowed an idea from Horgan's, hence the name Horgan's Fresnel principle, according to which every

05:20.410 --> 05:27.340
point on a wavefront should be considered a point source of a spherical wave itself again.

05:28.770 --> 05:38.190
Once the incoming plane wave reaches all the virtually infinite points along the aperture, every single

05:38.190 --> 05:43.890
point becomes itself again, a spherical wave point source, so to speak.

05:45.910 --> 05:49.630
All this point like sources along the A percha.

05:50.430 --> 05:57.570
And at the same time, their own spherical wavefront, which, however, when seen from the position

05:57.570 --> 06:01.890
on the screen, end up producing an interference pattern.

06:03.210 --> 06:12.030
The reason for this is not so difficult to visualize since all fronts are initiated in different locations

06:12.030 --> 06:13.270
along the aperture.

06:13.590 --> 06:21.810
They will also travel at different parts length, which implies that they have different phase shifts

06:21.810 --> 06:23.760
when they overlap on the screen.

06:25.240 --> 06:33.190
For instance, in this figure of the previous slide, we show here again, the two pairs of the two

06:33.190 --> 06:36.780
saucers from the edges are considered.

06:37.720 --> 06:45.550
And as in the case of the double slit, these two rays have a relative phase shift by an amount Delta

06:45.550 --> 06:54.640
V, and when superimposed together on the screen, they form a result, resultant intensity according

06:54.640 --> 06:56.290
to the interference laws.

06:57.490 --> 07:05.170
In this case, however, this holds not only for two ways, as in the double slit, but for an infinite

07:05.170 --> 07:06.490
number of points.

07:06.490 --> 07:16.420
Sources along the Aperture Fresnel, by making the appropriate calculations, was able to show that

07:16.420 --> 07:25.870
if one sums up all these spherical wavefront wavefront coming from the points along the upper aperture

07:26.020 --> 07:34.930
of the single slit and projects these on to all the points along the detection screen, then one obtains

07:34.930 --> 07:38.560
indeed the known diffraction and interference pattern.

07:40.750 --> 07:47.740
And if we repeat now the same experiment with as little that has a size close to the wavelength of our

07:47.740 --> 07:56.950
incoming wavefront, that is instead of using a pinhole of five times lambda, that is five times the

07:56.950 --> 08:03.270
wavelength of the incoming wavefront, but only one time the size of the.

08:03.550 --> 08:05.640
So a equal one lambda.

08:05.830 --> 08:11.850
So the size of the aperture is about the wavelength of the incoming wave.

08:12.430 --> 08:16.650
Then we see that the interpret the interference fringes disappear.

08:17.500 --> 08:25.210
As you can see in this figure here, only when the size of the slits or not of the slit of the single

08:25.210 --> 08:30.550
slit is equal to or smaller than the wavelength.

08:31.330 --> 08:34.250
Are the fringes definitely absent?

08:35.230 --> 08:42.550
This is because the slit is so small that only a single point source can form a spherical wavefront

08:42.910 --> 08:48.280
with a wavelength equal to the slit size and therefore can be.

08:49.750 --> 08:58.240
There can be no path difference and phase shift with some other source which will produce the interference

08:58.240 --> 08:58.690
pattern.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.480
However, diffraction has become very large instead.

09:04.510 --> 09:13.510
Now at this point for a equal lambda so that the photons will displace themselves on a relatively large

09:13.870 --> 09:21.130
area on the screen, according to a so-called bell shaped distribution.

09:22.320 --> 09:28.260
So the important point to keep in mind here is that the interference pattern, the interference phenomena

09:28.980 --> 09:33.620
does not arise simply due to the fact that there are one or two or many states.

09:33.630 --> 09:36.960
But it is and it is a universal phenomenon.

09:36.970 --> 09:40.990
You can have this also on at one slit.

09:41.420 --> 09:45.360
So it depends how large the slit is.

09:45.810 --> 09:55.620
And these, uh, the interference fringes disappear completely only if the aperture is about the wavelength

09:56.430 --> 09:57.840
as the size of the wavelength.

09:57.960 --> 10:03.300
Otherwise, there is still a little bit left.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.840
So it is important that you keep in mind this.

10:08.030 --> 10:14.600
Let us look also quickly at what happens if we change the number.

10:14.900 --> 10:20.690
It's a special example so we can compare three different cases.

10:22.160 --> 10:30.530
Here on the accessor that is on the horizontal line, we have the angle of position on the screen angle

10:30.530 --> 10:38.420
of incidence teeter between the centerline of the diffraction plane at a point on the detection screen

10:39.350 --> 10:41.630
while on the ordinate access.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.550
That is the vertical axis.

10:43.850 --> 10:46.220
We have the usual intensity.

10:47.270 --> 10:55.730
The parameters that determine the angle dependence of the interference pattern are, first of all,

10:55.730 --> 11:02.770
the size a of the aperture of the slit relative to the wavelength here.

11:02.780 --> 11:06.880
In this case, we have taken a equal three times lambda.

11:06.890 --> 11:12.030
So the size of the aperture is three times the size of the wavelength.

11:13.040 --> 11:23.060
Second, the spacing, the between the slits here I took three times eight and of course the number

11:23.330 --> 11:25.730
capital letters and of the slits.

11:27.280 --> 11:32.920
The intensities have been normalized in all the cases to one to to unity.

11:34.630 --> 11:42.100
So you see that for the one solid case, you see there are some weak but clearly discernible secondary

11:42.370 --> 11:48.490
blue lateral peaks that reduce almost to the diffraction envelope.

11:50.990 --> 11:57.920
For the two slits, as in the case of young double slit experiment, we obtain more pronounced Frenches

11:57.920 --> 11:59.960
traced with this red line.

11:59.960 --> 12:07.730
Here you can see how the one slit pattern envelopes the two slits pattern.

12:09.200 --> 12:16.460
And the interference figure of the signals led pattern is split into several more fringes.

12:17.930 --> 12:24.650
However, notice that it would be incorrect to say, as you might hear frequently, that when we switch

12:24.650 --> 12:30.310
from the double slit back to the single case, interference phenomena disappear.

12:31.430 --> 12:33.890
That is in general, not the case.

12:35.360 --> 12:43.220
What happens is that we return to the envelope of the single bullet, which contains many fewer fringes

12:43.550 --> 12:49.760
but still might have, and in this case it has some other interference fringes, too.

12:51.320 --> 12:57.880
Again, interference is not a phenomenon specific to the double or more slit experiment.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.370
Interference does not disappear.

13:00.380 --> 13:07.220
If one slit is covered, it just becomes weaker then with more slits, but it is still there.

13:08.990 --> 13:14.090
Finally, the green curve depicts the case of 10 bullets.

13:15.320 --> 13:21.830
This time the two slits curve turns out to be the the envelope curve of the ten slits curve.

13:23.570 --> 13:30.500
So you can observe how this is a more general trend and phenomenon which results from the interplay

13:30.500 --> 13:39.380
between diffraction and interference, in fact, the endless fringes and their spacing's arise due to

13:39.380 --> 13:43.520
this combined effect between diffraction and interference.

13:46.160 --> 13:55.370
These were only a few examples that I wanted to show you to outline how, at least intuitively, wave

13:55.370 --> 14:05.210
interference works programmers who might be interested to recreate the infinite possibilities and possible

14:05.570 --> 14:13.520
combinations of interference figures can find this general formula of intensity, of the intensity function

14:14.750 --> 14:16.640
of some use if they wish.

14:17.120 --> 14:19.080
If you wish, you can play with it.

14:19.100 --> 14:27.200
It is sometimes interesting and amusing to see the kind of pattern that result when changing the parameters.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.930
I place this formula here only for the interested student.

14:32.300 --> 14:35.750
We won't need it at all in the rest of the course.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.540
So you can also skip it if you wish.

14:39.290 --> 14:46.040
Now, we have seen in the previous lectures, especially with the friction out, the friction and interference

14:46.040 --> 14:52.370
phenomenon, determine the wave particle duality not only of light particles, that is photons, but

14:52.370 --> 15:00.110
more generally hold for all particles, also material particles that have a mass and that nevertheless

15:00.410 --> 15:07.330
behave like waves, even though we think we think of them as localized pieces of solid matter.

15:08.990 --> 15:15.380
A question we might ask at this point is what happens with the particle if we want to know precisely

15:15.380 --> 15:16.970
its whereabouts in space?

15:18.770 --> 15:26.420
For example, let us determine the precise position of a particle by letting it go through a tiny pinhole,

15:26.780 --> 15:32.730
as Isaac Newton used to do with photons and his investigations on the nature of light.

15:34.250 --> 15:41.900
If a particle goes through that single little hole on a piece of paper, say, for example, then we

15:41.900 --> 15:47.280
are authorized to say that we can determine its precise position in space.

15:47.900 --> 15:57.380
In fact, this can be done, but at the cost, because on the other hand, we know that due to the wave

15:57.380 --> 16:02.060
particle duality, we cannot forget the particle swathi aspect.

16:02.750 --> 16:11.030
So when a particle also material particle goes through this pinhole, it will also be distracted and

16:11.030 --> 16:17.810
afterwards position itself on the detector screen according to an interference interference pattern.

16:19.830 --> 16:30.990
If instead of dealing with slits, so we take a tiny round hole with a size comparable to a few multiples

16:30.990 --> 16:32.040
of the wavelength.

16:33.490 --> 16:42.520
We obtain circler interference for injuries like shown in this figure here, and this is an intrinsic

16:42.520 --> 16:46.780
and an unavoidable effect for all types of waves.

16:48.430 --> 16:57.160
If particles have to be linked to weight, to a wave, according to the debris, the very relation conceiving

16:57.160 --> 17:06.330
it as a wave packet, then we will always have the interference fringes, even with only one or oscillate,

17:06.340 --> 17:08.620
and even with only one particle.

17:09.580 --> 17:12.010
Recall the single photon experiment.

17:13.400 --> 17:20.690
In this figure, we compare the two cases where the pinhole determines the position of the particle

17:21.050 --> 17:30.500
with an aperture of a equals to lamda, which means a relatively high precision because the aperture

17:30.500 --> 17:39.230
is only two times the wavelength as the size of two times the wavelength of the incoming wave or meter

17:39.230 --> 17:49.190
wave, and the other case of a equal 20 times lambda, which means we determine with low precision the

17:49.190 --> 17:53.420
whereabouts of the particle because.

17:54.960 --> 18:03.870
The Aperture A is 20 times as large as the wavelength of the particle where, of course, lambda here

18:03.870 --> 18:11.460
the wavelength is can be that of the photon, of the electromagnetic wave, or in case of a meter wave,

18:11.950 --> 18:16.860
it must be associated to the to the liberally wavelength.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.800
Therefore, if the pinhole is small.

18:22.890 --> 18:31.320
It localizes quite well the position of the particle, it will produce a relatively broad diffraction

18:31.320 --> 18:35.600
pattern that renders the position on the screen of the photon uncertain.

18:36.780 --> 18:44.610
We can know in a relatively precise manner the where the photon or the matter particle went through

18:44.610 --> 18:50.790
the piece of paper that is inside the space constrained by the Pinhas aperture.

18:51.510 --> 19:01.250
But it will be displaced laterally on the screen anyway due to the friction and interference phenomena.

19:01.980 --> 19:05.520
And we cannot avoid this because it is a law of nature.

19:05.550 --> 19:15.300
A lot of the that governs the waves, of course, with a single particle producing a single spot on

19:15.300 --> 19:18.680
the screen, no interference figure is visible.

19:19.170 --> 19:25.980
But as we have learned with a single photon diffraction at the double slit, the probability to find

19:25.980 --> 19:34.380
this spot is in one to one correspondence with the intensity of the interference fringes produced by

19:34.380 --> 19:35.400
many particles.

19:36.910 --> 19:44.740
Moreover, and this is the important point that we have already made, recall also that we can't predict

19:44.890 --> 19:49.270
in advance where precisely this spot will appear.

19:51.310 --> 19:57.050
If instead the pinhole is large, fringes will become less pronounced.

19:57.940 --> 20:05.710
We will know where the photon will hit the screen with relatively good accuracy, the red spikes here,

20:06.940 --> 20:14.460
which means it failed, so to speak, only a tiny displacement, displacement along the screen.

20:14.860 --> 20:20.460
But by doing so, we will lose our capacity to determine where where this is.

20:20.470 --> 20:28.960
Particle exactly went through the pinhole, since this pinhole is no longer a pinhole at all, but a

20:28.960 --> 20:30.220
large hole.

20:32.270 --> 20:39.230
There is no way, never, ever, not even in principle, to obtain the precise measurement of the particle

20:39.230 --> 20:46.880
position and at the same time avoid the production of interference, fringes or at any rate, a large

20:46.890 --> 20:55.670
deflection, one will always obtain a more or less pronounced bell shaped or peaked distribution of

20:55.670 --> 21:02.960
white spots on the screen, not because we have not a sufficient precise measurement apparatus, but

21:02.960 --> 21:08.390
because this is a consequence of the intrinsic wave nature of particles.

21:09.410 --> 21:17.630
It is a universal law of nature, according to which it is hopeless to believe that we can pass a wave

21:17.930 --> 21:23.820
through as late tiny slit and not observe any interference and diffraction phenomena.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.930
It is against the nature of waves itself.

21:29.620 --> 21:37.780
So if you have followed so far, it should be easy at this point to understand the essence of Heisenberg's

21:37.780 --> 21:39.030
uncertainty principle.

21:40.780 --> 21:50.380
Werner Heisenberg was a German physicist who around the 1930s asked himself if and how there is a way

21:50.380 --> 21:53.530
to precisely determine the position of particle.

21:55.190 --> 22:02.530
This one was one of the most urgent questions to find an answer for, since, after all, in classical

22:02.540 --> 22:09.980
classical physics, everything is expressed, analyzed and described in terms of space, time, forces

22:10.100 --> 22:14.680
and particles following accordingly precise trajectories.

22:15.680 --> 22:22.310
If we are no longer able to describe the position in space of a particle, we are substantially blowing

22:22.310 --> 22:31.820
up almost all know in physics, which until then relied completely on particles interacting through

22:31.820 --> 22:35.180
forces which with each other in space and time.

22:37.590 --> 22:41.250
So Heisenberg reasoned as follows.

22:43.140 --> 22:51.300
Let us suppose that we want to determine with a high precision the position of a particle, notice that

22:51.300 --> 22:58.800
in this figure here, the x axis is the vertical one, not the horizontal.

22:59.710 --> 23:03.910
Along the vertical line, we have the X variable.

23:06.090 --> 23:11.070
Imagine the particle coming from the left with a specific amount of momentum.

23:11.390 --> 23:19.050
We recall that the momentum of a particle in classical, non relativistic mechanics is just the quantity

23:19.050 --> 23:25.650
of motion of an object and is given by the product product of its mass times, its velocity.

23:26.310 --> 23:30.570
Generally, it is a vector quantity, which means it is also a direction.

23:31.920 --> 23:39.840
Let us also recall that as we have discussed in the lecture on the elite relation, once momentum is

23:39.840 --> 23:44.010
given in quantum physics, we can relate to every particle.

23:44.010 --> 23:48.600
Also a wavelength as that equal H of a p.

23:50.760 --> 23:58.680
This particle, which we must intend as a transverse plane wave, is an incident on the diffraction

23:58.680 --> 24:03.810
plane with one slit open hole of size Delta X.

24:05.780 --> 24:13.220
This particle that is this plane wave, once it has passed through, the slit, will be deflected and

24:13.220 --> 24:19.040
shortly after interact on the detection screen at the position, according to a probabilistic law,

24:19.070 --> 24:24.320
which is determined by the interference pattern, as you certainly know by now.

24:26.180 --> 24:34.820
So the particle, even without any interaction from outside forces and even with no physical disturbance

24:34.820 --> 24:41.810
from the environment, and even by constructing an experimental set up, which is perfect and ideal

24:42.320 --> 24:48.340
without any imprecision, will nevertheless be displaced on the screen.

24:48.710 --> 24:50.510
The vertical x axis.

24:52.280 --> 25:03.110
This happens because of our attempt to localize the particle in that tiny region, Delta X, Letter

25:03.110 --> 25:10.400
X. We can arrange our experiment as we wish, but if the size of the slit is comparable to the wavelength

25:10.400 --> 25:19.490
of the photon or to the temporary wavelength of a material particle, then we will always and inevitably

25:19.700 --> 25:28.370
note that the particle after it passed the slit, the slit of six Delta X will be displaced on the screen

25:28.370 --> 25:37.940
according to the laws of interference diffraction and to the laws determining the behavior of waves.

25:38.990 --> 25:42.400
There is no way to avoid this interference phenomenon.

25:44.310 --> 25:52.470
Now, this could also be interpreted as if the particle, once it has gone through the slit, will acquire

25:52.500 --> 26:01.680
an extra momentum delta along the vertical axis, this does not happen because of the interaction of

26:01.680 --> 26:10.020
an outside force or as we might imagine, naively by an interaction, deviation or bouncing effect of

26:10.020 --> 26:16.470
the particle with as little edges, because in that case, we would observe a random distribution,

26:16.680 --> 26:20.070
but not an interference pattern characteristic of waves.

26:21.510 --> 26:28.860
This extra momentum Delta P, which displaces the particle along the detection screen, is due only

26:28.860 --> 26:32.970
and exclusively to the wave nature of matter and light.

26:34.410 --> 26:41.280
We might interpret this also as a scattering of the particle, but we should keep in mind that this

26:41.280 --> 26:46.510
is a misleading terminology since there is no scattering force at all.

26:46.980 --> 26:53.250
It does not need any scattering interaction of forces from the outside to make this happen.

26:54.850 --> 26:58.720
So where does this extra momentum Delta P come from?

26:59.900 --> 27:05.520
It is just the uncertainty we have about the particles momentum in the first place.

27:05.840 --> 27:13.670
It is an inherent uncertainty of the properties of any particle due to their wave nature.

27:13.910 --> 27:22.400
So this is the only possible conclusion if we want to avoid violation of the principles of conservation,

27:22.400 --> 27:24.020
of momentum and energy.

27:25.760 --> 27:33.410
The point is that we will never be able to determine with extreme precision, that is with an infinitely

27:33.410 --> 27:44.360
small slit of size, Delta X equals zero without blurring the momentum in space around the vertical

27:44.360 --> 27:50.210
axis, since by doing so, we inevitably will diffract the plane wavefront.

27:51.200 --> 27:58.490
The wavelength of which is given by the debris relation, and this inevitably will displace the particle

27:58.490 --> 28:06.140
of the photon according to a statistical law which reflects the deflection and interference laws.

28:08.810 --> 28:16.460
So we must conclude that the smaller our uncertainty in determining the particles position, the size

28:17.180 --> 28:25.700
of the slit, the larger will be the diffraction effects and therefore also the larger the uncertainty

28:25.700 --> 28:33.550
over the momentum that the P of the particle that becomes therefore large in the vertical direction.

28:35.020 --> 28:43.900
On the other hand, if I want to know the political momentum was small uncertainty, that is, I would

28:43.900 --> 28:50.230
like to maintain Delta Small, then we will have to open up those little aperture.

28:50.740 --> 28:56.710
This means Delta X must be large in order to reduce the disruption.

28:57.940 --> 29:04.960
But I will never, ever be able to determine with precision both the momentum and the position of a

29:04.960 --> 29:07.550
particle was the same at the same time.

29:08.680 --> 29:17.050
We have to chose if we want to keep focused on one or the other, never, ever are we allowed to obtain

29:17.050 --> 29:17.590
both.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.090
Not because we interfere with the system.

29:23.110 --> 29:29.100
This is also another misleading misconception, but because we are dealing with waves of.

29:31.890 --> 29:38.370
We have, however, interference fringes here, and in principle, the particle can displace itself

29:38.370 --> 29:45.960
also very far away from the center of the screen, especially if the slits or is dark with the slit

29:46.270 --> 29:49.330
we have only a single single cell becomes very small.

29:50.550 --> 29:53.610
But this also happens with a decreasing probability.

29:55.180 --> 30:02.770
It is much more probable to find the particle hitting the screen at the central white peaks higher peaks

30:02.770 --> 30:10.600
than at the little ones far away from the center, for practical reasons, one must set a limit as a

30:10.600 --> 30:16.570
convention due to statistical reasons which will be clarified in the next sections.

30:16.930 --> 30:24.340
One takes as conventional the normal distribution which states that Delta P is the width of the central

30:24.340 --> 30:26.050
fringe corresponding to.

30:27.110 --> 30:32.900
Sixty eight point three percent of all of the particles it contains.

30:34.300 --> 30:41.500
Because this is a central region with high intensity and therefore that region where we have the highest

30:41.500 --> 30:43.760
probability to detect a single particle.

30:44.800 --> 30:50.770
In fact, as we have seen with the signals, let the secondary interference interference fringes beyond

30:50.770 --> 30:57.550
the central one are usually quite small, usually also smaller, smaller than the in this figure.

30:59.580 --> 31:06.990
So this means that to a specific amount of Delta X, we must expect to find also a specific amount of

31:06.990 --> 31:07.640
Delta P?

31:08.250 --> 31:09.600
Yeah, always.

31:09.600 --> 31:19.500
And inevitably, by the laws of nature, Heisenberg was also able to show that the product of these

31:19.500 --> 31:30.870
two uncertain quantities is a constant and summed up this with his famous and extremely important inequality,

31:31.440 --> 31:45.060
which states that Delta X times Delta B is greater equal each bar half where each bar is the plank's

31:45.060 --> 31:49.590
content constant age divided by two times pi.

31:51.370 --> 31:55.300
This is a mathematical way to state what we have said so far.

31:55.780 --> 32:04.360
If you force the value of the photon of a particle to be tight, it will always have an uncertainty

32:04.360 --> 32:14.050
over the momentum of Delta P greater equal H over two times Delta X. But that is a precise measurement

32:14.050 --> 32:22.090
of the particle position will imply and uncertainty over its momentum is more Delta X inducers delta

32:22.950 --> 32:26.170
to become large viceversa.

32:26.290 --> 32:32.890
If you force the value of the momentum of a particle into a narrow range of values, it will always

32:32.890 --> 32:40.960
have an uncertainty over the position of Delta X and greater or equal age over two times.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.560
Delta P.

32:43.030 --> 32:51.430
This is an inequality which can be obtained in several ways, and one closely related to this is via

32:51.430 --> 32:58.600
the so-called Fourier transforms, and that is it is a mathematical tool that the composers signal in

32:58.600 --> 33:06.100
time, such as a complicated travelling wave into many sine and cosine functions of different frequencies,

33:07.000 --> 33:14.230
or as it is done in modern quantum theory, Heisenberg's inequality is obtained through a mathematical

33:14.230 --> 33:18.400
operator theory approach, which is mathematically more rigorous.

33:18.820 --> 33:19.270
But.

33:20.640 --> 33:27.570
Frankly, obscures somehow the deeper meaning of the Heisenberg principle, really related to the wave

33:27.570 --> 33:28.750
nature of matter.

33:29.490 --> 33:37.320
At any rate, always keep what was important point is always to keep in mind this little but very important

33:37.320 --> 33:43.020
inequality, since it will turn up more or less everywhere and quantum mechanics.

33:44.490 --> 33:53.700
Now, let us analyze what interpretation Heisenberg himself gave to this to his own principal.

33:54.690 --> 34:02.280
He illustrated this with a famous thought experiment by thought experiment, which is kind of the meaning

34:02.280 --> 34:10.770
comes from the German Gattung experiment in science, one means an ideal experiment which could be realized

34:10.770 --> 34:18.810
in principle and does not as such, violate violate the laws of physics, but can't be performed in

34:18.810 --> 34:23.760
practice due to technological limitations or other constraints.

34:25.230 --> 34:31.980
Heisenberg's thought experiment elucidated what nowadays is remembered as the Heisenberg microscope

34:31.980 --> 34:32.970
interpretation.

34:33.960 --> 34:40.770
It is an interpretation that unfortunately also several professional physicists adopt, probably to

34:40.770 --> 34:49.410
make it more understandable, understandable and appealing to the public or first year students.

34:49.830 --> 34:55.860
But if you have followed carefully what we have said so far, you shall be able to recognize that Heisenberg's

34:55.860 --> 34:59.350
interpretation is somewhat misleading, to say the least.

35:00.930 --> 35:04.650
This experiment went as follows a thought experiment.

35:04.890 --> 35:11.970
Imagine we want to detect the position and momentum of a particle in a region that acts by using an

35:11.970 --> 35:13.080
incoming photon.

35:14.150 --> 35:23.930
The green wavy arrow here, which hits the particle, this photon is then scattered towards some direction,

35:23.930 --> 35:28.610
say, along the direction represented by the red wavy arrow.

35:29.990 --> 35:37.910
We have already described something similar with a compensatory effect then so was the reasoning of

35:37.910 --> 35:39.020
Heisenberg Heisenberg.

35:39.830 --> 35:47.510
We can look to where the photon has been shattered and we should be able to deduce the electrons position.

35:48.920 --> 35:57.140
So we just look with the microscope, we see the scattered photo and say are the particle was just there

35:57.140 --> 36:00.650
in that position that X is or was at least.

36:02.700 --> 36:11.400
However, the problem is that according to classical optics, the larger the angular aperture data of

36:11.400 --> 36:18.870
the microscope is, the better it will resolve the position of the scattered photon and therefore deduce

36:18.870 --> 36:20.390
the position of the electron.

36:21.600 --> 36:29.310
But this angular aperture does not only depend on the size of the microscope lens its lens, but also

36:29.310 --> 36:36.810
on the wavelength of the photon itself to have a high precision in determining from which direction

36:36.810 --> 36:37.910
the photon comes.

36:38.220 --> 36:43.310
That is, in determining the position, the original position, at least of the electron.

36:43.860 --> 36:47.310
We must use a photon with a short wavelength.

36:48.640 --> 36:55.690
But and this is the point, if the photon has a short wavelength, which means high frequency, it will

36:55.690 --> 37:04.510
carry more momentum because it is more energetic due to Plank's relation, as you might recall, and

37:04.510 --> 37:10.450
the kick it imparts to the electron will therefore be also larger.

37:11.890 --> 37:19.210
That is, if I want to observe the precise position of the electron with this microscope, I must use

37:19.220 --> 37:25.620
photons which will produce a larger recoil on the electron itself.

37:26.290 --> 37:30.850
And this makes its position again, indeterminate.

37:32.360 --> 37:40.730
On the other hand, if I want to determine more precisely the momentum of a particle, then I'm forced

37:40.730 --> 37:50.450
to use photons with large wavelengths, since only these have a small momentum and will not displace

37:50.630 --> 37:54.470
the electron too much through constant scattering.

37:55.800 --> 38:03.960
But if I use long wavelengths, what long wavelength photons, the microscope optics will resolve its

38:03.960 --> 38:06.150
position with less accuracy.

38:07.710 --> 38:13.500
So again, we have to search for a trade off between the wavelength we use.

38:14.010 --> 38:20.260
That is the precision, the precision over the momentum, Delta P and the microscope aperture.

38:20.790 --> 38:24.510
That is the capability to look at the precise position.

38:24.510 --> 38:25.990
At the precise point.

38:26.010 --> 38:26.790
Delta X.

38:30.200 --> 38:35.900
In the macroscopic world, this effect does not play any role for practical purposes, even though,

38:35.900 --> 38:44.120
strictly speaking, it always holds because objects are huge and are not disturbed by tiny photons.

38:44.930 --> 38:53.090
However, for atoms and even more for particles like electrons, a single photon can also disturb them

38:53.090 --> 38:58.100
and scatter them away, preventing us from determining their properties.

38:59.490 --> 39:03.950
That is why Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is invoked.

39:03.950 --> 39:10.910
To explain that in the microscope, the microscopic world, a measurement always perturbs a system in

39:10.910 --> 39:18.860
such a way that the scale of the measurements perturbation is about the same magnitude of the effect

39:18.860 --> 39:26.000
it produces and therefore renders imprecise, if not at all useless.

39:26.150 --> 39:26.930
The result?

39:28.980 --> 39:36.420
Heisenberg was able to show that by reasoning in such manner, making the appropriate calculations,

39:36.660 --> 39:46.500
which is to classical optics, he could indeed obtain his own famous inequality of momentum and position.

39:48.060 --> 39:53.060
Heisenberg's microscope thought experiment boils down to the following argument.

39:53.580 --> 39:59.400
We cannot determine the position and momentum of a particle at the same time, because when we make

39:59.400 --> 40:06.270
an observation, we inevitably must interact with the object, with the object we want to observe,

40:07.110 --> 40:13.580
such as sending other particles of comparable mass or energy of the particle to be observed.

40:14.250 --> 40:22.950
And this inevitably disturbs the system, which then loses its original position and momentum that we

40:22.950 --> 40:24.120
sought to determine.

40:27.310 --> 40:34.850
But this interpretation, however, is in stark contrast to the wave particle nature of matter itself.

40:35.680 --> 40:41.140
It is interpretation and interpretation that does not stand up to the test of modern modern quantum

40:41.140 --> 40:41.610
theory.

40:42.550 --> 40:48.820
The popular belief that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is about the interaction between the observer

40:48.820 --> 40:51.040
and the observed object is wrong.

40:52.060 --> 40:58.690
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is a fundamental law of nature, which has its rules in the way nature

40:58.690 --> 41:04.630
of matter and has nothing to do with the interaction between the measuring apparatus and the measured

41:04.630 --> 41:05.320
objects.

41:06.580 --> 41:13.000
Of course, the interactions and the imperfections of measurement devices must always take, must be

41:13.000 --> 41:16.170
always taken into account in a real laboratory.

41:17.050 --> 41:26.000
But this adds further uncertainty to the intrinsic quantum fuzziness that is present apriori.

41:26.680 --> 41:36.910
In fact, we shall see later on that, as strange as it might sound by now, it is nevertheless perfectly

41:36.910 --> 41:44.170
possible to set up experiments which make measurements without necessarily interacting with the system.

41:45.280 --> 41:50.090
And yet the Heisenberg uncertainty principle remains inescapable.

41:51.790 --> 41:54.910
We will see this late in Coming Lecture's.

41:55.860 --> 42:03.120
It also also shows that the principle holds also in the case where we are able to reduce to zero any

42:03.120 --> 42:11.280
interaction with the observed object, it is an inherent law of nature that is independent from observational

42:11.280 --> 42:12.150
interactions.

42:13.740 --> 42:21.090
At the Times of Heisenberg, it was still legitimate to think of particles in this way, Heisenberg

42:21.420 --> 42:27.750
can be excused because several experiments which showed how his own interpretation must be revised,

42:27.960 --> 42:28.980
came much later.

42:29.760 --> 42:37.140
Some not even until before the 1990s, with the development of sophisticated laser and quantum optics

42:37.140 --> 42:38.300
optics devices.

42:39.240 --> 42:47.310
So why the the historical context and the lack of more experimental evidence justifies Heisenberg not

42:47.310 --> 42:48.870
so modern physicist?

42:49.410 --> 42:55.800
Nowadays, we can no longer stick with the microscope interpretation as a correct understanding of how

42:55.800 --> 42:57.780
the uncertainty principle works.

42:58.500 --> 43:04.890
This is no less fundamental than the geocentric model of or flat earth theory.

43:05.790 --> 43:12.810
We should accept that nature is telling us that we should never forget that wave particle duality.

43:13.740 --> 43:20.280
When a particle goes through a pinhole, we must think of it as a physical process described by transverse

43:20.640 --> 43:29.550
plana waves, which a meter wave which is refracted like any other wave and produces a spherical wavefront

43:30.360 --> 43:32.940
not more nor less than in this figure.

43:34.930 --> 43:41.310
Quantum mechanics, the classical understanding of particles which possess definite properties, such

43:41.310 --> 43:50.370
a position which move along precise trajectories and possess a definite momentum, must be taken with

43:50.370 --> 43:51.240
great care.

43:52.560 --> 44:00.220
There are no positions or momenta which describe a particle we must seriously consider.

44:00.240 --> 44:08.790
We must take quantum physics and nature seriously and consider consider instead that these are emergent

44:08.790 --> 44:11.880
qualities, not intrinsic properties.

44:13.060 --> 44:20.530
Particles do not have at all a clear and precise position and momentum as we imagine them to have at

44:20.530 --> 44:22.840
our microscopic level.

44:22.990 --> 44:31.210
And as our naive, intuitive, intuitive understanding wants to make us believe, quantum physics seems

44:31.210 --> 44:38.770
to suggest that the physical objects we imagine as point like hard material, material, billiard balls

44:39.280 --> 44:48.160
are instead entities which are intrinsically somewhat fuzzy with no sharp and well-defined boundaries,

44:48.550 --> 44:59.140
and that travel throughout space as waves that eventually then collapse to a point somewhere, interacting

44:59.140 --> 45:01.720
with some detectors or whatever.

45:03.540 --> 45:11.610
This nature of particles is independent of the precision of our measurement apparatus and independent

45:11.610 --> 45:18.840
of the fact that we interact or not by observing it, the position and velocity of particles is independent

45:18.840 --> 45:21.840
from what we know in the classical world in which we live.

45:23.100 --> 45:27.120
Therefore, indeterminacy is not a matter of ignorance.

45:27.990 --> 45:33.620
Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not a principle about a lack of information.

45:34.410 --> 45:41.700
It is not about particles, but which we cannot determine their whereabouts and speed.

45:42.620 --> 45:51.390
It is about physical entities that simply do not have anything to do with our anthropomorphic imagination.

45:52.160 --> 45:57.650
To sum up this lecture, we must keep in mind, therefore, the following things.

45:58.840 --> 46:06.370
First of all, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is not a principle about the lack of precision of

46:06.370 --> 46:07.000
measurements.

46:08.460 --> 46:16.140
Then Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is an intrinsic aspect and law of nature, which arises due

46:16.140 --> 46:25.950
to the particle wave duality and finally, even an ideal measurement instrument with infinite precision

46:26.130 --> 46:28.170
must nevertheless obey it.

46:29.960 --> 46:35.270
These are the important aspects that distinguish classical from quantum physics.
