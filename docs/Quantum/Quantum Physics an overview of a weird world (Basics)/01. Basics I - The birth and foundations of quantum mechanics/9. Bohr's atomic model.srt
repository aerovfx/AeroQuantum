00:00.330 --> 00:08.100
At this point, physicist had a sufficiently large mass of experimental and conceptual understanding

00:08.280 --> 00:17.370
of the physics of atoms to go a step further, the idea that matter emits and absorbs electromagnetic

00:17.370 --> 00:23.780
energy in a discrete manner had become at the time and established and accepted fact.

00:25.020 --> 00:31.560
What was missing, however, was a structural model which could at least partially explain this.

00:33.040 --> 00:40.050
Ernest Rutherford, a physicist from New Zealand, discovered in 1911.

00:41.480 --> 00:49.580
By performing certainly scattering experiments with radioactive particles that atoms are almost empty

00:49.580 --> 00:58.610
objects, since more than 99 percent of the mass of an atom is concentrated inside a tiny, positively

00:58.610 --> 00:59.900
charged nucleus.

01:01.170 --> 01:09.630
Putting things together a couple of years later, Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist conceived of the atom

01:09.960 --> 01:18.510
as a kind of tiny solar system with the negative electrons circling around the positively charged nucleus

01:18.810 --> 01:20.320
made of protons.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.610
This is the model most of you may have encountered in school.

01:27.030 --> 01:36.030
What characterizes Borse model was that it is it still retains the idea of electrons flying along very

01:36.030 --> 01:38.670
well defined and precise orbits.

01:39.750 --> 01:44.370
Every orbit can be occupied by a certain number of electrons.

01:45.750 --> 01:52.020
Moreover, every orbit corresponds to some energy level of the electrons in the atom.

01:53.430 --> 02:01.380
And there were no intermediate orbits, only orbits corresponding to specific energy levels, which

02:01.380 --> 02:08.110
can be labeled with progressive integer numbers and equal one to three and so on.

02:09.540 --> 02:17.880
These numbers were called and are called so until today, principle quantum numbers, because these

02:17.880 --> 02:21.820
define the possible discrete energy states of the atom.

02:23.070 --> 02:30.240
This was the first atomic model that could explain partially at least, why atoms absorb and emit light.

02:30.240 --> 02:34.350
Indiscreet quantities is the orbits are fixed.

02:34.890 --> 02:42.570
Then also the energy levels of electrons in those orbits around the nucleus must be discrete.

02:43.590 --> 02:50.730
The energy, absorption and recommission is conceptually visualized with the transition of an electron

02:50.730 --> 02:52.520
from one orbit to another.

02:53.580 --> 03:02.190
If an electron absorbs a photon coming from the outside from the environment, then it transits towards

03:02.190 --> 03:09.660
a higher orbit, but then will quickly readmit the photon back by returning to the lower energy level

03:09.660 --> 03:10.110
orbit.

03:11.770 --> 03:19.720
Remission, of course, because every system will always tend to return towards the lowest energy level

03:19.720 --> 03:27.910
possible, since there is an empty place left by the Electrum, it will reoccupy it back by emission

03:28.300 --> 03:30.030
of electromagnetic waves.

03:31.120 --> 03:37.690
It is not necessary that the that the that the transition be between neighbouring orbits, but could

03:37.690 --> 03:40.990
also occur between orbits with very different quantum numbers.

03:42.340 --> 03:49.720
The difference, however, in any case, in energy of the two orbits will be just that energy that the

03:49.720 --> 03:51.940
electron absorbs and emits.

03:52.960 --> 03:59.470
And this energy difference will also be that which determines the frequency or the wavelength of the

03:59.470 --> 04:04.390
absorbed and emitted photon, according to Planck's formula.

04:07.240 --> 04:15.910
This model could indeed explain the atomic spectra of the hydrogen atom, measured experimentally like

04:15.910 --> 04:21.400
this one for the hydrogen atom and that we have already seen before.

04:22.300 --> 04:29.710
For every electron transition from one orbit to the other, in each of its possible combinations, one

04:29.710 --> 04:37.000
can calculate the the energy difference and there of the energy and wavelength of the absorbed or emitted

04:37.000 --> 04:37.600
photon.

04:38.960 --> 04:45.430
Yes, summarizing a qualitative picture of some of these possibilities is displayed.

04:46.450 --> 04:52.000
For example, the transition to the ground state quantum number, an equal one.

04:52.180 --> 04:57.560
Sometimes it's physicists use quantum number and equal zero.

04:57.580 --> 05:02.140
As for the ground state, but in our case I put an equal one.

05:02.740 --> 05:09.730
So corresponding to the energy e0 zero from all the above discrete electron orbits and equal to an equal

05:09.730 --> 05:20.720
three, etc. of energy one, two, etc. emit photons of the energy each one minus zero e two minus eight

05:20.770 --> 05:24.160
zero three minus eight zero and so on.

05:25.550 --> 05:34.430
This is the so-called Lehman series of hydrogen, of the hydrogen spectral lines, many other possibilities

05:34.430 --> 05:43.820
other than that, which means many other possible serious exists, each labeled with the name of its

05:43.820 --> 05:44.480
discoverer.

05:45.900 --> 05:55.680
In this figure, you have that Lehman series is depicted here on the left in this blue picture as a

05:55.680 --> 06:00.630
transition which corresponds to an emission of photons.

06:00.640 --> 06:09.210
In fact, you have the electrons falling down to the quantum, to the energy state corresponding to

06:09.210 --> 06:11.070
the quantum number and equal one.

06:12.990 --> 06:22.390
But this could be also an absorption not only in emission, for example, for the Bulmer serious here,

06:22.400 --> 06:32.400
you can see that you have the same thing only in the opposite direction, but with the electrons absorbing

06:32.430 --> 06:40.410
a quantity of energy from an energy level corresponding to the quantum number and equal to therefore

06:40.410 --> 06:47.490
to the second orbit electron orbit up to the third, fourth, fifth and so on orbit.

06:47.940 --> 06:56.040
On the right side, you have a similar scheme which may which is only shown graphically in energy levels

06:56.040 --> 07:00.320
instead of using the picture of orbits.

07:01.320 --> 07:09.480
And you can see that you have also an energy level, infinite, which means nothing else than the electron

07:09.630 --> 07:21.750
comes from the far outside and falls into the field and domain of interaction of the nucleus of the

07:21.750 --> 07:28.920
hydrogen atom, which is obviously the proton, which means so it comes from the infinite distance and

07:28.920 --> 07:33.390
falls onto into this orbital.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.740
Atomic model, which is Borse model.

07:39.040 --> 07:46.870
And again, also for the other serious passion and bracket, serious and so on, these are the cases

07:46.870 --> 07:53.050
where the energy friends of the emitted or absorbed photon is equal, that where you have a transition

07:53.050 --> 08:01.120
from some orbit or from some quantum energy level or quantum that with some quantum number down to Itou

08:01.750 --> 08:06.850
in the case of passion, serious and down to E three in case of bracket serious.

08:08.600 --> 08:20.150
So this was, broadly speaking, the model of Atum, it might be interesting also to say to explain

08:20.150 --> 08:27.980
as a further historical side note, uh, it might be worth to mention that both Atem atomic model was

08:27.980 --> 08:36.500
even refined and extended by are not Sommerfeld Sommerfeld, a German physicist who considered also

08:36.500 --> 08:41.720
elliptical electron orbits just as we know it from planetary orbits.

08:42.170 --> 08:45.340
Planetary orbits are all elliptical.

08:45.590 --> 08:52.130
The circular, perfectly circular orbit, impractical in practice, does not exist.

08:52.430 --> 08:53.630
It is only an ideal.

08:53.690 --> 09:03.110
It is idealisation and and this is an interesting historical anecdote since it shows how we as humans

09:03.110 --> 09:10.490
are instinctively driven first by the desire to transfer our understanding of the macrocosm onto the

09:10.490 --> 09:11.330
microcosm.

09:11.540 --> 09:12.940
And sometimes it works.

09:12.950 --> 09:16.370
In fact, this attempt was not without success.

09:16.910 --> 09:25.280
Sommerfeld Sommerfeld introduced a second quantum number, the so-called Orbital or Atsumi quantum number.

09:25.310 --> 09:29.730
Er the first was and this is L a.

09:30.990 --> 09:41.340
Which for each principal quantum number end specifies nd allowed orbital angular momentum of the electron

09:41.340 --> 09:44.240
around the atom atomic nucleus.

09:44.460 --> 09:52.290
So you have that l the second quantum number that Sommerfeld introduced, equal zero one, two and so

09:52.290 --> 09:54.260
on until N minus one.

09:55.320 --> 10:03.390
And these levels are also designated as Espie, the EFG and so on.

10:03.420 --> 10:13.200
Also with letters and which characterizes the ratio between the same samey, major and minor axis that

10:13.200 --> 10:18.150
is the elongation of the corresponding electron orbit.

10:19.880 --> 10:28.460
This more general, more sommerfeld model was able to accurately explain a number of more complex atomic

10:28.460 --> 10:37.640
spectral spectral lines, indeed, um, it provided a partial at least an approximated explanation of

10:37.640 --> 10:43.670
the splitting of some spectral lines that were observed due to the presence of strong external electric

10:43.670 --> 10:51.280
fields called this is an effect called the stark effect, or of magnetic fields, which is called also

10:51.290 --> 10:52.360
that Zeeman effect.

10:53.780 --> 11:01.460
It was a quite exciting success at the time, since this seemed to indicate that physicists were after

11:01.460 --> 11:05.270
something that could lead them in the right direction.

11:07.160 --> 11:16.640
However, also many inconsistencies became clear soon the summer was able to make these predictions

11:16.820 --> 11:19.490
of the atomic hydrogen.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.970
And spectral lines.

11:24.380 --> 11:32.060
But first of all, only with limited precision and and and and also, at any rate, only for the for

11:32.060 --> 11:40.400
the hydrogen spectra, while all the other elements of the periodic table, not to say the molecular

11:40.400 --> 11:45.980
energy levels and structure cannot be explained by such a simple theory.

11:47.740 --> 11:56.770
Both atomic model and the more I find both some Sommerfeld atomic model was an attempt to explain atomic

11:56.770 --> 12:03.880
behavior and energy states, and it is indeed an interesting historical remnant of the intellectual

12:03.880 --> 12:06.440
intellectual journey of humankind.

12:06.460 --> 12:15.940
In my opinion, it made perfect sense when viewed in that historical context, but nowadays it is no

12:15.940 --> 12:17.500
longer tenable.

12:18.010 --> 12:18.950
Absolutely not.

12:18.970 --> 12:26.770
Unfortunately, it is still taught in schools as if it were the final sentence, sentence and summation

12:26.770 --> 12:28.060
of atomic physics.

12:29.850 --> 12:37.500
Whereas quantum mechanics will explain things much more accurately and precisely as we shall see later,

12:38.280 --> 12:44.910
it was only with the advent of quantum physics and its application to atomic to the atomic structure

12:44.910 --> 12:48.510
that science could correctly predict atomic spectra.

12:49.740 --> 12:56.460
The atomic model that arises from quantum mechanics, will be completely different than that, of course,

12:56.460 --> 13:06.540
or sommerfeld model, and which could only be considered temporary, such as finally Ossabaw himself

13:06.900 --> 13:07.860
had to admit.
