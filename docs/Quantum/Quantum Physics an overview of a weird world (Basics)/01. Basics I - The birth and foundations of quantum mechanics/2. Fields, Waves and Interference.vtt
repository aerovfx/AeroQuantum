00:00.900 --> 00:10.840
So what does it mean that two waves or many waves interfere with each other, what is interference?

00:11.700 --> 00:17.840
It is extremely important that you understand, at least intuitively, what interference is about.

00:18.480 --> 00:25.320
It is so important because it is the physical effect that stands behind a lot of phenomena in all quantum

00:25.320 --> 00:25.800
physics.

00:26.940 --> 00:35.280
Without the wave description in the interference of, so to speak, wavy phenomena, almost nothing

00:35.280 --> 00:37.200
can be said in quantum physics.

00:37.980 --> 00:48.630
Let us see how light is conceived of as an oscillating electromagnetic field and how these fields interfere

00:48.900 --> 00:49.940
with each others.

00:50.970 --> 00:56.130
And before that, let us illustrate what a field is in physics at all.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.450
As a first example, we can take also a force field.

01:00.540 --> 01:05.010
We are more accustomed with that of the force of gravity.

01:06.580 --> 01:14.350
The gravitational field that surrounds a planet like the Earth is a region of space where gravity acts

01:14.350 --> 01:21.000
upon material bodies which are distributed around the earth.

01:23.080 --> 01:31.930
Uh, in empty space for, for instance, the moon interacts with the earth's gravitational field and

01:31.930 --> 01:40.900
also the reverse is true, that the earth feels, so to speak, a force originating from the gravitational

01:40.900 --> 01:41.740
field of the moon.

01:42.310 --> 01:47.620
So these are two mutually mutually interacting gravitational fields.

01:49.940 --> 01:57.530
Also, other forces acting upon objects exist, namely the electric and magnetic forces.

01:58.540 --> 02:06.100
The actions of which on the surrounding space can be visualized with the field in motion as well.

02:07.210 --> 02:15.040
What distinguishes the electric and magnetic field forces, fields or just field forces from the gravitational

02:15.040 --> 02:20.950
one is that the former can be both attractive as well as a repulsive.

02:20.950 --> 02:25.840
In contrast to the latter, the gravity which we know can be only attractive.

02:27.430 --> 02:34.480
Electric and magnetic forces are therefore characterized, characterized by a polarity, positive and

02:34.480 --> 02:39.040
negative electric charges north and south magnetic poles.

02:41.120 --> 02:47.990
Well, a detailed description of these fees would require a lengthy elaboration that is not essential

02:47.990 --> 02:49.250
for our purposes here.

02:50.060 --> 02:59.720
It may only be highlighted that when an electric field changes in time oscillates, for instance, periodically

02:59.720 --> 03:01.280
oscillating electric field.

03:02.570 --> 03:07.160
This always induces a corresponding magnetic field.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.200
It is, in fact, called the phenomenon of electric electromagnetic induction.

03:14.140 --> 03:21.280
The other way around is through also an oscillating magnetic field always gives rise to a corresponding

03:21.280 --> 03:22.810
oscillating electric field.

03:24.350 --> 03:32.120
The two never exist separately when one or the other varies in time, if there is no variation, you

03:32.120 --> 03:36.580
can see a magnetic or an electric field separately from each other.

03:36.590 --> 03:46.440
But when there is a variation in time, always must be present both in some way or another.

03:47.540 --> 03:55.790
This is the reason why physicists speak of oscillating electromagnetic fields, unifying with the concept

03:55.970 --> 04:04.610
of electricity and magnetism in a unique and inseparable physical entity, a concept that is central

04:04.610 --> 04:09.950
in Maxwell's equations, the electromagnetic field or the electromagnetic waves.

04:10.820 --> 04:18.740
In fact, this can be visualized in the image here with an electric and magnetic component oscillating

04:18.740 --> 04:22.970
in time and travelling in space up to the speed of light.

04:24.380 --> 04:31.820
Electric and magnetic forces have a direction and the strength and for this reason are represented graphically

04:32.030 --> 04:43.130
as across the length of which indicate the magnitude of the field in each point of space and its direction

04:43.970 --> 04:47.660
is it is the orientation of the acting force.

04:48.920 --> 04:56.990
Mathematically, one represents these so-called errors by vectors see also more information on this

04:57.890 --> 05:07.160
in the mathematical review in the appendix for more information about this as shown in the figures,

05:07.550 --> 05:11.810
it has become a convention to level the vector of the electric force.

05:11.810 --> 05:20.990
Was it was a capital letter E and that of the magnetic one with capital letters B formally, each component

05:20.990 --> 05:27.890
of an electromagnetic field can be represented by a function of these vectors changing in time while

05:27.890 --> 05:30.620
moving along that that direction.

05:32.070 --> 05:41.730
The oscillation, the oscillation plain of the electric field in the figure, the vertical plane determines

05:41.730 --> 05:44.570
the so-called polarization plain of the wave.

05:45.840 --> 05:54.270
Remember, always there are two waves can have the same wavelength or frequency, if you prefer, in

05:54.270 --> 05:56.310
the same direction of propagation.

05:57.370 --> 06:06.220
But can also have different polarizations, the orientation of this plane determines the orientation

06:06.220 --> 06:08.200
of the polarization of the wave.

06:09.220 --> 06:16.030
In this case, we have vertical polarization, but of course, any other orientation is possible as

06:16.510 --> 06:20.080
the horizontal one or any other in between.

06:22.410 --> 06:28.770
It can be shown that since the electric field is a result of a changing magnetic field in time and vice

06:28.770 --> 06:35.280
versa, the electric vector must always be perpendicular to the magnetic one.

06:36.120 --> 06:45.330
And as you can see through this oscillatory field, we can associate a wavelength lambda, which is

06:45.330 --> 06:53.490
the measure of the waves size, so to speak, or more precisely, the length between two identical field

06:53.490 --> 06:56.640
vectors with the same amplitude and direction.

06:57.680 --> 07:05.960
Or to put it more simply, twice the distance between two points, well, the field is instantaneously

07:05.960 --> 07:06.440
zero.

07:08.820 --> 07:13.140
Now, how do we know that light is or behaves like a wave?

07:14.580 --> 07:17.930
Well, it is because of the interference phenomena.

07:18.900 --> 07:26.880
To illustrate this, let us take these two waves which have the same amplitude and are in phase like

07:26.880 --> 07:36.870
the one in the left, the left picture, which means that the peak or the valley values, say, of the

07:36.870 --> 07:46.230
electric field of one wave is coincidental in time and space with a peak and valley values of another

07:46.230 --> 07:46.620
wave.

07:48.030 --> 07:55.710
In this case, we will have a peak to peak superposition and they will sum up to form a single wave

07:55.950 --> 08:00.720
with larger amplitude by what is called.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.270
Constructive interference.

08:03.690 --> 08:07.980
This is called constructive interference because they construct upon each other.

08:10.190 --> 08:17.240
Whereas in the case of the opposite situation, that of two overlapping waves with the same amplitude

08:17.240 --> 08:23.480
still, but in this case in a. face like shown here in the right picture.

08:25.140 --> 08:32.490
Then one has a peak to valley superposition, which leads to a destructive interference, and the resultant

08:32.490 --> 08:37.860
signal will be zero because these two waves subtract each other's.

08:40.210 --> 08:47.320
For a situation which is in between constructive and destructive interference, where two or more waves

08:47.320 --> 08:57.640
eventually with different amplitude and phases come together and interfere, then of course you will

08:57.640 --> 09:07.120
get something less regular, quite complicated and not so nicely ordered with a somewhat fuzzy superposition

09:07.120 --> 09:07.750
of waves.

09:08.800 --> 09:16.150
A typical example of this is what you observe when you throw stones into a pond and you get the pattern

09:16.150 --> 09:22.990
where you have some places where the waves add up, other substract or something in between.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.430
We will look at another example of this soon.

09:28.660 --> 09:35.470
But first of all, let's say that this puts us now in a position to describe properly interferons phenomena.

09:36.760 --> 09:44.650
Now we can ask, how precisely do intersecting waves add or subtract from each other?

09:46.950 --> 09:57.030
This can be described very nicely with modern calculous, modern mathematics, and let's just have an

09:57.030 --> 09:58.980
intuitive understanding of these things.

10:00.150 --> 10:02.960
Let us add two ways this functions.

10:03.000 --> 10:13.650
So one of the TMZ to to see the appendix for more insights on how functions are used to describe waves

10:14.070 --> 10:18.360
here, it should only be said that, of course, the X coordinate.

10:19.700 --> 10:29.150
Tells me something about the position we are measuring, the amplitude of the waves, one, two and

10:29.160 --> 10:31.670
three at what instant of time?

10:33.830 --> 10:41.930
These two waves could be representatives of the amplitude of the electric or magnetic field of two light

10:41.930 --> 10:49.040
beams, for example, to keep things simple, let us consider the case of two waves with a different

10:49.040 --> 10:53.330
frequency, but both having the same amplitude like in this case.

10:55.600 --> 11:03.190
We won't go into the calculations, but one can show how with the above described mathematical structure,

11:03.640 --> 11:11.410
the interference resulting from the superposition of both fields looks like the resulting signal shown

11:11.410 --> 11:14.110
in the lower left hand side figure here.

11:15.840 --> 11:24.660
This function still has negative values, and therefore it would not make much sense to use it as a

11:24.660 --> 11:32.030
measure of an intensity of light resulting from this overlap, because, after all, a negative intensity.

11:32.640 --> 11:34.120
Well, I don't know what it means.

11:34.170 --> 11:37.410
It's something meaningless and meaningless concept in physics.

11:37.990 --> 11:46.700
Intensity that we perceive with our eyes must always be something that is described by a positive valued

11:46.710 --> 11:47.320
function.

11:48.780 --> 11:56.280
Therefore, what one does is to square these values, since, as you know, the square of any number,

11:56.700 --> 12:00.660
be it positive or negative, always gives a positive value.

12:01.940 --> 12:08.450
And this is what is done in physics to obtain a light intensity from the electromagnetic oscillatory

12:08.450 --> 12:09.710
field it represents.

12:11.360 --> 12:16.400
One might also ask, why does the second power, why not the force power?

12:17.240 --> 12:26.240
Well, it turns out that the second the square, the squaring of function and taking this as the intensity

12:26.240 --> 12:26.850
of a wave.

12:28.040 --> 12:28.670
It works.

12:29.040 --> 12:36.230
It is the best way to describe how things work out there in the real world.

12:37.100 --> 12:43.760
And the other powers, well, they would work not as good as this in this case, because also the force

12:43.760 --> 12:48.070
power gives always a positive number.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.880
And this is a matter of debate.

12:51.380 --> 12:56.810
Until today, it is seen as something that is not completely clarified, especially in quantum mechanics

12:56.810 --> 12:58.340
with the so-called born rule.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.440
And we will see this later.

13:01.710 --> 13:07.350
But for now, just accept it, we'll see this later and discuss it more in detail.

13:07.650 --> 13:14.670
So taking the square models of the some of these fields leads to the lower right hand side interference

13:14.670 --> 13:15.060
better.

13:15.980 --> 13:24.320
The squared modulus is used because the two functions are usually represented by complex numbers, CNN,

13:24.890 --> 13:25.790
the appendix.

13:27.140 --> 13:35.150
As you can see for this particular case, one obtains to intensity maximum, a couple of them small

13:35.480 --> 13:39.600
and the other two much larger in which appear arranged.

13:39.620 --> 13:44.390
Alternatively, along the horizontal x axis.

13:46.100 --> 13:53.420
Notice that this pattern results only for a particular time t reality, one should say that these peaks

13:53.420 --> 13:57.080
oscillate, changing their intensity with time passing by.

13:57.980 --> 14:05.810
But for light, this oscillatory movement is so extremely fast that it is even not detectable, even

14:05.810 --> 14:09.410
not with this most advanced modern measuring devices.

14:10.760 --> 14:19.250
Keep in mind that the frequency of light take, for example, of yellow light is about five times ten

14:19.250 --> 14:21.530
to the power of 14 hertz.

14:22.700 --> 14:28.970
That is a 500000 billionth of oscillating oscillations per second.

14:30.410 --> 14:37.970
Therefore, since the oscillatory phenomena of the electric and magnetic fields of light occur on a

14:37.970 --> 14:46.430
timescale well beyond the measurable domain for most practical applications, one can just take the

14:46.430 --> 14:50.180
average intensity and ignore the time parameter.

14:50.830 --> 14:56.860
And which turns out to be ours, turns out to be also very good, approximate approximation.

14:58.180 --> 15:04.240
That's why we will frequently skip the time parameter in the description of the slaves and simply write

15:04.240 --> 15:10.240
them as waves with spatial dependence without the time parameter Assai X.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.600
But this will depend from time to time.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.440
We will see this then.

15:16.100 --> 15:24.740
At any rate, the important message to get here is that of how waves interfere and that their intensity

15:24.740 --> 15:28.350
results in constructive and destructive interference patterns.

15:29.600 --> 15:36.800
You said you should now have at least a clear, intuitive understanding of the above described interference

15:36.800 --> 15:41.020
phenomena because it is something we will meet over and over again.
