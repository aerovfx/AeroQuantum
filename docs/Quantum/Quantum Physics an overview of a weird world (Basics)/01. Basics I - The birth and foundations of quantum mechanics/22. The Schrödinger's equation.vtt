00:00.970 --> 00:03.850
Now, what do physicists do with all that?

00:05.050 --> 00:10.450
The point is that if we want to deal with real world measurements, we must specify which information

00:10.450 --> 00:17.440
from this mathematical construct, the wavefunction or state vector we want to extract, that is which

00:17.440 --> 00:22.150
physical quantity, more precisely which dynamic variable we want to measure.

00:22.810 --> 00:28.710
Among them, for example, the position, momentum, the energy, the angular momentum and so on.

00:30.280 --> 00:38.140
What mathematicians and physicists do is to define an operator, which, as the world says, operates

00:38.140 --> 00:46.630
on the wavefunction or state vector to extract, to project, to obtain a specific piece of information

00:46.630 --> 00:53.760
associated with the observable examples of mathematical operator operators.

00:53.770 --> 01:00.550
Every one of us knows are the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators.

01:00.550 --> 01:08.020
For example, the multiplication operator X on two quantities, A and B to obtain and other quantities

01:08.440 --> 01:16.890
C as A times B equal c that simple that this is a meaning of operator at this point is an operator.

01:17.230 --> 01:25.990
Similarly, one can conceive of an more abstract operator, let's call it all, acting on a state vector

01:26.170 --> 01:26.620
CI.

01:27.560 --> 01:34.400
If we consider this operation as a formal equivalence with an act of measurement of a dynamic variable

01:34.700 --> 01:42.980
that is observable of a system, the output of this operation should tell us something about the outcome

01:42.980 --> 01:50.750
of this measurement and which is always a number as a quantity and which usually we will call always

01:50.750 --> 01:58.700
lamda a number, which represents the expected value from this measurement, the so-called eigenvalue.

02:00.330 --> 02:09.680
And you write that the operator all operates on the state lactobacilli and gives is equal lamda times,

02:09.720 --> 02:16.040
BPCI lamda the outcome of a measurement or more broadly, simply an observation.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.090
It could be the perfect example.

02:18.120 --> 02:25.140
The position of a particle lambda would be then it is in position at the position and at three centimeters

02:25.740 --> 02:28.330
in some reference system.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.320
This equation is therefore called the Eigen Funk.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.490
The Eigen equation, sorry, the Igen equation.

02:35.670 --> 02:38.190
It is the mathematical procedure.

02:39.130 --> 02:45.880
We have to perform in order to make predictions once we know the experimental setup and the boundary

02:45.880 --> 02:53.530
conditions stated a bit more precisely, one should say that each dynamic variable, for example, position,

02:53.530 --> 03:01.590
omentum, angular momentum, energy and so on, is associated with an so called self ajoint operator,

03:02.830 --> 03:03.820
the observable.

03:04.710 --> 03:13.920
The operator is the observable associated to that dynamic variable that acts on the state vector of

03:13.920 --> 03:22.140
the quantum of the quantum system CI and which furnishes Escala quantity, the eigenvalue lambda.

03:23.450 --> 03:29.780
I said self ajoint, this is not so important, subagent means that the complex conjugate of the operator

03:29.810 --> 03:36.460
is again the operator, but these mathematical aspects that are not so important for our purposes here

03:36.470 --> 03:43.220
simply remember the connection between the classical notion of dynamic variable and its counterpart

03:43.220 --> 03:46.790
in quantum mechanics as operator, the observable.

03:49.030 --> 03:57.910
To avoid a possible source of confusion, let us state this again from another perspective, operators

03:57.910 --> 04:04.930
are not numbers one, two, three, four, five, etc are numbers, whereas.

04:05.860 --> 04:07.540
Plus minus.

04:09.390 --> 04:18.960
Multiplication or division are binary operators binary because they combine two numbers called operands

04:19.350 --> 04:23.430
to obtain another number, for example, one plus two equals three.

04:24.910 --> 04:36.310
Therefore, it makes no sense to state that if an operator acting on a state function BPCI is equal

04:36.440 --> 04:45.910
lamda times side dog or cat, SPSSI, the state vector, then we can equate all equal lunder.

04:47.110 --> 04:51.700
This makes no sense because you're then equating an operator with a number.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.030
And we have said these are two distinct objects.

04:55.780 --> 05:00.130
That is, one is mistaking apples for bananas.

05:01.660 --> 05:05.080
So this distinction must be clear in our mind.

05:06.070 --> 05:13.240
Moreover, the operators used in quantum mechanics operate on functions rather than on numbers.

05:14.820 --> 05:25.230
Perhaps the simplest, non-trivial, unary operator is the derivation operator, the over the ex unary

05:25.230 --> 05:29.220
because it operates on one function to obtain another function.

05:30.800 --> 05:36.380
For those who know how to take derivatives, for those who do not.

05:36.410 --> 05:39.170
Don't worry, we will not need them anymore.

05:39.830 --> 05:47.150
An example could be that the rebate, the derivation of the exponential function e.

05:48.710 --> 06:00.470
Power to act, which gives two times the same exponential function, two times the power to X, but

06:00.620 --> 06:09.320
nobody would equate the operator the over the X and say this is equal to the operators as one thing

06:09.560 --> 06:11.430
and the numbers are another thing.

06:11.780 --> 06:22.460
Operators act on functions and obtain another function, whereas there are also these big banner operators

06:22.460 --> 06:31.610
we use in our daily experience plus minus charter, which work on function, on numbers and again obtained

06:31.610 --> 06:32.180
numbers.

06:33.440 --> 06:39.080
But in that the quantum operators act on functions and obtain functions.

06:39.920 --> 06:45.830
And these quantum operators, that is observables are also called, by the way.

06:46.560 --> 06:50.870
Q Numbers because they have a formal analogy with numbers.

06:51.530 --> 06:54.530
But remember that they are numbers at all.

06:56.920 --> 07:03.220
Once that has become clear, here are some examples of the observables.

07:05.400 --> 07:16.290
So, for example, in in in in the classical world, we have the position X, whereas this year we have

07:16.350 --> 07:18.020
an example of an observable.

07:18.330 --> 07:22.020
The simplest one is the simplest one is the position operator.

07:22.020 --> 07:30.720
And just we say that the operator for X is that some operator X, which X on the way function and will

07:30.720 --> 07:33.960
give me the position of the Patika.

07:33.990 --> 07:41.070
If that wavefunction is the description of the quantum system, if we want to know the position of a

07:41.070 --> 07:41.610
particle.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.830
Therefore, we have just to multiply the wavefunction with the position variable X and then take the

07:46.830 --> 07:53.820
model square to obtain, as usual, the probability density function of X and which tells us something

07:53.820 --> 07:55.040
about its whereabouts.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.350
The momentum operator that is the observable, which tells me something about the momentum of the particle,

08:04.680 --> 08:15.060
has a form of a derivative operator and it is given by this derivation operator of over a function where

08:15.450 --> 08:24.090
the the over the X times, some constant it will turn out in quantum mechanics that it is minus I times

08:24.090 --> 08:35.160
h bar where I is the imaginary number H bar is Planck's constant divided of by two pi where this comes

08:35.160 --> 08:35.520
from.

08:36.270 --> 08:42.560
This would need all the mathematical interaction and we would see why this is all.

08:42.630 --> 08:52.770
The important point is that you recall that the momentum in classical mechanics was just mass times

08:52.770 --> 08:56.520
the velocity in quantum mechanics.

08:56.530 --> 08:59.220
You must not no longer think as.

09:00.450 --> 09:07.860
Dynamical variables in classical physics, but as operators, that is observables and one operator is

09:07.860 --> 09:14.570
the derivation operator that you may have learned when you have learned a bit of calculus.

09:14.580 --> 09:23.880
If you didn't take a look at the appendix and where we discussed also this aspect, taking the derivative

09:23.880 --> 09:32.250
in space of the wavefunction, therefore time supplying constant bar and an imaginary number will furnish

09:32.250 --> 09:38.160
a mathematical expression that tells us something about the speed of the particle that the wavefunction

09:38.160 --> 09:38.850
describes.

09:40.950 --> 09:47.490
So similarly, the energy operator, which is called the evolution operator, or also Hamiltonian,

09:48.210 --> 09:49.980
has a bit more complex structure.

09:50.370 --> 09:59.970
It is given by a second derivative in space times minus H, but squared over to M, where M is the mass

09:59.970 --> 10:06.660
of the particle, plus A function V of X, which represents the potential energy of the particle.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.630
So we have the operator.

10:09.000 --> 10:18.030
The Hamiltonian age is given by this quantity here, and this is nothing else than an operator, which

10:18.030 --> 10:26.490
if it operates on the way function of a quantum system, it will give me as output the energy of the

10:26.490 --> 10:31.260
system, the oil, the possible energy states of the system.

10:31.950 --> 10:38.370
It is in particular this letter observable, which leads to the famous Schrodinger equation, which

10:38.520 --> 10:46.500
in a compact form can be written here as H operating on the state vector PSI is equal.

10:46.500 --> 10:52.740
The Igan the energy eigenvalue e here in capital letter e e times.

10:52.980 --> 11:01.200
Sorry that this is the Igen equation for the energy state of a system.

11:02.250 --> 11:08.790
Once the wave function of the state vector describing the system is given, one applies the Hamiltonian

11:09.210 --> 11:16.080
as prescribed by the igan equation and we will obtain as eigenvalue e the energy of the state.

11:16.740 --> 11:23.850
The Schrodinger equation is so important because it helps us in obtaining the energy states of any quantum

11:23.850 --> 11:33.600
system as the energy levels of atoms and then nuclei, nuclei or even more complicated objects like

11:33.810 --> 11:34.680
molecules.

11:36.110 --> 11:45.260
Let us make only a brief insertion here that will turn out to be important later, another important

11:45.260 --> 11:51.430
quantity in quantum mechanics is the so-called expectation value of an operator.

11:52.340 --> 11:58.320
That is the average value one obtains by measuring an observable.

11:58.490 --> 12:07.430
Many times it is operatively a fundamental notion in quantum mechanics because in the laboratory, what

12:07.430 --> 12:14.240
one usually must tackle in the real world are average, measured values.

12:15.340 --> 12:26.530
For example, for the position operator X equal small X X, four foot particle one integrates its position

12:27.460 --> 12:35.370
X, weighting it by the probability of finding it in X or in analytical terms.

12:35.620 --> 12:44.680
You can see here it is the integral over all the space, if you wish, or where all the universe of

12:44.680 --> 12:58.180
the way function, say X times the position X times size, the complex conjugate of the wavefunction

12:58.180 --> 12:59.020
itself.

13:01.630 --> 13:11.200
It is the average value of the position of a particle that one expects to obtain after a large number

13:11.200 --> 13:12.050
of measurements.

13:13.360 --> 13:22.720
More generally, this can be written in more compact, compact form by using Dirac's notation, stating

13:22.720 --> 13:31.510
that the expectation value of an operator, a let's call it, just is a letter capital letter.

13:31.510 --> 13:39.640
A in state XYZ is defined as that Brassai.

13:41.590 --> 13:44.140
The operator are on a.

13:45.740 --> 13:47.660
Sigh, as you can see here.

13:49.080 --> 13:56.640
With right with the right hand side, there are brackets as defined in the integral above.

14:03.020 --> 14:12.380
Now, turning back to Schrodinger's equation we saw previously, this is, however, not the most general

14:12.380 --> 14:22.250
equation because this was the time independent Schrodinger equation, while physical systems are in

14:22.250 --> 14:24.720
many cases, time dependent.

14:25.250 --> 14:31.010
There is a factor of time working as everything in the physical world.

14:31.250 --> 14:40.290
It evolves according to time and and we express this by a time dependent function.

14:41.180 --> 14:46.730
Therefore, the time dependent energy operator is called.

14:46.730 --> 14:53.390
There exists also at a time dependent energy operator and which is called evolution, a port operator

14:54.020 --> 14:56.910
and is given by this quantity here.

14:57.380 --> 15:07.790
So we generalize the Hamiltonian to a time dependent operator or parameter to a time t..

15:08.570 --> 15:17.120
And which is age of T equal, uh, quantity, which is again an operator.

15:17.660 --> 15:28.910
The imaginary number times H bar times the derivative operator over time the over the T.

15:30.980 --> 15:39.140
That's why you will frequently find that time dependent Schrodinger equation in this form here you have

15:39.170 --> 15:49.400
the Hamiltonian, that time dependent Hamiltonian who acts on the state vector PSI Kappa Capsid equal

15:50.150 --> 15:51.890
i h bar.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.270
The authority.

15:55.500 --> 15:56.640
Over that.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.330
Same contractor.

16:01.390 --> 16:04.960
This is, again, the time dependent.

16:05.820 --> 16:06.900
Igen equation.

16:08.230 --> 16:15.580
An important property of Schrodinger's equation is that it is linear differential equation is set to

16:15.580 --> 16:26.050
be linear when given to different allowed solutions and say I want MCI to also that some say one plus

16:26.410 --> 16:29.590
two is again and allow the solution.

16:30.520 --> 16:37.870
As an example, you might recall the superposition of two waves forming a new wave as discussed with

16:37.870 --> 16:39.470
the interference phenomenon.

16:41.290 --> 16:49.330
This means that also the sum of two solutions is, again, the solution to this differential equation

16:49.330 --> 16:53.800
or this one, this one, this or this to the to the Schrodinger equation.

16:53.830 --> 16:58.750
This means that the Schrodinger equation is a linear differential equation.

16:59.650 --> 17:07.630
This will be crucial later when we will discuss quantum superposition in principle and also the measurement

17:07.750 --> 17:11.140
measurement problem in a lecture later.

17:13.740 --> 17:22.440
The Hamiltonian operator also defines the time, evolution of the wavefunction from a time zero to a

17:22.680 --> 17:23.550
time T..

17:25.260 --> 17:35.070
In particular, if age is independent of times, the very right age without the time parameter, given

17:35.250 --> 17:45.140
a state size zero at time zero, we have the state vector at 10 00 at an initial time, T equals zero,

17:46.470 --> 17:48.840
the state of the quantum system.

17:50.090 --> 17:59.720
Head of society, at any subsequent time t is generated, Wiecek, it is in quantum mechanics, you

17:59.720 --> 18:08.900
say it's generated by the so-called unitary operator, which is this quantity given here and is expressed

18:08.900 --> 18:12.940
with the exponential unitary operator.

18:12.950 --> 18:18.320
You capital letter U equals E exponential.

18:19.430 --> 18:30.530
Minus I h t over h bar and using this quantity, applying this operator on to the.

18:33.300 --> 18:43.980
State initial, state vector, initial in time, you operating over a cat of site zero, this quantity

18:43.980 --> 18:44.430
here.

18:45.470 --> 18:54.800
Then you obtain the state of the system at a subsequent time, t that is the cat of society.

18:56.570 --> 19:06.710
So this quantity, this equation here tells me how BPCI within this initial state, besides zero, evolves,

19:07.310 --> 19:09.020
develops in time.

19:10.210 --> 19:12.680
And becomes BPCI of tea.

19:12.940 --> 19:22.780
And how do we do that, we just apply the evolution operator you upon the state vector site of zero

19:23.080 --> 19:24.160
at this time zero.

19:26.930 --> 19:34.250
Its main physical interpretation of all of this is that it is an operator, that evolution operator

19:34.250 --> 19:39.230
that does not describe an observable that is a measurement.

19:39.860 --> 19:42.320
The evolution operator is not an observable.

19:42.650 --> 19:43.610
It is something that.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.240
Involves the state function.

19:47.590 --> 19:51.350
In fact, it is the evolution in time of a quantum system.

19:51.370 --> 19:54.240
It gives us an evolution in time of a quantum system.

19:54.550 --> 20:00.550
It changes the face of the wave function or state vector, but not its length.

20:02.220 --> 20:02.660
At.

20:03.870 --> 20:13.440
Imagine a vector and you change the direction, not the length of this vector, this, so to speak,

20:13.440 --> 20:22.020
length conservation that you conserve the length of this state vector reflects nothing else, then the

20:22.020 --> 20:29.910
necessity to conserve, to conserve the sum of all the probabilities associated to the Afghan states

20:30.240 --> 20:32.570
before and after the state evolution.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.290
This case can be expressed using the.

20:38.550 --> 20:48.120
Equation that we used in a previous slide, remember this one where Roquette of BPCI, that is the sum

20:48.120 --> 20:51.480
of all the model, the square of the coefficients must give one.

20:53.100 --> 21:01.680
Then we can generalize this expression from and time independent from this time, independent expression

21:02.040 --> 21:04.940
to the time dependent expression.

21:04.950 --> 21:09.750
But the sum of all the probabilities must always be equal.

21:09.750 --> 21:19.160
One If in in our quantum system there is no interaction from the outside that destroys everything.

21:19.740 --> 21:27.390
But for an isolated quantum system that evolves in time, this expression must be conserved.

21:28.020 --> 21:35.020
Therefore, its name unitary operator because it transforms something.

21:35.040 --> 21:37.230
But unity is conserved.

21:38.680 --> 21:46.030
Moreover, note that if you is a unitary operator that avoids the quantum state forward in time, its

21:46.030 --> 22:00.580
complex conjugate, you star equal a the oil, a number power plus eye HD over each bar sends it backward

22:00.580 --> 22:04.060
in time by an interval to.

22:05.610 --> 22:13.350
Then it becomes obvious that applying first you start the complex conjugate and you consecutively.

22:14.430 --> 22:21.780
This means that it preserves the state, that is it is an equal formal definition of a unit unitary

22:22.140 --> 22:26.670
operator, it is that it satisfies the general relation.

22:27.180 --> 22:34.320
You start times, you equal one because you go forward in time, then you come back.

22:34.530 --> 22:36.720
And nothing has changed, of course.

22:37.220 --> 22:42.750
Again, this must give that this is the identity operator.

22:43.680 --> 22:52.950
It leaves everything identical with the one being a scholar, just a number one or more generally an

22:53.070 --> 22:54.200
identity operator.

22:54.210 --> 22:58.200
That leaves the things as as they are more.

22:58.590 --> 23:07.190
We will tell on this later because this concept of the unitary unitary operator, operator or unitary

23:07.200 --> 23:13.740
of evolution, more generally, it is a very important concept in quantum mechanics, as we will see

23:14.040 --> 23:22.980
this operator reappears throughout our journey and we will discuss its properties in different contexts

23:22.980 --> 23:23.430
again.

23:24.960 --> 23:32.940
For completeness, since we will make use of it when dealing with quantum decoherence, let us point

23:32.940 --> 23:40.830
out how once the Schrodinger equation has been solved and the Igan states with its Igen energies are

23:40.830 --> 23:47.360
known, it is possible to calculate the transition, so-called transition amplitudes.

23:47.640 --> 23:55.380
That is the probability that an atom transitions say, because of the scattering or absorption of a

23:55.380 --> 24:02.400
photon from an initial state capsid to a final state Khaddafi.

24:03.510 --> 24:11.850
Dirac's notation allows to determine the probability that this transition will take place as follows.

24:12.150 --> 24:15.750
Here you see the usual model, the square.

24:17.160 --> 24:25.260
And what is squared is the bracket of the state C two state fee.

24:26.280 --> 24:37.350
So we have an expression in direct annotation of what the probability is that a state that typically

24:37.350 --> 24:45.240
an atom or quantum system transitions from a state BPCI to a state five and.

24:46.180 --> 24:54.310
You express this with the intention of this way, for example, the probability that an atom in isolation

24:54.790 --> 25:03.430
spontaneously transitions from an energetic lower, I can state it e0 to a higher one.

25:03.610 --> 25:06.100
Each one is zero.

25:07.000 --> 25:18.700
Which implies that the bracket of E zero e one equals zero in this case, one speaks of or thought orthogonal

25:18.820 --> 25:28.360
state vectors because geometrically this is displayed as being the ideal state vectors perpendicular

25:28.360 --> 25:29.290
to each other.

25:29.570 --> 25:38.680
Yeah, that's, after all, the meaning of the Igen states and their display in a Cartesian.

25:41.050 --> 25:52.660
Space as multidimensional space where the axis have an orthogonal orthogonal orientation, and if you

25:52.660 --> 26:01.150
make the circle a product of orthogonal vectors, you have always zero, which in quantum mechanical

26:01.150 --> 26:06.170
terms means that the probability to transition from one state to the other is zero.

26:06.460 --> 26:12.520
And that's why the igan states, when we measure them always, always, always, many times there remain

26:12.550 --> 26:13.060
there.

26:13.810 --> 26:21.280
That's the real fundamental meaning of the igan states and orthogonality in quantum mechanics.

26:22.750 --> 26:31.600
However, for any quantum system which is subjected to an outside interaction, say, such as in a scattering

26:31.780 --> 26:40.420
or a measurement process, an atom receives a photon or something like that, the state vectors may

26:40.420 --> 26:41.830
no longer be orthogonal.

26:42.730 --> 26:52.840
And this equation acquires a non-zero value and represents the transition probability from one state

26:52.840 --> 26:53.780
to another.

26:54.940 --> 27:03.160
There is then a certain chance that due to this interaction or measurement, a state transition occurs

27:03.550 --> 27:09.400
in case of atoms eventually by emission or absorption of photons.

27:12.440 --> 27:16.680
This was just a brief introduction to the formalism of quantum mechanics.

27:16.700 --> 27:25.550
We will not go too much to we will not dwell too deep into this formal aspect of quantum mechanics.

27:25.580 --> 27:34.160
I wanted only to make a short, brief and a bit superficial overview of the subject, but it is necessary

27:34.160 --> 27:42.800
because here and there something will always pop up and it will be necessary to have at least an idea

27:42.800 --> 27:43.820
of what's about.
