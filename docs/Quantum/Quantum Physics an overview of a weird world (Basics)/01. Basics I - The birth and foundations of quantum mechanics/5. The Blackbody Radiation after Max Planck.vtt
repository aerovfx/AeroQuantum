Max Planck, the German physicist who solved the BlackBerry dilemma in nine or five, was then working

00:09.560 --> 00:11.600
at his dissertation thesis.

00:12.720 --> 00:20.100
He solved the problem by introducing two fundamental and revolutionary hypotheses into the description

00:20.100 --> 00:21.220
of the black body model.

00:22.140 --> 00:31.290
First of all, he proposed to replace the arbitrary energy value of each electromagnetic mode or harmonic

00:31.290 --> 00:35.900
oscillator with integer multiples of the first mode.

00:35.910 --> 00:43.260
Energy recall from the previous lecture, how standing waves can exist only at specific wavelength.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.380
That is only for specific frequencies.

00:47.370 --> 00:56.070
Not every kind of electro electromagnetic waves can be contained in a cavity in stationary mode, but

00:56.070 --> 00:59.840
only those which match the right frequencies.

01:01.440 --> 01:07.560
And if you go back to the graphics and the animations that they've shown you in the previous lecture,

01:07.740 --> 01:15.150
you will realize how the second mode has half the wavelength, which means twice the frequency of the

01:15.270 --> 01:16.070
first note.

01:17.370 --> 01:21.090
The third mode has one third of the wavelength.

01:21.420 --> 01:29.160
That is three times the frequency still of the first note and so on, which implies that in general,

01:29.460 --> 01:37.590
the frequency of the end smolt standing wave is eight times the frequency of the first mode.

01:39.210 --> 01:47.340
Plunk posited also that there is a direct, linear, linear relationship between these ends frequency

01:47.970 --> 01:58.530
and the end energy state of the ends, Mote expressed as the following formula shows with H being the

01:58.530 --> 02:07.020
Planck's constant and which which value is a very tiny number, six times six point six to six times

02:07.020 --> 02:09.750
ten to the power minus 34.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.940
Drool over helps or hurts in English.

02:14.940 --> 02:22.200
Joule is the energy unit in jail in July and as we already saw, Hertz is the frequency unit.

02:24.260 --> 02:31.490
It is a value, the Planck's constant is a value which is not predicted by any theory, but is just

02:31.490 --> 02:38.840
given by nature and must be measured as the mass of an electron or proton or the gravitational strength

02:38.840 --> 02:39.660
of a given mass.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.220
The gravitational constant, these are values that we don't.

02:44.470 --> 02:51.710
Obtained from our series, you must measure directly because they are as they are and who know?

02:51.790 --> 02:52.960
Nobody knows why.

02:54.970 --> 03:04.000
This little and simple relation, which connects the energy of an electromagnetic wave sending wave

03:04.000 --> 03:11.050
in the cavity with its oscillating frequency is extremely important in quantum physics.

03:13.090 --> 03:21.100
Moreover, note how this means also that there is a mode of minimum frequency that is, as we said,

03:21.250 --> 03:26.740
the first mode below which no other mode can exist with lower frequency.

03:28.000 --> 03:35.590
What therefore, this famous equation tells us also is that the electromagnetic field in the black body

03:35.590 --> 03:44.870
cavity must be composed by many molds which take energy values, such as it stands now two times H2O,

03:44.890 --> 03:53.980
three times H2O, etc., but cannot have any value in between, such as one point five H or two point

03:53.980 --> 03:55.960
seven, eight, etc..

03:57.190 --> 04:02.380
The electromagnetic moulds in the cavity must appear, therefore in energy steps of.

04:03.390 --> 04:04.050
Energy.

04:05.390 --> 04:13.820
Difference age, no, with no the frequency of the first mode, and which is given only by the distance,

04:14.030 --> 04:20.000
determined only by the distance and geometric structure of the cavity, and any value in between is

04:20.000 --> 04:21.230
not allowed to exist.

04:22.910 --> 04:30.140
Therefore, despite being the cavity filled with an astronomical number of moles, none of it can have

04:30.140 --> 04:36.830
an energy less than a minimum energy H2O and which is called the Ground State Energy.

04:38.040 --> 04:46.950
This is a typical aspect of quantum theory, energy appears in Quanta, and there does not exist a state

04:46.950 --> 04:48.180
of zero energy.

04:49.350 --> 04:56.880
Every quantum system, such as, for example, an atom, has a non-zero ground state energy, as we

04:56.880 --> 04:59.580
will see also in more detail later.

05:01.360 --> 05:10.150
It may be said also that modern textbooks associate the end modes in the cavity, also to end particles

05:10.150 --> 05:16.780
of electromagnetic energy eight times now called photons.

05:17.770 --> 05:24.640
Historically, however, as we shall see, this concept and the word photon itself was introduced only

05:24.640 --> 05:28.180
later by Einstein describing the photoelectric effect.

05:29.550 --> 05:37.500
Actually, at this point, until now, there is no need to introduce light particles, at least not

05:37.500 --> 05:38.250
at this stage.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.540
Then the idea to replace continues with discrete energy modes was not entirely a novel idea.

05:48.230 --> 05:55.280
It was already well known that atoms absorb and emit light only with specific wavelengths and not throughout

05:55.280 --> 05:56.350
a continuous spectrum.

05:57.530 --> 05:59.770
The spectral analysis of elements.

05:59.840 --> 06:10.820
In fact, dates back to 1861 when Gustaaf about yourself and about a billion Bonson realized how every

06:10.820 --> 06:15.650
element emits and absorbs light only at very specific wavelengths.

06:16.640 --> 06:23.270
Each element has its own spectrum, which is like characteristic optical fingerprint.

06:24.870 --> 06:32.970
More generally, every element or substance, every type of atom or molecule resonate only at certain

06:32.970 --> 06:37.000
frequencies and which can be visualized with their spectral lines.

06:38.190 --> 06:44.730
For example, here you can see the emission spectrum of hydrogen and mercury atoms.

06:45.930 --> 06:53.400
When the hydrogen atom is excited, say, buy an electric discharge or buy heat, it really emits the

06:53.400 --> 06:58.220
absorbed energy only at certain colors of the visible spectrum.

06:58.380 --> 06:59.820
It's shown with one line.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.300
There is no continuity in the emission.

07:03.450 --> 07:08.940
The same thing happens with Mercury, which, however, shows to have several more emission spectral

07:08.940 --> 07:18.540
lines than hydrogen, indicating the fact that mercury in the mercury atom must be much more complicated

07:18.660 --> 07:20.070
and complex than hydrogen.

07:21.150 --> 07:28.440
Therefore, the analogy between these discrete spectral lines and energy states of atoms withstanding

07:28.440 --> 07:37.380
waves which exist only for a specific frequency and wavelength inside a cavity is not too far fetched.

07:38.970 --> 07:46.170
But a clear understanding how these spectra come into being had to wait at least another another 70

07:46.170 --> 07:50.340
years after cursus and balloons and observations.

07:52.160 --> 07:59.300
The second hypothesis Plank introduced was that let's consider not all the modes as being equally probable.

08:00.500 --> 08:07.250
This wasn't a new idea either, since it was already considered by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann

08:07.880 --> 08:14.180
and who is well known for his contribution in the field of statistical physics, according to Bozman,

08:14.330 --> 08:20.930
for blackbirding thermal equilibrium, which again means at constant temperature, the probability to

08:20.930 --> 08:26.450
find a mode with a certain energy will be smaller.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.880
The smaller, the greater this energy is.

08:29.990 --> 08:36.710
According to this hypothesis, which postpunk described in a mathematical precise manner, there are

08:36.710 --> 08:41.210
much more modes with lower energy than those with higher ones.

08:42.660 --> 08:48.560
The energy of the cavity is therefore no longer distributed equally, equally on all modes.

08:49.040 --> 08:54.380
But according to a law which is called the Boltzmann distribution law.

08:56.050 --> 09:04.060
However, the decisive the decisive difference between the idea of Plank and that of Boltzmann was that

09:04.060 --> 09:13.050
the former introduced the hypothesis which replaced the arbitrary energy values e with the above disco

09:13.240 --> 09:23.350
described quantized once e and the probability to find modes with energy n plus one is smaller than

09:23.350 --> 09:25.600
finding those with energy n.

09:26.990 --> 09:35.510
Also in this model for an increasing number in the energy of the mold increases too, but the probability

09:35.720 --> 09:40.710
to find such molds becomes also increasing increasingly smaller.

09:43.190 --> 09:49.180
At this point, it becomes also clear why there could be no ultraviolet catastrophe.

09:49.730 --> 09:56.660
The probability to find modes of increasing high energy after a certain point, after a certain GNR

09:57.590 --> 10:04.490
becomes so vanishingly small that for any practical purpose we can consider it to be zero.

10:05.660 --> 10:09.030
Emote with increasing N becomes increasingly improbable.

10:09.050 --> 10:16.640
And by the way, with an exponential law, Muslem one, I must say that is the probability to find Mode's

10:16.880 --> 10:21.680
with higher energy decreases increasingly fast.

10:21.680 --> 10:30.530
If you let me put it in this way, which also entails that if we add up all the energies of the infinite

10:30.530 --> 10:39.320
number of modes, the sum, even if it has an infinite number of term terms, will turn out nevertheless

10:39.620 --> 10:42.860
to be infinite amount of energy.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.740
It is what in mathematics one calls a convergent, a convergent Sirius.

10:49.670 --> 10:56.390
Or, to put it another way, an infinitely high energy mode has an infinitely small probability to exist.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.880
That is, there could not.

10:59.830 --> 11:07.360
Exist any mode with infinite energy and therefore the total energy in the cavity stays infinite.

11:08.440 --> 11:12.050
Nothing explodes in an infinite blast of energy.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.020
And finally, the universe is safe.

11:18.510 --> 11:25.860
Moreover, Plank's great achievement was not only that to avoid catastrophic infinities in the calculations,

11:26.370 --> 11:33.570
but also to be able to furnish a precise formula which correctly describes the black body radiation

11:33.570 --> 11:41.490
we observe in nature, he made again all the calculations that Boltzmann already did, but with the

11:41.490 --> 11:47.070
decisive modifications that replaced the continuous energy function with a quantized one.

11:48.440 --> 11:56.300
By doing so, he obtained an expression which nicely describes the energy density of the electron electromagnetic

11:56.300 --> 12:04.130
radiation spectrum of a black body with temperature T and any given wavelength lambda or frequency no.

12:05.120 --> 12:09.830
The famous Planck's formula for the black body radiation.

12:11.250 --> 12:18.480
In this graph on the horizontal axis, the axis, the wave length of a body is given by the vertical

12:18.480 --> 12:25.050
axis, the ordinate represents the intensity of the electromagnetic electromagnetic radiation it emits

12:25.770 --> 12:27.210
in arbitrary units.

12:27.570 --> 12:31.540
The units of the intensity would be a bit cumbersome to explain you.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.300
And but this is not really relevant.

12:34.680 --> 12:38.040
Just imagine a higher intensity going upwards.

12:39.650 --> 12:47.180
Each curve on the graph represents a body with a specific temperature, the black the black curve represents

12:47.180 --> 12:53.720
that of a body for 5000 degrees Kelvin and is calculated with the classical physics.

12:54.350 --> 13:01.180
As one can see the divergence quickly for smaller wavelengths, it leads to the ultraviolet catastrophe.

13:01.430 --> 13:12.860
It is the formula of ryley genes, whereas the blue curve represents the radiation of the body was the

13:12.860 --> 13:21.050
same temperature, but this time calculated by taking into account that energy is absorbed in quanta

13:21.620 --> 13:29.570
and into oscillation modes with energy states of different probabilities, according to Blancs idea.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.230
You can see that apart from concealing the divergence.

13:34.520 --> 13:43.010
It has a maximum peak at about zero point six micrometers, it's 600 nanometres, which corresponds

13:43.670 --> 13:45.680
more or less to the yellow color.

13:46.490 --> 13:53.000
In fact, the surface of our sun has a temperature of about five thousand two hundred Celsius and as

13:53.000 --> 13:56.080
well known, appears to have a yellow color.

13:57.290 --> 14:04.670
A couple of other curves for the radiation of what is at 4000 Kelvin and 3000 Kelvin are shown also

14:04.670 --> 14:05.240
as well.

14:06.530 --> 14:13.190
Note how the colder the body, the more shifted towards large wavelengths is its maximum.

14:14.340 --> 14:21.640
Therefore, hot bodies tend to radiate in higher frequencies, the main frequency domains, that is,

14:21.660 --> 14:29.610
they tend to radiate more blue or become eventually even ultraviolet, whereas cold bodies tend more

14:29.610 --> 14:32.040
towards the visible or infrared light.

14:33.410 --> 14:40.400
If a body becomes white, this only means that it has become so hot that it radiates strongly in any

14:40.400 --> 14:48.530
or several wavelengths because as well known, when all colors are mixed up together, the resultant

14:48.530 --> 14:50.050
color appears as white.

14:50.420 --> 14:57.410
That is the reason, which, by the way, makes it also clear how, strictly speaking, white isn't

14:57.620 --> 15:01.640
physically, physically a color as black isn't either.

15:03.510 --> 15:11.340
Planck's theory solves the problem of the ultraviolet catastrophe, and this was also confirmed experimentally,

15:11.670 --> 15:16.480
measuring the radiation emitted by different bodies at different temperature.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.760
For those interested in the mathematical description here, I add only for completeness.

15:22.770 --> 15:31.110
Also, the formulas which describe the Riley Riley genes curve and which leads to the ultraviolet catastrophe

15:31.110 --> 15:37.670
and the Planck formula, which turns out to be without divergences and is the correct one.

15:38.670 --> 15:47.520
You is the energy density like the Boltzmann constant, a universal constant that appears in thermodynamics?

15:48.490 --> 15:57.010
C is the speed of light and obviously age no end to the blanks constant the frequency of the electromagnetic

15:57.010 --> 16:00.160
radiation and the temperature, respectively.

16:01.360 --> 16:07.570
I added this just only for illustrative purposes for those who might be curious about it.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.490
If you do not understand these formulas, it does not matter.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.540
We won't need it anyway.

16:14.310 --> 16:22.230
So one interesting fact is that since the spectrographs do not depend from the type of material, but

16:22.230 --> 16:29.790
only from its temperature, which gave astronomers also a great tool for measuring the temperature of

16:29.790 --> 16:38.870
distant stars, for example, there is no need to reach physically a star light years away with a thermometer,

16:39.300 --> 16:40.720
a physical thermometer.

16:41.250 --> 16:46.860
We have just to measure its spectral curve and we will know its temperature just by fitting it with

16:46.860 --> 16:47.850
a Blancs equation.

16:49.830 --> 16:57.450
For instance, this graph shows the spectrum of the solar radiation, it does not appear so smooth as

16:57.450 --> 17:04.210
the preceding graph, but this is only because it is measured through the Earth's atmosphere.

17:05.040 --> 17:11.700
We can see how the solar spectrum is absorbed by the molecules that make up the atmosphere itself and

17:11.700 --> 17:15.450
produce some sort of pick holes in the spectrum.

17:18.470 --> 17:24.470
Why the theoretical black body radiation fits well, the measured curve of the sun at the top of the

17:24.470 --> 17:26.730
atmosphere at the sea level.

17:26.780 --> 17:35.780
There are these holes, so-called absorb absorption bands, corresponding to several kinds of molecules,

17:36.140 --> 17:44.410
typically water or carbon dioxide molecules, with this kind of observations and experimental analysis,

17:44.570 --> 17:51.380
also the determination of the chemical composition of stars or other distant objects that cannot be

17:51.740 --> 17:56.360
analyzed directly on place became possible.

17:59.070 --> 18:06.750
The black body radiation was also confirmed much later about the end of the 1960s on a cosmic scale.

18:07.500 --> 18:15.990
In fact, we can conceive also the whole universe as a single body or if you prefer, a cavity, which

18:15.990 --> 18:23.250
country contains a sea of electromagnetic radiation and matter like every every other object to.

18:24.870 --> 18:31.590
According to the Big Bang Theory, the universe once came into being at extremely high temperatures

18:31.590 --> 18:40.000
by a huge explosion about thirteen point seven billions of years ago, expanded and cooled down with

18:40.020 --> 18:41.520
a thought with time passing by.

18:42.780 --> 18:49.350
But as a whole, it can still be considered as a body with some temperature, which must contain a radiation,

18:49.920 --> 18:57.480
just like in the case of the cavity, the so-called cosmic background radiation into which we can associate

18:57.480 --> 18:58.260
a temperature.

18:59.980 --> 19:09.790
So the question arises naturally, if that the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation fallout follows

19:09.790 --> 19:13.270
also the bell shaped Planck spectrum.

19:14.120 --> 19:14.640
Does it?

19:15.080 --> 19:23.900
Well, the answer came by measuring radio waves with radio telescopes from the ground and later confirmed

19:24.020 --> 19:31.520
with much more precise measurements on board of satellites free from the atmospheric atmospheric absorption.

19:32.870 --> 19:33.680
The result?

19:35.010 --> 19:36.710
The results are visible here.

19:37.280 --> 19:44.420
And you can see the cosmic microwave background spectrum measured by the Colbie satellite.

19:46.220 --> 19:51.890
You can see how there is an almost perfect match between the measured, measured flux coming from the

19:51.890 --> 20:00.920
universe and the calculated and that calculated for a body with two point seven Kelvin temperature where

20:00.920 --> 20:06.160
the units here are in frequency, it is about wavelengths percent matter.

20:06.590 --> 20:14.690
If one knows how many times a wavelength fits into a centimeter and knows the speed of light, one can

20:14.690 --> 20:23.210
infer from that the frequency and the intensity is given in mega Jansky past Erdogan that is about 10

20:23.210 --> 20:25.090
to the power minus 20.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.670
That for a solid angle unit.

20:29.120 --> 20:35.930
OK, just on the up side there you have the frequency and the ordinate, the vertical axis.

20:36.150 --> 20:38.150
Just imagine an intensity.

20:39.590 --> 20:41.780
So the universe is a very cold place.

20:42.830 --> 20:51.140
Because it's it has a temperature of about two point seven Kelvin, which is about almost more than

20:51.140 --> 21:00.820
270 degrees Celsius under below zero, but still it is not at absolute zero temperature.

21:03.050 --> 21:09.230
Just for curiosity, here you see the map of the overall structure of the universe inferred from the

21:09.230 --> 21:16.140
cosmic background radiation and more precisely from its fluctuations, from the ideal Planck spectrum.

21:17.180 --> 21:24.650
These ripples and tiny inner modernities represent the small departure from perfect homogeneity of matter

21:24.770 --> 21:25.370
and energy.

21:25.380 --> 21:33.590
These distributions, these observations confirmed Planck theory, which can be considered one of the

21:33.590 --> 21:37.500
greatest triumphs of the physics of the last century.

21:38.540 --> 21:44.690
It makes also clear how Boltzmann was incredibly near to the solution.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.540
What would he have replaced?

21:47.540 --> 21:51.440
The continuous energy function with a discrete, valued one?

21:51.620 --> 21:58.460
In his own mathematical theory, all Planck's merits and fame would have been his instead.

21:59.680 --> 22:07.840
This shows also how sometimes very simple but subtle intuitions could change the history of science,

22:08.350 --> 22:10.960
leading to a great paradigm shift.

22:13.650 --> 22:19.740
So the most important message of this lecture on the black body radiation and that we will have to keep

22:19.740 --> 22:26.790
in mind throughout is that we must surrender to the idea and fact that according to quantum mechanics

22:26.790 --> 22:35.190
energy and we will see later also other physical quantities as well, seems to come up in form of these

22:35.850 --> 22:39.260
chunks and packets or quanta of energy.

22:40.200 --> 22:45.960
Energy is absorbed or emitted only in discrete quantum amounts.

22:47.070 --> 22:56.910
By Metro Metro, it absorbs and emits it in form of quantum energy is therefore a quantized physical

22:56.910 --> 22:57.420
quantity.

22:57.420 --> 23:05.400
One use to say this fact became the conceptual foundation on which all modern quantum physics is based

23:05.400 --> 23:07.670
on, and that will follow us.

23:07.680 --> 23:15.390
And in all the coming lectures to that is, after all, where the name quantum mechanics or quantum

23:15.390 --> 23:17.490
physics or quantum theory comes from.

23:18.950 --> 23:23.930
With Plank's achievement, quantum physics was finally born.
