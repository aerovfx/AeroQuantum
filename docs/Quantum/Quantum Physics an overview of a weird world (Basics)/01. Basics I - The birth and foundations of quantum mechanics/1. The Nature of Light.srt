00:00.990 --> 00:07.550
Since the times of ancient Greece, natural philosophers inquired into the physical nature of light,

00:08.490 --> 00:09.980
what really is light?

00:10.680 --> 00:11.830
Where does it come from?

00:11.850 --> 00:13.620
How is it emitted and absorbed?

00:15.180 --> 00:24.270
And one of the most challenging sets set of questions that has kept many bright minds up to nowadays

00:25.140 --> 00:28.550
was the question, what is it like made of?

00:28.830 --> 00:35.190
Is it made of light particles as water waves are made of H2O molecules or is it the wave?

00:35.760 --> 00:38.750
If it is a wave, then a wave made of what?

00:39.030 --> 00:40.950
And traveling through what?

00:41.610 --> 00:47.130
Or is it both a wave and a particle or is it something entirely different?

00:48.310 --> 00:51.590
Many questions with almost no answer.

00:53.550 --> 01:01.710
I Stotler declared that the essence of light is white color and colors are made up of a mixture of lightness

01:01.710 --> 01:02.610
and darkness.

01:04.230 --> 01:08.190
Well, considering this in retrospect, it was not a bad guess.

01:08.490 --> 01:18.330
Interestingly, the idea of light being made of a mixture of lightness and darkness was taken up much

01:18.330 --> 01:27.510
later by Johann Wolfgang Frogurt, a German writer, poet and natural philosopher living in the 18th

01:27.510 --> 01:28.140
century.

01:28.890 --> 01:34.410
And Gerta because Guta constructed a theory of light that indeed works.

01:35.640 --> 01:41.940
Most physicists don't know that because they probably would never have heard of that, because nowadays

01:41.940 --> 01:43.860
you don't learn about these things.

01:44.700 --> 01:55.410
But in fact, it's interesting really that the three colors of Guta is in fact a theory that explains,

01:55.410 --> 01:58.510
well, the phenomenon of colors.

01:59.190 --> 02:07.500
In fact, he conceived light as not being something fundamental, but something that emerges from a

02:07.740 --> 02:11.610
so-called primordial phenomenon from the German word.

02:11.610 --> 02:14.640
Philomene means primordial phenomenon.

02:14.640 --> 02:21.570
And this primordial phenomenon can be observed, according to Gerta, at the boundary between light

02:21.570 --> 02:22.470
and darkness.

02:23.190 --> 02:31.590
In this conception, cholera's never arise by light alone, but they arise as a consequence of a dark

02:31.590 --> 02:38.520
and light or if you wish, or a black and white contrast at boundaries, edges, slits.

02:39.850 --> 02:45.130
A quite interesting theory in its own little now this could not be disproven and it is in principle

02:45.130 --> 02:45.790
still valid.

02:46.960 --> 02:53.890
I would recommend everyone interested in the history and philosophy of science to take a look at KURTAS

02:53.890 --> 02:54.400
approach.

02:54.580 --> 02:56.990
It might still have something to teach us.

02:57.610 --> 03:05.620
It explains light, darkness and colors from a qualitative standpoint and in some respect could be considered

03:05.620 --> 03:10.380
as a complementary understanding to the modern physical quantitative approach.

03:11.810 --> 03:20.630
However good the theory of callers being, a purely qualitative theory can't make quantitative predictions

03:20.630 --> 03:25.490
as a modern quantitative science, as physics needs to be able to do.

03:27.500 --> 03:35.690
It was a contemporary of Gerta Sir Isaac Newton, and that everyone, everybody knows, or at least

03:35.960 --> 03:43.670
should have heard about the famous English physicist, mathematician and astronomer better known for

03:43.670 --> 03:51.860
his law of universal gravitation, who was able to separate white light into its colored components

03:51.860 --> 03:53.630
using an optical prism.

03:55.100 --> 03:58.940
More relevant for our purpose was Newton's light particle theory.

03:59.810 --> 04:05.250
Accordingly, light was seen as a flux of colored particles at the time.

04:05.300 --> 04:08.290
This was not much more than speculation.

04:08.630 --> 04:13.130
It was not a real understanding coming from a conclusive investigation.

04:15.130 --> 04:22.660
In fact, Christian Harrigan's, a Dutch mathematician, physicist and also astronomer, did not share

04:22.660 --> 04:26.970
Newton's idea and stated the contrary that light is a wave.

04:28.370 --> 04:34.370
For a long time, there was a heated debate regarding who theory was correct.

04:34.910 --> 04:41.900
In fact, it was difficult to imagine light as made of particles and at the same time as being a wave,

04:42.860 --> 04:45.310
one or the other theory must be true.

04:46.040 --> 04:53.320
Both theories being true at the same time was considered to be a logical impossibility.

04:55.710 --> 05:05.360
In 18 03, a groundbreaking discovery settled the issue for at least a century, Tomas Young, an English

05:05.480 --> 05:12.800
physician, performed a revolutionary experiment, the well-known double slit experiment.

05:15.320 --> 05:21.890
He first showed that when light is emitted by a point source and is directed through a card with two

05:21.890 --> 05:32.420
tiny nearby nearby pinholes, a colored interference pattern appears on a screen positioned at an appropriate

05:32.600 --> 05:35.990
distance on the other side of the card with the pinholes.

05:37.220 --> 05:41.450
Later, the same experiment was performed with two slits instead of pinholes.

05:43.250 --> 05:52.460
How waves add or subtract at each other resulting in an interference pattern was something that already

05:53.000 --> 06:01.670
was well known and accurately studied with mechanical ways, typically oscillating pendulums or water

06:01.670 --> 06:02.150
waves.

06:04.070 --> 06:12.740
Since light exhibits exactly the same characteristic behavior in the double slit experiment, this seemed

06:13.130 --> 06:24.140
to finally prove the wave theory of light versus against the particle interpretation beyond any reasonable

06:24.380 --> 06:24.910
doubt.

06:27.260 --> 06:35.600
Then further insights on the nature of light came from the works of James Clark Maxwell, a Scottish

06:35.600 --> 06:43.730
theoretical physicist who predicted the access, the existence of electromagnetic waves, Maxwell equations,

06:43.850 --> 06:49.160
which are the mathematical foundation for modern electromagnetism.

06:51.270 --> 06:58.790
I set off four elegant equations that are very general Anholt for electromagnetic waves in general,

07:00.150 --> 07:08.670
the connection between light and electricity as magnetic phenomenon became clear as an obvious consequence

07:08.670 --> 07:15.210
of the fact that it was shown how electric and magnetic fields propagate with exactly the same speed

07:15.510 --> 07:16.160
of light.

07:17.820 --> 07:21.650
So the issue seemed to have been settled once and for all.

07:22.260 --> 07:30.380
Lt must be an oscillating electric and magnetic field propagating throughout space like a wave.

07:31.530 --> 07:40.290
This wisdom was accepted as an almost final and undeniable fact for a lot of time.

07:43.590 --> 07:45.750
Only one problem remained open.

07:46.830 --> 07:55.020
What is the medium through which light is supposed to travel, water waves, sound waves or material

07:55.020 --> 08:03.450
waves you suspect respectively, water, air or a solid body as a support through which they can propagate

08:04.530 --> 08:11.480
without water or air or metal in some form, there could be no transmission of waves at all.

08:12.470 --> 08:12.920
That's.

08:13.890 --> 08:22.710
Almost intuitive, however, since light can travel also through empty space, this led naturally to

08:22.710 --> 08:32.790
the question of empty space is made of some subtle yet unknown so-called nefarious ether that could

08:32.790 --> 08:36.800
function as a medium for electromagnetic waves.

08:37.260 --> 08:38.500
Also, the.

08:40.700 --> 08:50.240
These ruminations kept the young Albert Einstein busy while he was working in a Swiss patent office

08:50.240 --> 08:54.050
and led him to his famous theory of relativity.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.240
He simply posed that there is no ether at all.

08:59.310 --> 09:05.040
Without even knowing that this was already shown experimentally at this time at the time, Andrew,

09:05.040 --> 09:12.180
from that the conclusions that made him world famous, the theory of special relativity.

09:14.120 --> 09:20.900
The idea that empty space is not made of some immaterial substance that offers light a transmission

09:20.900 --> 09:31.040
medium holds until today and does no longer cause much debate, even if it's a bit and an anti intuitive,

09:31.040 --> 09:39.170
I would say, whereas as we shall see, our image of light being a wave and not a flux of particles

09:39.830 --> 09:48.500
will turn out to be in need of much further and deeper clarification and analysis before continuing

09:48.530 --> 09:51.970
in our historical analysis of the development of the nature of light.

09:51.980 --> 10:00.560
It is necessary now to introduce an interlude that sets the conceptual foundations we will need throughout

10:00.830 --> 10:01.940
this course.

10:03.140 --> 10:10.010
Nothing can be said in quantum physics if we do not have a clear and rigorous understanding of how waves

10:10.010 --> 10:14.930
and their characteristic interference phenomena are described in physics.
