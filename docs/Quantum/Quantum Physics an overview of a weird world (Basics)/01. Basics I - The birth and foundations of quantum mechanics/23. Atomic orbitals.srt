00:00.900 --> 00:06.930
Now that we have seen a bit what the Schrodinger equation is about, let us briefly take a quick look

00:06.930 --> 00:09.260
at its application to the real world.

00:09.930 --> 00:16.410
In fact, the Schrodinger igan equation allows for the calculation of the energy spectra of atoms,

00:17.640 --> 00:27.810
the potential energy we of X of the electrons around the nucleus depends on the number of protons that

00:28.380 --> 00:30.590
this nuclear nucleus contains.

00:31.950 --> 00:39.420
If one sets the particular boundary condition on the structure of this potential for, for instance,

00:39.960 --> 00:49.110
that is spherical and that it decreases according to an inverse law and that the wavefunction must be

00:49.110 --> 00:55.560
continuous, the Schrodinger equation becomes a solvable second order differential equation.

00:55.830 --> 01:04.140
Which solution will furnish the energy states and the probability amplitude psi of X to find the particle

01:04.230 --> 01:08.250
somewhere around the atomic nucleus?

01:09.910 --> 01:16.960
But that is what we have always to keep in mind, this is only a this has been.

01:18.960 --> 01:27.540
Must be intended only in a probabilistic sense, the igan equation formalism with its operators, eigenvectors

01:27.540 --> 01:34.260
and aying values is a mathematical description of the probability to find a particle in a specific position

01:34.260 --> 01:41.610
or state more generally with some specific momentum and some discrete or continuous energy states and

01:41.610 --> 01:42.060
so on.

01:42.960 --> 01:51.720
There's no such thing as in the balls atom or in classical physics as particles flying around a nucleus.

01:52.410 --> 02:01.320
There are no particles at all, but only the probability density function wrapped in some form or another

02:01.320 --> 02:04.450
around the center, the nucleus of an atom.

02:05.190 --> 02:12.900
In the case of the simplest possible atom, only an electron which is immersed into the potential field

02:12.900 --> 02:16.050
of a proton that is the hydrogen atom.

02:17.340 --> 02:24.600
Will we obtain for the energy ground state away function which describes a simple, simple probability

02:24.600 --> 02:34.440
density, just a spherical probability density distribution centred around one proton, no nucleus,

02:34.440 --> 02:37.080
no electron is visible as a particle.

02:37.410 --> 02:43.250
What this represents is the probability density to find the hydrogen atoms electron.

02:43.800 --> 02:52.080
It is just a graphical but quite effective representation of so-called atomic orbitals.

02:53.190 --> 02:59.250
Orbitals are the squared models of the way function obtained from Schrodinger's equation and the graphical

02:59.250 --> 03:05.940
representation of which highlights the statistical probabilities probabilistic nature of the quantum

03:05.940 --> 03:06.330
world.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.940
You just show it with a picture.

03:09.480 --> 03:18.270
The more intensely shaded regions here represent higher probability to find the electron in some just

03:18.270 --> 03:25.790
that place, while when the shading is less intense, one represents this.

03:26.360 --> 03:32.370
This represents simply a low probability density, low probability to find the electron.

03:32.370 --> 03:41.670
Just in that place, we get some sort of cloudy and fuzzy sphere, the so-called electron cloud or electron

03:41.670 --> 03:48.240
electron configuration, which has no longer anything left of the clear, well-defined, deterministic

03:48.240 --> 03:51.630
and precise representation of classical mechanics.

03:52.920 --> 03:59.400
However, this figure depicts the hydrogen atom only in its ground state, energy, ground, state.

03:59.580 --> 04:09.120
As we know, atoms are capable to absorb in a quantized manner quanta of energy and acquire other energy

04:09.120 --> 04:10.230
discrete levels.

04:11.700 --> 04:17.880
If an atom absorbs a photon, the electron cloud will acquire a different configuration.

04:18.510 --> 04:25.740
That is a different wavefunction with another probability distribution which will describe the excited

04:25.740 --> 04:26.130
atom.

04:27.760 --> 04:34.870
You will certainly recall how we used the one dimensional standing wave for the hydrogen atom in both

04:34.870 --> 04:42.820
atomic model, where we used to describe the electrons orbit no longer with a particle travelling in

04:42.820 --> 04:49.350
precise and well-defined path, but as a travelling wave around the atomic nucleus.

04:49.360 --> 04:57.550
That is a probability wave which wavelength is given by the liberal relation, and that could be displaced

04:57.550 --> 05:07.750
only at discrete distances from the center of the atomic nucleus to its energy levels according to its

05:07.750 --> 05:13.390
energy levels, because otherwise it cannot build up a standing wave with constructive interference.

05:15.220 --> 05:21.970
This idea can be generalized and extended to a circular circular two-dimensional standing with which

05:21.970 --> 05:26.100
we could visualise here with a sort of vibrating membrane.

05:27.100 --> 05:34.000
There are only specific vibration frequencies that are allowed in order to produce a standing wave that

05:34.000 --> 05:38.550
does not destruct itself due to destructive interference.

05:38.890 --> 05:45.070
But that has just that specific correct frequency that the back and forth reflect.

05:45.070 --> 05:48.020
The waves overlap onto each others.

05:48.220 --> 05:55.420
So to build up a constructive interference, stable, two dimensional standing wave, as in this case

05:55.420 --> 06:03.550
here, there are two quantum quantum numbers now because there could be two frequencies, one vibration

06:03.550 --> 06:11.350
along one dimension, say, the X direction and the other vibration along the other spatial dimension,

06:11.350 --> 06:13.350
say the Y direction.

06:14.290 --> 06:22.300
Therefore, one classifies all the two-dimensional standing waves with a set of two numbers zero one

06:22.300 --> 06:24.640
one one, two, one and so on.

06:25.270 --> 06:32.740
The same thing does the equation for a spherical, three dimensional potential here for completeness.

06:32.740 --> 06:38.410
The hydrogen atom orbital in its ground state, which corresponds to no vibration standing probability

06:38.410 --> 06:38.860
wave.

06:39.250 --> 06:47.320
It is just a spherical distribution has been shown again, whereas these pictures show several atomic

06:47.320 --> 06:51.700
orbital examples for higher energy levels of the hydrogen atom.

06:53.350 --> 06:59.500
Well, now, since since it is difficult to visualize the internal distribution of the three dimensional

06:59.500 --> 07:00.460
standing wave.

07:01.120 --> 07:08.780
These are two dimensional sections, slice slices of the three dimensional probability distribution.

07:09.100 --> 07:13.290
So you must imagine just cut it a section of it.

07:13.810 --> 07:20.320
It is what we get when we cut the atom along as light that goes through its central nucleus, so to

07:20.320 --> 07:20.730
speak.

07:21.640 --> 07:27.880
Each state defines the form and structure of the orbital and the slice.

07:29.530 --> 07:35.290
They are three dimensional standing waves, however, the kind of three dimensional analogue of the

07:35.290 --> 07:43.090
two dimensional or one dimensional circular standing waves or that we saw also for the standing wave

07:43.090 --> 07:47.470
in a box, if you recall, when we considered to explain the black body radiation.

07:48.700 --> 07:54.490
The difference, however, is that an atom does not have a solid confining boundary.

07:55.320 --> 08:05.220
As to the walls of a box or we imagine a billiard ball, but is mostly the limited by its nuclear no

08:05.430 --> 08:07.380
nuclear electric potential.

08:08.640 --> 08:15.630
And since we are a three dimensional space, the atoms electrons configuration can be described by three

08:15.630 --> 08:16.950
atomic quantum numbers.

08:17.820 --> 08:24.000
The first is the principle quantum number 10, which represents the energy level of the atom.

08:24.570 --> 08:32.020
It is that we already encountered in the BARATTA model with Circler electronic orbits.

08:33.240 --> 08:41.520
The second is the angular or at the quantum number labeled L. which characterizes the total angular

08:41.520 --> 08:48.090
momentum of the electron and specifies the shape of the orbital in that specific energy level.

08:48.140 --> 08:56.640
And this is the additional quantum number that emerges when one considers Sommerfeld some of sommerfeld

08:56.640 --> 09:01.230
extension from circler to elliptical electron electronic orbits.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.770
If you recall, we already saw this.

09:05.400 --> 09:13.200
Whereas the third quantum number, the so-called magnetic momentum quantum number, no Lebert M describes

09:13.260 --> 09:22.500
the orientation, the orientation of the orbital in energy state and an angular momentum l along a specified

09:22.500 --> 09:23.220
direction.

09:24.430 --> 09:31.020
From this mathematical quantization procedure we have described above and apply, applying a former

09:31.030 --> 09:35.740
description no longer in Cartesian coordinates but in spherical coordinates.

09:36.490 --> 09:43.480
It is possible to show how all these three numbers arise naturally and describe the different states

09:43.480 --> 09:50.950
of an atom and nice probability density cloud is associated with every combination of these quantum

09:50.950 --> 09:51.520
numbers.

09:52.870 --> 09:55.900
Atomic physics is much more complicated than that.

09:56.890 --> 10:02.890
This should be regarded, regarded only as an intuitive introduction, and we will not go deeper into

10:02.890 --> 10:03.220
this.

10:03.880 --> 10:10.150
It would require a much more rigorous and lengthy mathematical physical description which goes beyond

10:10.150 --> 10:11.490
the aims of this course.

10:12.490 --> 10:20.110
What you must, however, keep in mind is that what you are seeing here are probability distributions,

10:20.800 --> 10:26.440
another decisive difference to the black body cavity where the standing waves are considered, where

10:26.470 --> 10:27.820
electromagnetic waves.

10:28.870 --> 10:35.500
This means that if we would try to detect the position of an electron inside these orbitals, the wave

10:35.500 --> 10:39.810
function would collapse instantly at the act of measurement to a point particle.

10:40.840 --> 10:48.640
But before that, in quantum theory, we must conceive the system and is not made of particles.

10:48.640 --> 10:56.890
But as a single whole entity described by a fuzzy electron cloud represented by the orbitals.

10:58.360 --> 11:05.740
It is like in the case of the double slit experiment before the photon hitting the screen, we must

11:05.740 --> 11:11.730
conceive of a wave describing the photon at the instant of interaction.

11:11.980 --> 11:14.500
It collapses to a point on the screen.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.640
Not only at that instant, not before.

11:18.730 --> 11:22.850
Here we have the same situation before any attempt to measure something.

11:23.170 --> 11:29.470
It makes no sense to say that the electron has a specific position around the nucleus or momentum,

11:29.740 --> 11:36.390
but only that we have a certain probability to find it there with some certain probability to have a

11:36.910 --> 11:37.990
specific momentum.

11:38.590 --> 11:47.170
High lightning with this, the purely wavy and probabilistic nature of the quantum world, these sorts

11:47.170 --> 11:53.080
of calculations which all use this mathematical, mathematical formalism, the Schrodinger's equation

11:53.080 --> 12:00.810
and Dirac's notation can, of course, be applied to much more complex atoms than the hydrogen case

12:00.820 --> 12:04.350
and also to atomic nuclei and more like molecules.

12:05.260 --> 12:12.160
It is almost impossible to visualize the internal structure of a three dimensional orbital for a complex

12:12.160 --> 12:16.300
system like a molecule which has many electrons.

12:17.020 --> 12:25.180
However, here you can get at least a glimpse of how the outer and inner electron configuration looks

12:25.180 --> 12:29.200
like for carbon dioxide dioxide molecule.

12:30.130 --> 12:33.850
And the lower image is that of the water molecule.

12:35.960 --> 12:41.790
It is in this way that nuclear and atomic physics were successfully understood and exploited.

12:42.050 --> 12:50.030
Even today, nuclear reactions, atoms, molecules and several properties of matter can be explained.

12:50.840 --> 12:57.890
Solid-State physics is one of the most prolific sciences of modern times, Schrodinger's equation and

12:57.890 --> 12:58.490
much more.

12:58.490 --> 13:05.750
In general, the eigenvalue equation of Dirac's not notation, which builds upon the burning fuel,

13:06.350 --> 13:13.570
turned out to be a powerful mathematical tool which led to the quantum revolution of the 20th century.

13:14.750 --> 13:22.130
This allowed physicists to develop a sophisticated but consistent theory that proved to be correct over

13:22.130 --> 13:30.950
and over again, providing also a formidable theoretical background that allowed applied physics to

13:30.950 --> 13:38.690
build the material basis upon which the modern electronic devices in the industry was revolutionized.

13:39.720 --> 13:47.340
If you are using your computer now, it is also because of this theoretical developments in quantum

13:47.340 --> 13:56.340
physics, which allowed for building modern integrated circuits and chips and with which we nowadays

13:56.340 --> 14:01.320
build our electronic devices on the theory.

14:01.320 --> 14:07.830
On the theoretical side, adding special relativity to this non relativity with the quantum mechanics

14:08.250 --> 14:14.940
led to the standard model of particle physics, which can be considered one of the most successful and

14:14.940 --> 14:17.820
precise scientific theories ever.
