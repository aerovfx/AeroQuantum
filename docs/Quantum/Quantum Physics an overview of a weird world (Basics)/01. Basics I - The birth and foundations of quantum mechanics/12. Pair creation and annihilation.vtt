00:00.950 --> 00:08.840
Another effect which is worth mentioning is the power creation and annihilation effect, which can occur

00:08.990 --> 00:17.570
as an alternative to quantum scattering instead of the photon and electron being scattered.

00:18.140 --> 00:26.930
What occurs in this case is an absorption of the photon by another particle or atomic nucleus and an

00:26.930 --> 00:31.880
immediate release of its energy in the form of material particles.

00:32.690 --> 00:34.280
This is power creation.

00:35.300 --> 00:44.480
Power creation is a physical phenomenon whereby a high energy massless photon is converted into material

00:44.480 --> 00:46.280
particles with a mass.

00:48.150 --> 00:57.300
The pair creation effect was discovered in 1933 by the British physicist Patrick Blacket, this phenomenon

00:57.450 --> 01:05.790
clearly showed that we must conceive of light not only as made of photons, but also that they can transform

01:05.970 --> 01:13.500
these particles of photons into other material particles, completely different material particles like,

01:13.500 --> 01:15.450
for instance, electrons.

01:17.230 --> 01:25.900
There is also the opposite process, namely bear annihilation, whereby two massive particles.

01:27.040 --> 01:36.430
An electron and an anti electron positron are converted into two photons that this matter is converted

01:36.430 --> 01:44.350
into photons, into pure electromagnetic energy and usually high energy gamma rays not visible in for

01:44.350 --> 01:54.100
the human eye per creation or even annihilation are a striking example of Einstein's energy mass equivalence,

01:54.100 --> 02:04.570
which is described by his famous formula, Equal M C squared, where M is the rest mass of of a particle

02:05.140 --> 02:09.490
and which is called also the rest energy and relativity.

02:09.490 --> 02:16.740
The mass of a fast moving, moving object can no longer be handled as the classical rest mass.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.450
But we won't go further into this year.

02:19.900 --> 02:26.350
And again, see the letter C is always the letter for the speed of light.

02:27.340 --> 02:36.040
The energy mass equivalence tells us that every particle atom or any material object with a mass contains

02:36.040 --> 02:42.910
an energy in we may speak in potential form, so to speak, which is given by Einstein's formula.

02:43.960 --> 02:51.850
The fact that there is the speed of light squared in this formula makes the amount of energy contained

02:51.850 --> 02:54.130
in matter really huge.

02:54.910 --> 02:56.350
Only a gram.

02:57.320 --> 03:05.960
Of matter, if converted into kinetic energy, would cause an explosion like that of the bombing of

03:05.960 --> 03:07.490
Hiroshima, for example.

03:08.410 --> 03:11.200
In the case of Gamma Photon.

03:12.150 --> 03:19.680
Power creation, two electrons can material materials if a single photon interacts with matter, say,

03:19.710 --> 03:24.070
a heavy nucleus and convert it into matter.

03:25.410 --> 03:33.510
One of these material, outgoing particles will be the negatively charged electron Ã©minence, while

03:33.510 --> 03:37.230
the other is a positively charged anti electron.

03:37.530 --> 03:40.710
E-Plus also called a positron.

03:42.270 --> 03:50.940
Anti matter in general is made of the same particles with the same mass that is of electrons, protons

03:50.940 --> 03:57.720
and neutrons, etc., but with the opposite electrical charge and also opposite spin, we will learn

03:57.720 --> 03:59.160
later what this means.

04:01.110 --> 04:07.860
This process, however, can only happen if the energy of the incoming photon is sufficiently large

04:08.010 --> 04:11.510
to produce the two electrons, according to Einstein's formula.

04:12.510 --> 04:20.460
If the photons energy is lower than twice the energy of the of the of the two electrons, the process

04:20.460 --> 04:28.140
cannot occur and the photon will not be absorbed, but eventually scattered in a light like with the

04:28.140 --> 04:29.010
quantum effect.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.290
Fortunately, for some reason, that is still not entirely clear.

04:34.920 --> 04:39.560
The universe we live in is made almost only of one type of particle.

04:40.110 --> 04:48.390
Otherwise we would have already evaporated, so to speak, away in a fome universe where particles annihilate

04:48.390 --> 04:53.730
and create themselves continuously and therefore stars, planets.

04:53.730 --> 05:00.390
And of course, life as we know it at least could suddenly not have formed in the first place.

05:04.480 --> 05:11.740
We have listed so far several phenomenon which indicate how energy is absorbed and emitted in a quantized

05:11.740 --> 05:19.870
manner and which therefore led to a crepuscular corpuscular interpretation of light the black body radiation,

05:20.200 --> 05:26.950
the photoelectric effect, the Frankfurt bankcards experiment and the content effect.

05:26.950 --> 05:33.490
Amper creation and annihilation as well can all be viewed in this context.

05:35.020 --> 05:42.820
These represent a sufficient number of observational evidence that justify also the rude and fundamental

05:42.820 --> 05:47.080
meaning of the names quantum physics, quantum mechanics or quantum theory.

05:48.490 --> 05:53.520
So on one side, we saw how light behaves as a wave.

05:54.280 --> 06:01.150
On the other side, electromagnetic radiation behaves as if it is made of particles.

06:02.740 --> 06:05.380
Which of the two points of view are correct?

06:05.410 --> 06:09.450
Now, what is nature trying to tell us here?

06:10.750 --> 06:14.650
This will be the main focus of the coming lecture's.
