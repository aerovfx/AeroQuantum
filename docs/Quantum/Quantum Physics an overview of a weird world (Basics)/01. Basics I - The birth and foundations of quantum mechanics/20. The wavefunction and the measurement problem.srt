WEBVTT

00:00.780 --> 00:09.270
Let us return back briefly to the Braly hypothesis here, we had to deal with an abstract object, with

00:09.270 --> 00:17.940
a sort of conceptual synthesis that resembles us quite well, both a wave as well as the appearance

00:17.940 --> 00:18.800
of a particle.

00:19.710 --> 00:26.730
Every particle in quantum theory, like the electrons, protons, photons, etc., can be represented

00:26.730 --> 00:35.070
by a wave packet that is a small, localized wave that travels throughout space and which has a frequency

00:35.280 --> 00:42.710
or wavelength, if you prefer, and it has a maximum central value that decays quickly on both sides.

00:43.740 --> 00:52.080
It is a way to visualize a wave that nevertheless can interact locally as a particle and fits well into

00:52.080 --> 00:59.640
the wave particle duality where the quantum objects seem to behave as waves and yet as particles.

00:59.640 --> 01:06.690
To recall what we found out in the lecture on the different wavelength and the concept of the wave packet,

01:08.490 --> 01:13.830
then we have also seen that in quantum mechanics we have to deal with internal interference phenomena

01:13.830 --> 01:17.820
which have some similarities with that of the waves of classical mechanics.

01:18.570 --> 01:26.790
We introduced the concept of the phase between two waves or a phase relative to an origin, and we saw

01:26.820 --> 01:30.060
how this is reflected in the formalism of quantum theory.

01:31.170 --> 01:39.510
And there we saw that it is sometimes easier to write wave phenomena not with real numbers, but more

01:39.510 --> 01:48.570
generally with complex numbers representing waves in space and time as complex functions with real and

01:48.570 --> 01:49.710
imaginary part.

01:50.830 --> 01:51.460
This week.

01:52.670 --> 01:59.420
Make it clear, especially in the lecture of the appendix, the mathematical appendix, if you need

01:59.420 --> 02:06.410
further insight on this, I invite you to take a look also to the appendix lecture.

02:08.330 --> 02:15.740
Here you see an example of the simulation of an electron, one dimensional travelling wave packet,

02:16.700 --> 02:22.550
the mathematical function which describes a wave packet or any quantum mechanical description of the

02:22.550 --> 02:26.020
state of the system, is called the wave function.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.330
And this is usually written with the letter C.

02:31.840 --> 02:38.080
The wavefunction contains all the information, the information about a particle or a quantum system

02:38.080 --> 02:49.030
in space coordinates X and in time T as C, X, T, upsy of X, T, this is, in fact the conventional

02:49.030 --> 02:54.100
and standard mathematical descriptions, description of waves in quantum mechanics.

02:55.090 --> 03:02.560
The red line represents the real part of the wave function, whereas the green is the imaginary part

03:02.560 --> 03:10.180
of the recall, as we have described in the mathematical appendix, that the face of the real and imaginary

03:10.180 --> 03:17.440
parts are shifted by 90 degrees to each other because, according to Euler's, Formula One can express

03:17.440 --> 03:21.810
the former with a cosine function and the letter with the same function.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.020
But we will not dwell in these mathematical details.

03:26.470 --> 03:34.060
More relevant, irrelevant at this stage for us is to recognize the models of the wavefunction, the

03:34.060 --> 03:37.170
blue line, which envelopes the wave packet.

03:37.900 --> 03:44.760
It is this quantity that is of practical value, as we will see now.

03:45.310 --> 03:53.320
But first, as you can see, with time passing by, the wave packet becomes larger due to dispersion

03:53.320 --> 03:53.830
effects.

03:54.700 --> 04:00.670
This is a more realistic representation of a wave function since it takes into account not only the

04:00.670 --> 04:09.880
speed of a particle, but also that due to Heisenberg's uncertainty and the initial conditions of a

04:09.880 --> 04:14.730
particle for particle's position and momentum are uncertain.

04:15.700 --> 04:22.720
And then this uncertainty inevitably will grow with time, since the difference between two possible

04:22.720 --> 04:30.610
initial conditions will reflect itself after some time, also in a difference of its whereabouts, of

04:30.610 --> 04:37.090
the particles whereabouts which will become larger and larger with time passing by.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.300
Letters represent this in still image.

04:43.160 --> 04:48.530
Again, if you take a look in the mathematical appendix, you will discover that we can represent the

04:48.530 --> 04:53.500
intensity of a wave that is a real positive number.

04:53.900 --> 05:00.950
That is the physical quantity that we really measure, say, the number of photons we measure arriving

05:00.950 --> 05:08.690
on a specific area, on a detection screen as being given by the squared models of the wave function

05:09.290 --> 05:22.550
as PSI models squared equal, say, of X times of X complex conjugate, where here we consider only

05:22.550 --> 05:27.080
the change in space variable X leaving out the change in time.

05:27.240 --> 05:28.640
That is the variable T.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.340
Therefore, it is conventional to depict a wave packett as in the foot in this figure.

05:35.750 --> 05:43.100
You see the real part of a wavefunction in blue and it's squared models in red which represent the effectively

05:43.100 --> 05:44.510
measured intensity.

05:45.170 --> 05:50.030
The imaginary part here is not shown here just for the sake of simplicity.

05:51.470 --> 05:59.150
The Delta X is taken as measuring the width of the Wave packett and corresponds to the uncertainty of

05:59.150 --> 06:02.540
the position of a particle due to Heisenberg's inequality.

06:04.540 --> 06:11.800
If you think of the density of dots, for instance, those forming the interference fringes infringes

06:11.800 --> 06:19.780
on the screen of the Dabbous experiment, that is the number of photons hitting per unit area, the

06:19.780 --> 06:28.630
photographic plate or a camera or whatever kind of detector, then the intensity is just proportional

06:28.640 --> 06:30.700
to the density of dots.

06:31.150 --> 06:31.340
Uh.

06:33.160 --> 06:41.650
The registered number of particles on the screen per unit area, or as it is represented graphically

06:41.650 --> 06:49.870
in this picture, like the transparency of the red particle around and origin, is what can be taken

06:49.870 --> 06:56.790
to be proportional to the probability, to a probability to find the particle in that specific area.

06:58.740 --> 07:07.260
Now, you might recall that while the overall disposition of many photons on the screen resembles that

07:07.260 --> 07:14.100
of the interference fringes, it is nevertheless always a completely probabilistic process that determines

07:14.280 --> 07:16.590
whether a single particle will hit the screen.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.680
We have already discussed this.

07:20.730 --> 07:26.260
The appearance of one photon as a dot on the screen is a purely statistical phenomenon.

07:27.480 --> 07:36.150
Therefore, one can regard the intensity that is the squared models of the wavefunction model squared

07:36.150 --> 07:46.050
of PI as something proportional to a probability per unit area and which is called simply probability

07:46.050 --> 07:46.680
density.

07:48.560 --> 07:56.690
This square models of the wavefunction is the master tool with which physicists describe probabilities

07:56.690 --> 08:03.650
in quantum mechanics, that is, that which connects theory, a pure theory of pure mathematical theory

08:03.650 --> 08:11.600
and formalism with the experiments and observations one makes in a laboratory.

08:12.980 --> 08:20.930
It is this latter quantity that is finally what allows an abstract, complex mathematical function to

08:20.930 --> 08:23.060
correlate with reality.

08:24.070 --> 08:29.230
This can describe it by the measurement process and the.

08:30.740 --> 08:34.640
Experiment physicists perform in the laboratory.

08:37.130 --> 08:43.730
You can introduce the following interpretation then, which is due to the German physicist Max Bond

08:44.810 --> 08:53.750
and is also called the bond rule and which tells us that the square models of the wavefunction sea is

08:53.750 --> 09:01.940
a probability density to observe a quantum system in a specific state or a range of states.

09:03.730 --> 09:11.830
To make it clear what this rule means, let us consider this graph, let us suppose that the curve represents

09:11.830 --> 09:18.320
the probability density to find a particle around a Norwegian someplace, somewhere.

09:19.660 --> 09:28.060
If the horizontal axis represents the position X where a particle can be found, the vertical axis is

09:28.060 --> 09:33.550
a probability density P of X to find it at the position X.

09:35.130 --> 09:40.600
You will find frequently such kind of bell shaped curve in several textbooks.

09:40.950 --> 09:50.190
It is the so-called normal or Gaussian distribution, but probability density is still not a quantity

09:50.190 --> 09:56.320
that can be measured, since it's since it represents only an infinitesimal quantity.

09:56.820 --> 10:03.260
It makes no sense to ask what the probability is to find a particle in a specific position since the

10:03.270 --> 10:08.790
in the interval on the space axis in such a case would be zero.

10:09.900 --> 10:18.210
One can only say with what probability a particle can be localized in a specific spatial interval around

10:18.210 --> 10:25.110
the origin, say the Delta X we worked with in Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.

10:26.530 --> 10:34.360
The name density is no coincidence, just think of the density of matter, the material density function

10:34.360 --> 10:40.410
of the body describes how the density in it varies inside a volume.

10:41.440 --> 10:48.400
But this still isn't enough to tell us something about the amount of matter if we don't specify how

10:48.400 --> 10:50.410
large this volume is.

10:52.030 --> 11:01.270
Similarly, the wave function and its associated square models, that is the probability density describes

11:01.270 --> 11:07.630
all the possible states of a system, but still does not tell us the probability to find it in a range

11:07.630 --> 11:08.680
of possible states.

11:10.320 --> 11:18.120
Therefore, what we need to consider is the sum of the probability density function over a specific

11:18.120 --> 11:26.490
range that tells us something, this tells us something about the effective probability P a v capital

11:26.490 --> 11:29.190
letters to find it in that range.

11:30.860 --> 11:38.870
For example, for normal distributions, the X interval of plus minus sigma, this is a letter he is

11:38.870 --> 11:47.480
Sigma is the definition, the range that determines a sixty eight point to seven percent probability

11:47.480 --> 11:48.740
to find a particle.

11:49.550 --> 11:56.980
Sigma is called the standard deviation and tells us something about the dispersion of a set of data

11:56.990 --> 11:57.530
values.

11:58.670 --> 12:07.660
The probability to find the particle far from the center drops off quickly at plus minus three times

12:07.670 --> 12:08.160
sigma.

12:08.450 --> 12:10.220
It is almost zero.

12:11.750 --> 12:18.080
It might also be of interest to know that mathematically and mathematically rigorous approach to Heisenberg's

12:18.080 --> 12:25.310
uncertainty principle holds precisely when the uncertainty range of the particles position and the momentum

12:25.580 --> 12:35.240
is the standard deviation and therefore can be also reformulated as Sigma X times sigma p greater equal.

12:35.600 --> 12:46.970
Each bar have in general to obtain a probability P in capital letters to distinguish it from the lowercase

12:46.970 --> 12:48.200
P of the.

12:49.780 --> 12:57.700
Probability density to find a to obtain the probability P to find the particle inside some spatial range

12:57.700 --> 13:05.400
plus minus X, we must take the integral of the probability density over that entire interval.

13:06.220 --> 13:11.740
That is the integral over the squared models of PSI of X.

13:15.060 --> 13:25.170
So we have this one P equals the integral from minus X to plus X of the squared models of SPSSI of X,

13:25.770 --> 13:37.500
the X where the X, the X tells us along which dimension, along which physical value we have to integrate.

13:38.430 --> 13:46.560
And integral is the area under the graph function, which can be obtained as a sum over all the functions

13:46.560 --> 13:49.380
values at each point along the x axis.

13:51.150 --> 13:56.370
Even if you are not accustomed with integral calculus, it is not so difficult to visualize this.

13:57.570 --> 14:04.740
For instance, just think of how the mass of your body is given by the integral over a mass density

14:04.740 --> 14:07.170
function of all of its value.

14:07.650 --> 14:12.630
Again, take a look to the appendix mathematical appendix lecture.

14:13.440 --> 14:19.530
And of course, if you consider the probability to find a particle anywhere throughout the universe,

14:19.530 --> 14:24.750
so to speak, the spatial range must be infinite that is taken.

14:25.260 --> 14:31.470
You have to take X equals plus minus infinity as a domain of integration.

14:32.310 --> 14:35.910
Then obviously you will get 100 percent probability.

14:36.210 --> 14:43.560
That is certainty to find the particle somewhere, which mathematically translates into the integral

14:43.800 --> 14:48.690
giving unity and which we describe in this way here.

14:50.040 --> 14:58.980
The integral which has as integration domain from minus infinity to plus infinity, and which obviously

14:58.980 --> 15:06.780
has to give and number one, if the wave function is normalized, so to speak, which means the wave

15:06.810 --> 15:16.320
function must be must have values and must be rescate in such a way that if we integrate it over an

15:16.320 --> 15:19.320
infinite range, then it must give one.

15:21.870 --> 15:29.550
The expression in the brackets on the left hand side of the equation is just a more compact form to

15:29.550 --> 15:30.850
express the integral.

15:31.530 --> 15:38.460
It is a quite common shorthand in quantum theory that it will take up in more detail also later.

15:40.490 --> 15:46.070
More generally, the wavefunction applies not only to a particle's position, but to any possible state,

15:46.880 --> 15:53.540
it is a calculation tool with which also the probability to find a particle having a momentum or angular

15:53.540 --> 16:02.390
momentum, the rotational speed and atom or a nucleus being in some energetic state can have, etc..

16:03.680 --> 16:10.310
And the take away message of all of that is that quantum mechanics is a purely probabilistic theory

16:11.540 --> 16:12.210
at bottom.

16:12.230 --> 16:14.200
This is due to its wavy nature.

16:14.540 --> 16:20.630
There is no way to know what the behavior of a single particle will be, even not in principle.

16:21.530 --> 16:26.870
Except when the particle is in what is called an Afghan state, as we will see later.

16:27.860 --> 16:35.210
That is why in quantum theory, statistical tools play such an important role, we can only compute

16:35.210 --> 16:41.090
the probability to measure a value in some interval in quantum mechanics.

16:41.540 --> 16:46.840
Quantum mechanics, it makes no sense to speak of a system that is in some state.

16:47.660 --> 16:53.600
It makes only sense to say that there is a certain probability that the measurement will furnish an

16:53.600 --> 16:59.150
outcome and that we associate with some state at the instant of measurement.

17:00.320 --> 17:06.920
But we are not allowed to say anything on its state before and after that measurement.

17:07.950 --> 17:15.390
The wavefunction is a state function only in the sense that it is a mathematical tool that tells us

17:15.570 --> 17:24.240
about the statistics and probability to find a specific system in a specific state or a range of possible

17:24.240 --> 17:24.690
states.

17:26.290 --> 17:34.060
At this point, the question is whether the wavefunction is just an abstract mathematical description

17:34.060 --> 17:39.760
of the statistical behavior of a system, or does it really represent a real object in the physical

17:39.760 --> 17:40.150
world?

17:41.390 --> 17:48.020
And if it has to be considered real, how can it be that it is something that behaves like a wave and

17:48.020 --> 17:51.170
then turns out to describe particles?

17:51.920 --> 17:59.720
This question poses a problem, which is the so-called measurement problem or what is more popularly

17:59.720 --> 18:03.330
known as the problem of the wavefunction collapse.

18:04.280 --> 18:09.560
It is one of the typical quantum ontological philosophical problems.

18:10.320 --> 18:17.570
It is illustrated with what we already know and saw in the double slit experiment, namely that first

18:17.570 --> 18:24.590
a plane wave is distracted by the slits and then the two expanding concerned concentric circles wavefront

18:24.680 --> 18:29.240
emerging from each of the approaches to have towards the screen.

18:30.080 --> 18:33.290
These wavefront can be described by the wavefunction.

18:33.440 --> 18:42.020
See, once they interact with the screen, the interference fringes form, but as a pattern of dots,

18:42.470 --> 18:49.190
each representing a point like interaction at some specific position, there is nothing left of any

18:49.220 --> 18:49.750
wave.

18:50.540 --> 18:58.010
And so we see that first we have the wave function and suddenly it seems to collapse into a point.

18:59.450 --> 19:07.100
This suggests an interpretation that tries a bit desperately, I might say, to reconcile the two apparently

19:07.100 --> 19:08.330
opposite points of view.

19:09.140 --> 19:17.030
First, before the measurement, we must conceive of the single photon or electron or whatever particle

19:17.030 --> 19:25.280
we may talk about as a wave or wave packets, which still before the measurement, that is, before

19:25.280 --> 19:31.400
it hits the screen, continues to behave according to the diffraction and interpretive interference,

19:31.400 --> 19:32.600
laws and principles.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.860
There is nothing that should be conceived as a particle.

19:37.700 --> 19:44.060
When the wavefront goes through the slits, it is still a wave and there is no particle that is supposed

19:44.060 --> 19:51.350
to go through one or both slits, or only in the sense we might be authorized to say that quantum mechanics,

19:51.650 --> 19:56.860
a single particle, goes through both slits and interferes with itself.

19:58.340 --> 20:06.650
But this is a very desperate point of view, I would say, whereas at the instant of measurement or

20:07.250 --> 20:16.040
interaction of the particle with another particle or with its surroundings, or it falls down on the

20:16.040 --> 20:22.640
ground on and interacts with another microscopic or macroscopic object.

20:23.930 --> 20:30.950
However, in our case, at the instant where the wave interacts with the screen, it suddenly reduces

20:31.220 --> 20:37.240
or collapses to a point on the screen, manifesting itself again as a particle.

20:37.880 --> 20:43.640
But before that instant, where the act of measurement, of course, or the.

20:44.610 --> 20:52.230
Interaction, of course, you must still consider to be a wave with an extension in space, not a single

20:52.230 --> 20:52.620
point.

20:54.730 --> 20:59.900
From the mathematical, mathematical and formal abstract point of view, everything is clear.

21:00.430 --> 21:05.560
You just calculate with the wave function and then take the squared models and obtain the probability,

21:05.560 --> 21:13.150
the probability density where you will find your particle, integrate over a region of interest and

21:13.150 --> 21:22.750
obtain a statement about the probability to observe the system in some specific region and for a specific

21:22.750 --> 21:28.250
state here, the particle to be detected inside a spatial interval along the screen.

21:29.140 --> 21:32.160
Therefore, the problem is not not mathematical.

21:32.320 --> 21:37.900
We may say it is not even scientific, but it is an interpretational problem.

21:38.980 --> 21:45.790
A question arises in the domain of the ontology of the philosophical speculation.

21:45.920 --> 21:54.310
We might say from the ontological point of view, there is no consensus as to how we really should interpret

21:54.310 --> 21:59.040
this collapse and what kind of objective reality quantum mechanics is describing.

21:59.050 --> 22:07.300
After all, what kind of thing is it that behaves as a wave unless one looks at it and then it collapses

22:07.300 --> 22:11.480
to a point instantly in an infinitesimal interval of time?

22:12.580 --> 22:14.290
What is really out there?

22:14.440 --> 22:22.540
We might say before the measurement, it seems that we have only a sort of ghostly entity, the way

22:22.540 --> 22:30.750
we nature of which we will never observe directly, but we can infer from the interference phenomena.

22:30.880 --> 22:37.780
And at the Measurement Act, it manifests nevertheless as a completely different entity, namely as

22:37.780 --> 22:39.160
a point like particle.

22:40.210 --> 22:46.630
And there is no way to intercept a morphing transformation from one entity to the another.

22:48.010 --> 22:53.290
After all, we are talking about a probability wave travelling through space.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.750
But the notion of probability is an abstract mathematical concept.

22:57.770 --> 22:59.610
It is just a mathematical function.

22:59.660 --> 23:07.250
Mathematicians write with a pencil on a piece of paper that we do not think of as an object, having

23:07.250 --> 23:11.230
a concrete existing moving out there somewhere.

23:12.470 --> 23:15.390
One can see waterways on a lake here.

23:15.410 --> 23:20.330
Sound waves through air perceive light and sea birds flying.

23:20.480 --> 23:29.330
But nobody has ever seen a mathematical function or the square root of minus one moving throughout space.

23:30.680 --> 23:33.830
And yet this is what quantum physics seems to be about.

23:34.580 --> 23:40.280
It seems that we must not only resort to very abstract notions to describe the world, but the world

23:40.280 --> 23:46.940
itself seems to be a sort of mathematical abstraction reminiscent of a platonic region.

23:47.930 --> 23:56.650
Is there anything physical out there that is represented by see is a collapse of see only a statistical

23:56.660 --> 24:01.760
or is it also real physical entity occurrence?

24:03.800 --> 24:10.310
So far, nobody has been able to furnish a really convincing and generally accepted answer to these

24:10.310 --> 24:10.900
questions.

24:11.690 --> 24:17.690
Most physicists simply do not bother and will tell you that they are too busy with making calculations,

24:18.670 --> 24:20.720
are happy that the math works.

24:21.380 --> 24:28.550
And indeed, the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics were extremely powerful in furnishing,

24:28.730 --> 24:35.240
furnishing predictions that could be measured and confirmed and which led to the tremendously successful

24:35.750 --> 24:40.910
standard model of particle physics, atomic physics, solid state physics and so on.

24:42.260 --> 24:48.350
With all their practical applications in applied physics as well.

24:49.370 --> 24:56.420
But from the interpretational point of view, not much progress has been made, and this suggests that

24:56.420 --> 25:00.440
we have still not gone deep enough in our understanding of the world.

25:01.160 --> 25:05.780
For many years, physicists delighted themselves with calculations.

25:06.350 --> 25:13.730
But recent attempts to build quantum computers, which need more or less direct answers to these questions,

25:13.730 --> 25:19.910
and after decades of attempts without success, to discover a general theory of quantum gravity, that

25:19.910 --> 25:27.860
kind of theory that reconciles the gravity force with electromagnetic and nuclear forces, these foundational

25:28.040 --> 25:32.630
foundational issues have gotten more attention again.
