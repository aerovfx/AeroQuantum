00:01.260 --> 00:08.190
We are now in a position to analyze the phenomenon of interference in real world physical phenomena.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.640
We can begin with a classical example.

00:12.040 --> 00:17.460
That is what one observes in the so-called thin film interference.

00:18.600 --> 00:28.660
This will open up the way for us to understand the friction and the wave particle duality in this figure.

00:28.680 --> 00:34.940
You can see a couple of light rays with a certain angle of incidence reflected by a thin film surface.

00:36.000 --> 00:43.350
This thin film surface could be, for example, made of water or the mixing of oil and water on the

00:43.350 --> 00:52.910
road, as you may have observed, probably on a street after a rainstorm or as in this photograph here,

00:52.980 --> 00:54.570
that of a soap bubble.

00:57.180 --> 01:05.700
The nice colouring of oil firms, or as we enjoyed as kids on soap bubbles, is an interference phenomenon

01:05.940 --> 01:07.910
that can be explained as follows.

01:09.150 --> 01:17.150
These films have a very small but not negligible thickness limited by an upper layer and lower layer.

01:18.390 --> 01:24.600
The reflection of light onto these layers can be visualized as a first beam beam.

01:24.600 --> 01:32.450
A light goes unperturbed through the Appalachians and will be reflected by the lower layer of the film.

01:33.360 --> 01:39.830
And then there is also the second beam beam B, which is reflected by the upper layer.

01:41.310 --> 01:47.700
If we examine the situation carefully, it is easy to recognize that there is a difference in the travelled

01:47.700 --> 01:57.150
path between the two light rays, even if both both light rays are emitted at the same time from the

01:57.150 --> 02:01.080
same source and arrive with the same angle.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.520
That is, they are parallel to each others.

02:05.610 --> 02:14.490
When the reach that reach the two thin film layers, they are reflected at different depths and therefore

02:14.490 --> 02:16.560
acquire a different.

02:17.500 --> 02:25.840
Small hour, as you can see here, that is a face difference relative to each others, their little

02:25.840 --> 02:30.880
yellow segment of length L is given here.

02:31.330 --> 02:42.400
You can see here the two beams then sum up and superimpose or overlay after the reflection, interfering

02:42.400 --> 02:45.430
according to their face difference.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.350
This phase difference is determined only by the incident angle once the thickness of the film and its

02:54.350 --> 02:56.810
refractive index are fixed.

02:58.780 --> 03:08.040
This implies that the outgoing light can interfere constructively or destructively or somewhere in between

03:08.680 --> 03:11.370
for every specific reflection angle.

03:13.000 --> 03:21.700
We will observe different resulting waves in intensity and wave length along the different angular positions

03:22.180 --> 03:26.600
where we place our eyes or our detector.

03:27.370 --> 03:35.980
And this is also why we can observe all the beautiful plurality of color patterns on the surface of

03:35.980 --> 03:36.790
a soap bubble.

03:39.130 --> 03:45.970
The same thing from interference does not only work with water layers in visible light, but also for

03:46.180 --> 03:52.120
atomic crystal lattice layers at the X-ray wavelength.

03:53.770 --> 04:00.730
In this case, we need very short electro magnetic wavelengths because the distances that separate the

04:00.730 --> 04:08.410
different atomic crystalline layers, also called crystallography planes are very small.

04:09.430 --> 04:12.760
They are of the order of few atomic sizes.

04:13.990 --> 04:22.180
Obviously, at these wavelengths we will no longer deal with color patterns since x rays are well beyond

04:22.180 --> 04:24.130
the human visible light spectrum.

04:24.550 --> 04:28.270
But the underlying principle remains the same.

04:29.710 --> 04:38.410
More precisely at the atomic scale, we can no longer speak of classical reflections on a surface layer,

04:38.740 --> 04:48.520
but must conceive of the photons or waves absorbed by the atom and then readmitted in all directions

04:49.060 --> 04:51.730
in the form of spherical waves.

04:53.110 --> 04:59.980
All these spherical wavefront then sum up and form an interference pattern somewhere.

05:00.010 --> 05:01.630
For example, on a screen.

05:04.660 --> 05:15.160
In fact, in 1913, William Henry Bragg senior and William Lawrence Bragg, junior to British physicist,

05:15.700 --> 05:23.740
discovered how crystalline solids produced pattern of reflected X-rays that could be interpreted only

05:23.740 --> 05:30.580
as interference patterns and which are nowadays called brekke diffraction patterns.

05:32.830 --> 05:42.220
They observed intense maximum M.A of reflected radiation, depending on the wavelength and and the angle

05:42.220 --> 05:49.900
of incidence, something which could not be observed for reflect the radiation of a longer wavelength.

05:51.760 --> 05:59.770
Here again, two incident parallel light beams will be reflected by two underlying crystallography planes

06:00.040 --> 06:01.720
as shown in this figure.

06:03.030 --> 06:10.700
There are essentially three physical variables that determine how the beams will be refracted and interfere.

06:10.980 --> 06:20.670
That is how the outgoing waves will display their relative phase shift, which gives rise to the interference

06:20.910 --> 06:21.400
pattern.

06:22.890 --> 06:28.990
First, all depends from the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves lambda.

06:30.360 --> 06:39.270
Then what determines the phase shift induced by the difference is also the distance the which separates

06:39.630 --> 06:40.920
the atomic layers.

06:42.480 --> 06:44.640
This causes a path difference.

06:45.090 --> 06:52.980
The short red wave is segment in this figure and consentual and consequently a phase difference between

06:52.980 --> 06:54.780
the two emerging beams.

06:56.310 --> 07:03.140
Finally, we must also choose the angle of incidence or equivalent, equivalently, the scattering angle.

07:03.450 --> 07:03.960
Peter.

07:05.420 --> 07:14.690
Or two times the angle, which in any case tells us from what point of view, from which angle we are

07:14.690 --> 07:18.470
looking at the reflected wave.

07:19.520 --> 07:28.130
The appropriate combination of these three parameters will give rise to constructive or destructive

07:28.130 --> 07:36.800
interference once we have chosen some material with some specific chemical composition, the crystal

07:36.800 --> 07:40.070
lattice layers distance the is fixed.

07:41.300 --> 07:49.910
If we maintain the wavelength of our X-ray source as constant, then also the wavelength lambda is fixed

07:49.910 --> 07:50.540
as well.

07:52.280 --> 08:00.860
This means that if we observe the outgoing interfering waves at different angles, then we will see

08:00.860 --> 08:09.770
constructive interference or also destructive interference due to the fact that they correspond to different

08:09.770 --> 08:11.840
parts of the light beams.

08:12.290 --> 08:20.420
That is the phase difference given rise to the respective constructive or destructive interference.

08:22.190 --> 08:30.110
In fact, if you look at the graph on the left, you can see that the waves interfere and overlap in

08:30.110 --> 08:38.510
such a manner according to some specific angle, so that they the two peaks and valleys, so to speak,

08:38.510 --> 08:43.810
of the waves add up and therefore we have constructive interference.

08:44.270 --> 08:53.510
Whereas on the other side, when we have the situation given in the right picture, you can see that

08:53.510 --> 09:03.680
at that at another at another angle, the two waves overlap in such a manner that the peaks and valleys

09:03.920 --> 09:12.640
overlap, not peak peak Valley Valley, but Peak Valley Valley peak, and which means that they subtract

09:12.650 --> 09:16.480
each others and we have destructive interference.

09:17.700 --> 09:27.000
In truth, this is a simplified model, since in practice also the other planes will contribute to the

09:27.000 --> 09:35.220
overall effect, even though to a lesser degree, and these will cause also many more small peaks and

09:35.220 --> 09:38.910
complex diffraction and interference patterns.

09:39.720 --> 09:48.210
But for our purposes here, this may suffer suffice to understand the principle of the fracture.

09:49.420 --> 09:56.590
If you are still struggling with the notions of what the face of a wave is, the amplitude and so on,

09:56.710 --> 10:05.800
I again invite you to go through the appendix lecture lecture where all these conceptual mathematical

10:05.800 --> 10:10.240
foundations we need in this course are quickly summarized.

10:11.550 --> 10:20.100
So this distraction and interference phenomenon can be described with Bragg's law and which tells us

10:20.100 --> 10:27.840
what the conditions for constructive interference from successive crystallography complaints are and

10:27.840 --> 10:39.180
which is given by this formula and times lambda equals two times the times the cosmic sine function

10:39.180 --> 10:44.820
of theta where N is an integer number one, two, three, four, five and so on.

10:45.900 --> 10:57.060
And obviously the angle theta, the angle of incidence and the the distance between the atomic planes

10:58.800 --> 11:04.770
and this formula will tell us where the mÃ¡xima will occur.

11:06.630 --> 11:13.530
If we look at different scattering angles at the same time, for example, on the screen of a photographic

11:13.530 --> 11:24.380
plate or a CCD sensor or some detector that is able to to detect the photons coming onto.

11:26.020 --> 11:34.390
An extensive surface placed in such a manner that they let these sensors or these detectors able to

11:34.390 --> 11:44.050
capture several beams with several angles throughout a surface, then we will observe a very interesting

11:44.050 --> 11:47.410
diffraction pattern as, for example, in this picture.

11:49.540 --> 11:59.200
Here we have a beautiful, symmetric pattern obtained by X-ray interference through a crystal from these

11:59.200 --> 12:08.080
patterns, physicists and chemists are able to interfere with the crystalline atomic structure of substances.

12:09.430 --> 12:17.260
Therefore, brak diffraction is something that allows us to reconstruct the the geometrical displacement

12:17.260 --> 12:19.470
of atoms in the lattices.

12:19.600 --> 12:30.400
In some sense, we might say that it is like a microscope that furnishes indirectly images of the chemical

12:30.400 --> 12:32.680
structure of substances.

12:35.020 --> 12:41.230
Now, you might question what what does this have to do with quantum mechanics, after all?

12:41.920 --> 12:44.150
Well, it has a lot to do with it.

12:45.400 --> 12:52.390
First of all, it is necessary to get rid of a frequent misconception since at a microscopic scale,

12:52.630 --> 12:59.680
the double slit experiment displays light as a wave, while the photoelectric and the Compton effect

12:59.950 --> 13:07.270
vindicate the particle nature of light in a microscopic domain, one might be tempted to believe that

13:07.270 --> 13:10.450
microscopically light is in fact the particle.

13:11.880 --> 13:19.860
In the sense that it might appear and behave like a wave only at human scales, we're looking at it

13:19.860 --> 13:27.000
closely at the scale of molecules, atoms and particles, it is revealed to be a particle, just like

13:27.090 --> 13:37.610
a water wave is microscopically made of tiny H2O water molecules, not so bright.

13:37.620 --> 13:43.830
Diffraction and interference phenomena act at the size of an atomic crystal lattice layer and cannot

13:43.830 --> 13:44.640
be explained.

13:44.640 --> 13:53.400
With classical particle behavior only considering light as a wave, Bragg's father and son could explain

13:53.400 --> 13:57.090
the observed phenomena just like Young could.

13:57.090 --> 14:05.670
With the double slit experiment, Young would have been delighted to see the wave nature of light confirmed

14:05.670 --> 14:07.680
also at the microscopic scale.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.700
But there is much more.

14:11.280 --> 14:20.070
One question that must arise at this point is whether this ambiguous, twofold wave particle manifestation

14:20.220 --> 14:23.010
is something in here and only to light.

14:23.580 --> 14:32.640
Or is it a Zemmour, since it seems to present itself as a wave or a flux of particles according to

14:32.640 --> 14:40.950
what kind of experimental set up one chooses us, then the question arises is, does this duality possibly

14:40.950 --> 14:47.400
hold also for material particles with the mass like electrons or protons?

14:48.860 --> 14:56.660
It might sound unreasonable and terribly counterintuitive even to think of material particles like an

14:56.660 --> 15:05.600
electron and what we imagine as a tiny chunk of metal, a point like particle, to behave like a wave,

15:05.720 --> 15:15.200
as photons do, but then an attempt to put things together under the same umbrella came from the French

15:15.200 --> 15:24.980
physicist Lui's, the parolee who was able to synthesize in a unique theoretical concept the point like

15:24.980 --> 15:29.750
the corpuscular and the wavy nature into a single notion.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.550
They probably realized that.

15:34.470 --> 15:40.770
There is no logical and physical reason to believe that material particles with a mass could not have

15:40.770 --> 15:47.030
this double corpuscular and wavy nature as well, no more or less than photons.

15:48.420 --> 15:57.000
He imagined all the particles, also those those which make up the objects like atoms, molecules and

15:57.000 --> 16:06.780
very material body, very material bodies in the universe, no longer as particles or waves, but as

16:06.780 --> 16:11.400
something which contains conceptually both of these.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.430
That is the so-called wave packett.

16:16.810 --> 16:22.690
This was the famous library hypothesis he framed in 1924.

16:23.590 --> 16:32.290
The idea was that to imagine every object being a travelling wave, but with a special property of being

16:32.290 --> 16:37.690
localized in space like this, like you see in this animation.

16:39.540 --> 16:48.780
If we see things in this perspective, we we can consider any particle with or without mass as having

16:48.780 --> 16:58.290
a specific wavelength with the amplitude of the wave having a maximum in a region of space and which

16:58.290 --> 17:02.540
we intuitively think of as being classically the position of the particle.

17:03.300 --> 17:10.290
But with this amplitude decaying quickly from the center of the peak in all directions.

17:12.580 --> 17:22.150
Here to arbitrary examples of waste packets are shown on the left, a broader wave packet and on the

17:22.150 --> 17:25.550
right, a smaller one which differ in their wavelength.

17:26.590 --> 17:33.820
If you look at these wave packets from large distances compared to their wavelength, say, from 20

17:33.820 --> 17:39.570
or 30 meters, in this example, you can approximately consider them particles.

17:39.730 --> 17:43.390
Since it's Swabi, nature is no longer discernible.

17:46.110 --> 17:52.920
If we look at the wave packet at distances of the order of the wave length, however, or smaller wave

17:52.920 --> 17:55.990
length, it appears to be a wave.

17:56.610 --> 18:00.540
In this sense, we may speak of the wave length of a particle.

18:01.360 --> 18:08.230
An expression which otherwise in the classical context would have resulted as nonsensical.

18:09.210 --> 18:18.090
A gentle warning is compulsory here, one might be tempted to interpret the size of the wave packet

18:18.090 --> 18:22.500
as the size of the particle or the object under consideration.

18:23.350 --> 18:28.860
However, we shall see that this intuitive understanding is not correct for the time being.

18:28.860 --> 18:36.360
Just take the wave packet for what it is a mathematical abstract construct that saves appearances,

18:36.360 --> 18:37.230
so to speak.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.920
That is that it explains.

18:41.310 --> 18:51.660
Well, the observed four phenomena of the experiments liberally also quantified all this with a very

18:51.660 --> 19:00.120
simple and neat formula which relates the wavelength lambda of a particle or more precisely, the wavelength

19:00.120 --> 19:06.870
of its corresponding wave packet as being inversely proportional to its momentum.

19:06.870 --> 19:07.230
P.

19:08.960 --> 19:20.300
That is lamda equals H over p h, of course, as usual, the plank's constant and P is the momentum

19:20.300 --> 19:28.820
of a particle which in classical mechanics is always given as the product of the mass of the particle

19:29.210 --> 19:31.040
times its velocity.

19:31.040 --> 19:31.430
V.

19:33.290 --> 19:41.690
The right hand side, the right hand side part of the of this equation holds only four material particles

19:41.690 --> 19:51.320
with a non-zero mass and is correct only if we can ignore relativistic relativistic effects, whereas

19:51.320 --> 19:58.850
the term H over P is more general and has a universal validity for photons.

19:58.880 --> 20:08.030
As for material particles and is also exact also in relativity, it associates a wavelength to any kind

20:08.030 --> 20:12.110
of particle independently if it has a mass or not.

20:12.470 --> 20:16.530
If it is a mass, it can be also an electron or proton or neutron.

20:16.880 --> 20:25.340
In this case, its wavelength, which we associate with this material particles, is given by the relation

20:25.340 --> 20:26.690
of the early.

20:29.650 --> 20:36.730
This can be shown with a not too rigorous proof, which highlights where this equation comes from.

20:39.160 --> 20:49.510
First of all, set, uh, in science, math and education, we know that the energy contained in a particle

20:49.510 --> 20:59.110
of mass M is given by E equal M times C squared as C is, as usual, the speed of light.

21:00.630 --> 21:05.510
From which follows that the math can be written as M. equal.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.560
E over C squared.

21:09.740 --> 21:17.030
And recalling again that the momentum of a particle is a product of its mass times, its velocity.

21:18.270 --> 21:26.580
Then if we take seriously the idea to put photons and material particles on the same footing, we can

21:26.580 --> 21:34.470
replace the mess and the above equation with the letter expression and the speed with that of light,

21:34.620 --> 21:40.980
that is with the equal C to obtain P of the photon.

21:41.910 --> 21:44.190
Equal to oversee.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.220
This expresses the momentum of a photon of energy.

21:51.990 --> 21:52.860
Photons.

21:55.140 --> 22:02.340
As all other particles are able to carry and transmit certain amounts of momentum to other particles,

22:02.850 --> 22:09.570
recall how photons, even if we do not visualize them as material particles, are nevertheless able

22:09.570 --> 22:16.020
to give, so to speak, a kick to a material particle, as we already saw in the case of the Compton

22:16.020 --> 22:16.620
scattering.

22:18.480 --> 22:28.140
Now, recall also that the ever present blank formula in the form of equal age times known with.

22:29.140 --> 22:37.390
Lou, the frequency and which is given, which can be written also as age times, sea of alarm, that

22:37.390 --> 22:43.480
since know the frequency is nothing else, that the speed of light divided its wavelength.

22:45.520 --> 22:53.950
Rewriting all this in terms of lamda, one obtains lamda equals H over.

22:55.050 --> 23:04.280
You oversee this record here, and we said he oversees nothing else than the momentum of the photon,

23:04.770 --> 23:13.860
therefore we can write this righteous also as H of a P, which is finally the the bearly relation.

23:16.410 --> 23:18.830
This proves, in fact, the relation.

23:19.860 --> 23:26.670
So what they really did was that to put together the concept, the concept of the wave and particle

23:27.300 --> 23:34.830
into a single entity, the wave pacard, the wave length of the wave length of which is determined by

23:34.830 --> 23:35.610
its momentum.

23:36.890 --> 23:43.790
In case of material particles, that is not photons, but particles having a mass movings, Lola, is

23:43.790 --> 23:45.410
lower than the speed of light.

23:46.040 --> 23:54.670
It is customary to speak also of metal waves because we associate to every material particle wave.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.830
So we speak of meter waves.

24:00.480 --> 24:08.500
The meter wave of the Dibley hypothesis sheds also some light now on boards atomic model.

24:09.270 --> 24:17.880
In fact, if we understand the electrons not as tiny localised point like particles which orbit around

24:17.880 --> 24:26.820
the atomic nucleus, but as matter waves, that is waves distributed which are distributed concentrically

24:27.090 --> 24:36.090
around the orbit, it becomes quite easy and intuitive to understand why the energy levels of atoms

24:36.240 --> 24:37.760
must be quantized.

24:39.300 --> 24:46.770
They must have discrete levels for the simple reason that if this matter wave has a wavelength which

24:46.770 --> 24:54.840
does not match and not reconnect itself again at the same point along the orbital path.

24:56.400 --> 25:03.930
See, for example, in this diagram, that is if the circumference of the atomic orbit of the electron.

25:04.890 --> 25:13.920
Is not exactly an integral intergovernment multiple of the electrons wavelength, then constructive

25:13.920 --> 25:21.060
interference with itself would no longer be possible and the wave packet distributed around the atomic

25:21.060 --> 25:29.070
nucleus could not be built up as a standing wave structure, which would be like the standing wave we

25:29.070 --> 25:32.610
already discussed, for example, the body cavity.

25:34.790 --> 25:43.370
Here, the principle is the same, but instead of reflections of wave of a wave on a cavity wall, the

25:43.370 --> 25:55.190
wave circulates along an atomic orbit and path and for the same reason allows only for specific oscillating

25:55.190 --> 25:56.450
modes to exist.

25:57.980 --> 26:05.510
The classical notion of orbital velocity of the electron around the nucleus is fixed by the fact that

26:05.510 --> 26:11.930
the electrostatic, attractive forces between the positive electric charge of the nucleus and that of

26:11.930 --> 26:20.240
the negative electron must be balanced by what we may, loosely speaking, call the centrifugal forces

26:20.420 --> 26:22.380
to keep the electron in orbit.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.310
And this, in turn, is given also by its distance from the nucleus.

26:28.430 --> 26:31.250
But this distance cannot be an arbitrary one.

26:31.770 --> 26:40.160
The velocity of the electron that is due to the liberalise relation, the wavelength of the electron

26:40.910 --> 26:48.920
must match just the orbital distance where constructive interference occurs and is equal to just the

26:48.920 --> 26:53.680
speed, which is enough to keep the electron on a circle.

26:53.760 --> 26:55.310
Circular, stable orbit.

26:56.850 --> 27:04.590
It is possible to calculate this in and indeed it turns out that the electron will distribute itself

27:04.890 --> 27:15.000
naturally only on a well-defined, discrete orbit where we have this constructive interference for the

27:15.000 --> 27:17.470
simple case of the hydrogen atom.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.480
This can be calculated with relatively simple algebra and classical classical physics concept, plus

27:24.810 --> 27:26.100
the devilry relation.

27:26.910 --> 27:34.920
And it turns out that indeed only those matter standing waves are allowed to exist, which match the

27:34.920 --> 27:41.790
quantized energy levels experimentally observed in the hydrogen atom atomic spectrum.

27:43.770 --> 27:52.050
Both atomic model added with the Braly hypothesis seemed therefore to gain credibility credibility,

27:52.050 --> 27:57.260
since it explained naturally why atomic levels are quantized.

27:57.750 --> 28:05.280
Unfortunately, as we already pointed out, still, in any case, this does not explain the spectra

28:05.310 --> 28:07.680
of all the other elements.

28:07.710 --> 28:10.980
Nevertheless, also if we use the debris relation.

28:11.580 --> 28:17.420
But in any case, this debris relation shed some light.

28:17.430 --> 28:28.350
Why the atomic spectra must must be discrete levels of energy and must be must express them.

28:28.350 --> 28:30.030
So that must manifest with.

28:31.230 --> 28:33.720
Emission and absorption of.

28:34.960 --> 28:38.170
Discreet packets and quanta of energy.

28:39.860 --> 28:48.320
So go back to break the friction and clarify what we really mean by meter waves, since we can conceive

28:48.320 --> 28:56.650
material particles as, for instance, electrons also as meter waves as we think of light waves.

28:57.170 --> 29:05.090
And since we observed the breath diffraction for electromagnetic waves, as was shown for photons in

29:05.090 --> 29:16.400
the case of the X-ray spectrum, the question at this point is if the Bradley fraction might hold equally

29:16.400 --> 29:19.370
well also for material particles.

29:21.040 --> 29:29.470
Is it conceivable that also tiny chunks of matter like electrons, neutrons, protons or whatever massive

29:29.470 --> 29:38.140
particles can be distracted by the letters of a crystalline substance and display the nice interference

29:38.140 --> 29:41.350
patterns as observed with x rays?

29:42.220 --> 29:43.300
This is a question.

29:45.070 --> 29:53.260
To check this idea, one must send no longer photons, but material particles, say electrons or neutrons

29:53.830 --> 29:57.660
into the crystal lattice by modulating its energy.

29:57.880 --> 30:03.220
That is its momentum, which finally means its speed.

30:04.870 --> 30:14.710
Because this is what determines its wavelength according to the degree the relation in effect, by doing

30:14.710 --> 30:19.170
so, one modulates according to the brain and also its wavelength.

30:19.570 --> 30:29.440
So if the wavelength of the wave packet of the material particle matches more or less, the size of

30:29.440 --> 30:38.140
the crystallography explains separation of the substance which is bombarded with these particles, then

30:38.410 --> 30:45.280
one should expect to observe again, also in this case, the interference patterns.

30:46.960 --> 30:56.770
This experiment in 1927 by the American physicist Lester Girma and Clinton Davisson and independently,

30:56.770 --> 31:01.210
independently also by the British physicist George Thompson.

31:03.160 --> 31:08.320
Passing a beam of electrons through a thin film of metal.

31:09.350 --> 31:16.670
They observed how electrons are subjected exactly to the same interference law that photons are.

31:18.120 --> 31:26.040
What they found were indeed the bread diffraction pattern like those we have seen already before for

31:26.040 --> 31:29.490
the X-ray diffraction patterns.

31:31.140 --> 31:40.650
So the point is also what we imagine to be rock solid chunks of matter when subjected to appropriate

31:40.650 --> 31:44.250
physical conditions display a wavelike nature.

31:45.660 --> 31:52.770
This was also an experimental verification of the debris debris hypothesis, which at this point was

31:52.770 --> 31:56.760
no longer a hypothesis at all, but an experimental fact.

31:57.330 --> 32:03.460
The interference pattern observed corresponded exactly to those expected.

32:03.480 --> 32:12.000
If we adopt the debris relation, this is a universal property of nature, which, however, is not

32:12.000 --> 32:21.060
at all if because from the abstract mathematical point of view, everything is clear and is nicely quantified

32:21.060 --> 32:25.230
and experimentally measured, quantified by the formula.

32:25.440 --> 32:29.990
And we can in fact empirically control that it works.

32:31.200 --> 32:37.890
But from the more ontology, ontological perspective, from the more philosophical perspective, things

32:37.890 --> 32:39.000
are not that clear.

32:39.840 --> 32:49.920
The question is, what are the these particles we are talking about or are they only point like particles

32:49.950 --> 32:55.020
or waves or matter waves are or what?

32:55.020 --> 32:57.470
Are they at the microscopic level?

32:59.750 --> 33:08.150
It is here that the philosophical journey of quantum mechanics began, and this led then to the famous

33:08.150 --> 33:15.140
wave particle duality, the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg, the concepts of the wavefunction,

33:15.140 --> 33:20.570
etc., as we are going now to describe in the next lecture's.
