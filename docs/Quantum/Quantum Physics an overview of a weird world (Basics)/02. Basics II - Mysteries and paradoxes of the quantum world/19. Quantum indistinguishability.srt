00:00.490 --> 00:07.210
Before we proceed to the famous phenomenon of quantum entanglement to better understand what it is about,

00:07.810 --> 00:14.530
we must introduce the concept of quantum indistinguishable indistinguishably, which emerges from quantum

00:14.530 --> 00:15.850
scattering processes.

00:16.630 --> 00:22.110
This is another weird thing about quantum physics, quantum indistinguishable.

00:22.120 --> 00:28.900
It might at first look like the classical indistinguishably of two objects having the same physical

00:28.900 --> 00:38.080
properties between which one can not distinguish, say, for instance, two billiard balls or a collection

00:38.080 --> 00:39.070
of billiard balls.

00:39.790 --> 00:48.070
For our everyday experience, every physical object is distinguishable, even inside a collection made

00:48.070 --> 00:51.580
of many objects having exactly the same properties.

00:52.330 --> 01:00.490
When in our human, macroscopic classical world we want to maintain two equal objects as distinguishable,

01:01.240 --> 01:08.200
say, subjected to a complicated shuffling process that is difficult to keep track of.

01:09.490 --> 01:15.250
We can do this simply by labelling them, say, with A and B.

01:16.110 --> 01:26.370
For example, just take two billiard balls and lather them with A and B, then start the process scattering

01:26.370 --> 01:33.270
process or whatever, for example, shake them inside a box and later look at where one or the other

01:33.270 --> 01:36.390
object is simply by reading the labels.

01:38.090 --> 01:46.640
One might argue that a pending LaBelle's is already differentiating between two unequal objects, then

01:47.150 --> 01:54.290
alternatively, we can follow their path separately, looking at where one or the other object moves

01:54.290 --> 01:57.920
in space and time, even without labels.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.670
If this will be too fast and complicated, we can eventually record it using a video camera.

02:04.970 --> 02:10.370
And for example, consider two billiard balls having exactly the same properties mass size, color,

02:10.370 --> 02:11.960
etc. and colliding.

02:12.990 --> 02:19.950
This is our everyday experience with the classical mechanical scattering process, which involves hard

02:19.950 --> 02:23.670
and well-defined objects, just chunks of metal.

02:24.720 --> 02:32.250
This collision process could be elastic or inelastic, but that fact is not so relevant to our considerations

02:32.250 --> 02:32.520
here.

02:33.930 --> 02:40.110
In any case, you can follow the path of the particles, billiard balls or the objects or whatever,

02:40.110 --> 02:42.270
and you can find again.

02:43.680 --> 02:52.140
Their whereabouts, if they interact, we can nevertheless distinguish one from the other, for example,

02:52.500 --> 03:01.410
by letting them collide head on, as in this figure here and then observing that the first is scattered

03:01.410 --> 03:05.380
in one direction, while the second is scattered in the other direction.

03:06.150 --> 03:12.420
We can track that trajectory simply by looking down at the billiard table from above.

03:13.590 --> 03:21.960
In the classical view, we determine during the process whether billiard a went along with eye and billiard

03:21.990 --> 03:35.160
B went along path jay or whether to the contrary billiard ball B went along path a while A went along

03:35.160 --> 03:36.150
path J.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.320
It is as simple as that.

03:41.400 --> 03:48.630
So in this Newtonian mechanical perspective, nothing is fundamentally indistinguishable, and if it

03:48.630 --> 03:53.970
is, that is only because we have not looked at the process carefully enough.

03:54.570 --> 03:58.220
In principle, distinguished ability is always possible.

03:58.920 --> 04:04.870
Classical in this distinguished ability is only a notion which reflects our ignorance.

04:04.890 --> 04:07.920
It is not an ontological statement.

04:09.320 --> 04:15.410
If, however, we would like to know what happens during a scattering process between two elementary

04:15.410 --> 04:22.850
particles, say two electrons, we must consider the collision as not like that of two billiard balls

04:23.090 --> 04:25.550
coming in direct contact with each other.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.740
That is touching, so to speak, and repelling each other.

04:31.250 --> 04:38.870
Rather, we must take into account the fact that an electric field surrounds them, a field of forces

04:38.870 --> 04:39.610
surrounds them.

04:41.720 --> 04:48.020
In this case, because the electrons have the same negative electric charge with the same polarity,

04:48.350 --> 04:55.340
they repel each other for tiny charged particles, the scattering never involves direct contact between

04:55.340 --> 04:56.030
particles.

04:56.420 --> 05:04.100
The repulsion, of course, because of the mutual interaction of the extended electric field of both

05:04.100 --> 05:04.850
particles.

05:05.880 --> 05:13.620
Therefore, one must refine the previous mechanical scattering model with this that kind of scattering

05:13.620 --> 05:15.470
model that we see in this figure here.

05:16.800 --> 05:26.190
The trajectories are the aviation path caused by the mutual interaction of the two electric fields without

05:26.190 --> 05:32.820
the particle having any direct contact, at least not in the classical mechanical sense of which we

05:32.820 --> 05:35.160
are accustomed to think of.

05:37.050 --> 05:44.610
Keep in mind that also at the macroscopic scale, there is no such thing as direct contact as naively

05:44.610 --> 05:47.220
suggested by the previous figure.

05:48.070 --> 05:54.640
Every interaction, contact and scattering between material bodies, including that of billiard balls,

05:55.030 --> 06:03.490
is microscopically an electric repulsion between the electron clouds of the atoms and the molecules

06:03.490 --> 06:05.110
of which a body is made of.

06:06.070 --> 06:12.400
In our everyday lives, we perceive the existence of hard objects like stones.

06:14.260 --> 06:24.280
But this hardness boils down to microscopic interactions between particles of the kind of that are depicted

06:24.280 --> 06:25.160
in this figure here.

06:25.750 --> 06:32.710
So in this conception and which is a modern quantum field conception, we must think particles as just

06:32.890 --> 06:41.800
mathematical abstractions point like mathematical points that are surrounded, however, by a force

06:41.800 --> 06:44.230
field and are not.

06:45.630 --> 06:50.700
Marbles or billiard balls, as we would like to believe.

06:52.660 --> 06:59.220
Therefore, as to what regard distinguish ability, things turn out to be a bit more complicated here,

06:59.740 --> 07:07.330
you may have already seen a rather naive assumption we use for the case of the billiard balls to observe

07:07.330 --> 07:08.610
the collision process.

07:08.620 --> 07:15.880
We must have some light in the room which the billiard balls reflect to obtain an image that tells us

07:16.030 --> 07:16.450
which.

07:17.810 --> 07:26.810
Of the two objects went along with Speth at human macroscopic scales, the reflection of photons on

07:26.810 --> 07:32.270
billiard balls is such a tiny perturbation of the system that we can consider it completely negligible

07:33.290 --> 07:34.470
for two electrons.

07:34.490 --> 07:38.220
However, we cannot forget this little photonic perturbation.

07:38.930 --> 07:46.340
Here we are in the domain of Heisenberg's microscope, in the microscopic riam of elementary particles,

07:46.820 --> 07:50.540
the light photons would scatter the particles.

07:50.540 --> 07:57.710
We would like to distinguish and would disturb their trajectories, rendering impossible the kind of

07:57.710 --> 08:01.340
classical distinction process mentioned above that.

08:02.340 --> 08:07.810
Something we have already seen somehow with the microscopic with the microscope, Heisenberg.

08:09.060 --> 08:15.180
However, as we have already mentioned, the perturbation argument is not entirely correct, or at least

08:15.180 --> 08:19.800
it isn't the whole story that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is telling us.

08:20.960 --> 08:27.260
As we will see later, indeed, it is possible to build experimental set ups in which the perturbation

08:27.260 --> 08:35.380
is negligible or even absent, and nevertheless, the uncertainty principle remains unavoidable.

08:36.530 --> 08:41.390
Let us therefore consider a more quantum mechanical version of the whole problem.

08:42.410 --> 08:51.220
Imagine again that the two identical particles say two electrons, A and B, scattered with each other.

08:51.530 --> 08:54.590
Add in this figure and thinking of it.

08:54.590 --> 09:04.580
As with packets, we do not shine in this case, any light particles on them to try to track their whereabouts,

09:04.880 --> 09:06.500
to find out for their path.

09:07.100 --> 09:13.550
So there is no perturbation in the first place and we have not to bother and think about perturbation

09:13.580 --> 09:16.250
the role of the observer or things like that.

09:17.240 --> 09:25.910
Rather, we attempt to distinguish the two cases by detecting one of the particles at a detector here.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.180
We label it with detector deep.

09:29.590 --> 09:35.830
Now, with our Aristotelian intuition, we might think again, like in the previous case of two possible

09:35.830 --> 09:45.250
cases, the two particles scattering at Angel Teeter or at ENGELKE by minus Teater or which means 180

09:45.250 --> 09:46.540
degrees minus detail.

09:46.690 --> 09:56.830
We are using radion units from zero to two pi instead of angle grades from zero degrees to 360 degrees.

09:57.870 --> 10:05.280
We might then be tempted to bring the the ever closer, closer and closer to the small interaction region

10:05.280 --> 10:14.640
called the collision vertex and observe which particle took Path I and which particle took path.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.090
Jay.

10:16.710 --> 10:21.440
Unfortunately, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle prevents us from doing so.

10:22.430 --> 10:30.170
We are not allowed to know what is going on inside this collision vertex as this is a tiny interaction

10:30.170 --> 10:33.170
region where quantum uncertainty reigns.

10:34.100 --> 10:40.370
And because we do not know what happens inside this interaction space, we can't tell which of the two

10:40.370 --> 10:44.150
particles, A or B, hits the detector.

10:44.160 --> 10:44.510
The.

10:46.140 --> 10:53.460
However, all this is not just like shaking a couple of billiard balls in a black box into which we

10:53.460 --> 11:01.870
can't look, as we have clarified while discussing Heisenberg's uncertainty, quantum tunneling and

11:01.870 --> 11:09.090
the superposition principles here, we are not allowed to think of the two particles in this region

11:09.510 --> 11:13.560
as having exact position and momentum at all, not even in principle.

11:14.850 --> 11:25.380
Here, the wavy nature of particles, which must be thought of as to wave packets are no longer negligible,

11:26.100 --> 11:34.200
or, if you prefer, the algebraic standpoint, the computational relations for the position and momentum

11:34.200 --> 11:36.360
operators can no longer be ignored.

11:37.830 --> 11:45.390
The trajectories inside this region cannot be definite particle path, as our naive intuition would

11:45.390 --> 11:46.480
like to consider them.

11:47.550 --> 11:55.640
There is no such thing as a point like particle falling, a precise trajectory, eye or trajectory.

11:55.660 --> 12:05.040
J There are wave packets and which help us to find for the position of particles only by a probabilistic

12:05.040 --> 12:11.670
notion, by taking the model square of that with wavefunction.

12:13.440 --> 12:19.890
What instead becomes important at this case are the diffraction and interference phenomenon between

12:20.160 --> 12:20.970
wave packets.

12:21.540 --> 12:26.370
In quantum mechanics, a certain process is at the fraction of probability waves.

12:27.390 --> 12:31.950
Therefore, we must resort instead to a description with a wave function.

12:32.700 --> 12:40.220
In fact, physicists say that the wave functions overlap and interfere at the collision vertex.

12:41.100 --> 12:48.480
It is this that makes particles indistinguishable in quantum mechanics, not the idea that the observation

12:48.480 --> 12:50.400
as such perturbs the system.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.990
They are not distinguishable, not even in principle.

12:54.540 --> 13:01.140
It is a form of indistinguishable that again, we must carefully avoid confusing with any classical

13:01.140 --> 13:08.820
form of indistinguishable particles are not distinguishable because of our ingredients, say, because

13:08.820 --> 13:16.770
we could not look at the collision vertex with sufficient accuracy here, that they are indistinguishable

13:16.770 --> 13:26.040
because we must understand the two particles as to wave packet's merging and becoming one and only one

13:26.040 --> 13:35.160
whole system without distinctive subparts in the interaction region and which is described by one single

13:35.430 --> 13:36.180
wave function.

13:37.380 --> 13:44.130
Therefore, this figure represents a still somewhat naive understanding of what is really going on in

13:44.130 --> 13:49.110
this area and the previous figures, we considered only a special case Catherine.

13:49.320 --> 13:58.950
And Peter, if, however, we consider all the possible angles occurring in scattering process, we

13:58.950 --> 14:07.820
must build a wavefunction that also has an angular dependence on Twitter that is at the collision vertex.

14:07.860 --> 14:16.380
The two particles must diffract each other in all directions, like a plane wave diffract at an object's

14:16.680 --> 14:17.460
boundaries.

14:18.210 --> 14:25.650
In fact, to simplify the scattering process, consider one of the two interacting particles as a point

14:25.650 --> 14:34.530
like center of wave diffraction, the DOT and this figure here and which is addressed, fixed in the

14:34.530 --> 14:36.600
laboratory reference system.

14:37.740 --> 14:42.660
And consider the other particle as an incoming wave packet.

14:44.190 --> 14:50.850
If we consider the waste packet of the incident particle to be large relative to this point, like the

14:50.850 --> 14:55.950
fraction center it can be represented as an incident plane with.

14:57.140 --> 15:05.390
Then once the plane wave hits the localized region, the local target region, the point like particle,

15:05.810 --> 15:14.420
the resulting wave function involves a superposition of in an incident plane wave and a scattered spherical

15:14.420 --> 15:14.840
wave.

15:16.520 --> 15:20.810
From the perspective of the other particle, the same can be said.

15:21.750 --> 15:31.140
It also will see, so to speak, and incoming front and diffract it into a position of an incoming plane

15:31.140 --> 15:35.070
wave and an outgoing spherical probability wave.

15:36.410 --> 15:42.980
The resultant wave is a more or less complicated outgoing spherical probability wave expanding from

15:42.980 --> 15:51.320
the interaction center towards the outside world until a similar scattering and interaction process,

15:51.530 --> 15:54.290
of course, again with another particle.

15:55.940 --> 16:01.580
This is still a somewhat simplified description of the real gathering process, because in reality,

16:02.090 --> 16:12.560
both particles should be represented as incoming and outgoing wavefront as Anthe Rutherford first introduced

16:12.980 --> 16:19.840
to examine the atomic nucleus, bombarding it with radioactive particles.

16:21.200 --> 16:27.710
And then there is also an even more relativistic correct calculation in.

16:29.680 --> 16:36.190
Which involves a complicated hire or the fireman path, integral formulation and diagrams of quantum

16:36.190 --> 16:40.480
field theory, which we will mention briefly again later.

16:41.640 --> 16:47.580
However, at this point, this should give you at least a qualitative understanding of what quantum

16:47.580 --> 16:56.190
physics interactions and scattering of particles are about, it is about the probability of finding

16:56.400 --> 17:04.500
the scattered particle, which is no longer given by the well-defined path of tiny particles or fields.

17:04.860 --> 17:12.840
But it is determined by a spherical, outwardly expanding probability wave.

17:14.210 --> 17:21.770
Let us see how the situation can be displayed in its temporal evolution and with the detector induced

17:21.770 --> 17:32.270
quantum state reduction first and this figure figure A, we have the two incident wave packets of each

17:32.270 --> 17:42.230
particle capital letter A and B that before any mutual interaction are still distinguishable in space,

17:43.220 --> 17:50.600
what makes them distinguishable are simply their different spatial coordinates, not any inherent property

17:51.020 --> 17:53.150
as they are to electrons.

17:53.150 --> 17:53.870
Exactly.

17:53.870 --> 17:55.820
With exactly the same properties.

17:58.620 --> 18:05.820
In figure B, this figure represents the short time interval during which the two particles interact

18:06.750 --> 18:14.460
here, the two way functions overlap and the individual spatial coordinates of the individual particles

18:14.460 --> 18:16.410
are no longer distinguishable.

18:17.430 --> 18:23.310
The two probability waves deflect and interfere with each other in complicated processes.

18:24.330 --> 18:32.430
The scattering process is represented graphically, simply by a little bubble, so to speak, in space,

18:32.640 --> 18:39.180
which hides the details of the interaction in quantum field theory.

18:39.390 --> 18:47.850
This is also represented by the exchange of virtual particles, as we have discussed earlier, and we

18:47.850 --> 18:51.900
will also see more about that later.

18:54.110 --> 19:01.770
After the collision, what emerges are still not too nicely separated wife packets, but as spherically

19:01.820 --> 19:11.780
shaped shell wavefunction as inefficacy, it is still a two dimensional view for realistic calculations

19:11.780 --> 19:12.980
in three dimensions.

19:13.010 --> 19:21.440
We have catering's in all directions, not only around Circler region, but we have in that case, a

19:21.440 --> 19:22.820
spherical surface.

19:23.600 --> 19:31.520
This would imply another angle dependent's, a solid angle distribution and whose amplitude is modulated

19:31.520 --> 19:36.820
by a function that has an angular dependence in spherical coordinates.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.150
It is also called the scattering amplitude.

19:42.410 --> 19:48.200
However, for the sake of simplicity, we depict here only the two dimensional section.

19:49.850 --> 19:58.430
This spherical probability wave, which is proportional to the square models of the scattering amplitude,

19:58.430 --> 20:07.910
as you know, spreads into outer space according to the particle speed, as long as there is no detection

20:07.910 --> 20:10.970
or any other interaction with other particles.

20:11.420 --> 20:22.040
This spherical wave precedes undisturbed, outwards into space, and no logical inference is allowed

20:22.040 --> 20:25.760
about the particles as distinct entities.

20:26.810 --> 20:32.870
This is because at this stage of the process, there is still nothing like to point like particles,

20:33.590 --> 20:42.020
nor even such a thing as to wave packet's, only a spherical probability wave expanding outwards in

20:42.020 --> 20:42.590
space.

20:43.700 --> 20:51.680
Only when the spherical envelope reaches the detector and when the detector clicks with the wavefunction

20:51.680 --> 20:59.090
function collapse back again, with the spatial localization to a nicely defined spot inside the detector,

20:59.930 --> 21:09.140
say, on a pixel of a camera, and which tells us that they're what we call a particle, must have interacted

21:09.140 --> 21:09.550
with it.

21:10.010 --> 21:16.430
And that is what is depicted in the art, as we shall see later.

21:16.460 --> 21:23.900
And to express it in a more rigorous quantum parlance, decoherence takes place, which causes the projection

21:23.900 --> 21:30.320
of the state vector onto one of its eigenvectors and the respective eigenvalues.

21:31.250 --> 21:38.840
At the same time, the other particle which emerged along the other path must be visualized again with

21:38.840 --> 21:41.780
a wave packet travelling in the opposite direction.

21:43.460 --> 21:50.030
At this point, we no longer have any means of establishing which of the two particles made that detector

21:50.030 --> 21:57.080
click, this is for the simple reason that what emerges from the collision vertex is nothing like two

21:57.080 --> 22:04.760
particles particles at all in the first place, but only one single and Unicol wavefunction spreading

22:04.760 --> 22:12.100
out and waiting to be detected only when the detector clicks with the whole suffer.

22:12.230 --> 22:18.920
This whole quantum hole, so to speak, suffer quantum decoherence and reveal itself again as what we

22:18.920 --> 22:27.620
call two particles, the one showing up at the detector itself and the other possibly even light years

22:27.620 --> 22:33.400
away on the opposite path where we could eventually place another detector as well.

22:35.160 --> 22:42.330
This is something which hints at a holistic interpretation of reality, as everything in physical reality

22:42.330 --> 22:47.910
can be considered a large number of particles continuously interacting with each other.

22:48.630 --> 22:57.240
In addition, those particles that interact that here and now form for a very short instant, an entirely

22:57.240 --> 23:04.980
new system which has no parts as long as the next interaction, of course, and where this whole again

23:04.980 --> 23:07.870
collapses instantly into its particle nature.

23:08.640 --> 23:16.350
And then again forms another indivisible whole system with the new particles they encountered on their

23:16.350 --> 23:16.760
path.

23:17.820 --> 23:23.670
This newly formed wave function temporarily evolves, spreading out until it finds other particles with

23:23.670 --> 23:26.190
which to interact and thereby collapsing again.

23:26.190 --> 23:27.260
And so on and so on.

23:28.550 --> 23:36.470
Another typical place to consider this could be the undistinguishable electrons inside the atoms, we

23:36.470 --> 23:43.400
already saw that modern atomic theory no longer conceives of electrons as moving along precise and well-defined

23:43.400 --> 23:43.880
orbits.

23:44.150 --> 23:47.100
But they must be modelled with the with orbitals.

23:47.960 --> 23:55.010
We should not consider orbitals and therefore atoms as objects made up like a puzzle structure, as

23:55.010 --> 24:00.770
this would again imply that the current constituent puzzle pieces can, in principle, indistinguishable

24:00.770 --> 24:01.510
from each other.

24:02.450 --> 24:09.560
You must instead conceive of atoms as a single complicated function, a probability wave that represents

24:09.560 --> 24:16.730
a whole a single unit which manifests itself in form of distinguishing different parts that electrons,

24:16.730 --> 24:22.730
protons and neutrons only at the instant of interaction or observation, but not before that.

24:24.320 --> 24:32.240
If all this really is about quantum holism or is an abstraction that emerges from the mathematical formalism,

24:32.600 --> 24:35.090
is a question difficult to answer.

24:35.660 --> 24:42.650
This representation of a scattering process and the quantum indistinguishable of parts of a quantum

24:42.650 --> 24:46.610
system is indeed a holistic representation.

24:47.630 --> 24:56.000
But fact is that at the end of the story, we always and only observe point like interactions in space

24:56.000 --> 25:01.010
and time as the objects that we are observing.

25:02.410 --> 25:10.540
Would be particles, what we are observing behaves like particles, never spherical wavefunction spreading

25:10.540 --> 25:10.870
out.

25:11.770 --> 25:18.700
So this is a subtle matter of debate and philosophical speculation, however.

25:20.390 --> 25:27.350
Going on with our lectures, we will see how this holistic aspect of reality will emerge over and over

25:27.350 --> 25:27.830
again.

25:29.700 --> 25:39.690
He instead to go somewhat further in our understanding about the shattering process and the indistinguishably,

25:40.020 --> 25:43.860
let us proceed with a bit more formal analysis.

25:45.120 --> 25:50.250
We have seen how particles can be in a spin up, down and spin down.

25:50.250 --> 25:58.890
State opposition states in superposition for a single particle are described by a state vector as a

25:58.890 --> 26:01.530
some of the possible igan states.

26:02.010 --> 26:09.870
As, for instance, here in our case, all good, all spin up and spin down states for a single particle.

26:10.880 --> 26:15.830
What about the quantum superposition state of more than one particle?

26:17.350 --> 26:24.250
The answer is that the Wetterstedt of a system of many particles is no longer described by the Sun,

26:24.250 --> 26:32.080
but by the product of the possible Agon states of each particle scattering processes lend themselves

26:32.080 --> 26:33.840
quite well to illustrate this.

26:34.090 --> 26:39.220
In fact, in a similar manner, we can also describe a superposition of scattering states.

26:40.210 --> 26:47.770
To see this, let us return to the previous picture of the scattering process that we already saw and.

26:49.110 --> 27:00.630
Consider here particle a capital letter, A which follows Path I as being instead a cat I.

27:01.820 --> 27:10.610
And the other particle be following path, Jay, as being in State B kept Jay.

27:12.540 --> 27:23.010
Then we can represent the state vector of this system as the product of two states, namely as a kid,

27:23.010 --> 27:25.770
I times B kid J.

27:27.890 --> 27:36.020
The same goes for the other situation in which particle a follow CSJ, therefore, as being in state

27:36.170 --> 27:46.070
A cat and particle B, which goes a long path I as being in state B cat I.

27:48.540 --> 27:54.930
Then the overall state vector is again here and for the second case, a cat, Jay.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.100
Times be good, I.

28:00.000 --> 28:07.530
However, this cannot be the whole story, because if the quantum state algebra, this quantum state

28:07.530 --> 28:16.890
algebra would be correct, this would still allow us for distinguish ability as even for identical particles,

28:17.100 --> 28:24.180
the formalism this formalism distinguishes between the two cases in which particle went along, which

28:24.180 --> 28:24.600
path.

28:25.590 --> 28:30.930
In this sort of quantum algebra, a classical indistinguishable is still encoded.

28:31.620 --> 28:38.090
A real quantum indistinguishably must also take into account the superposition principle.

28:39.030 --> 28:47.070
Hence we must allow also for our intuitive understanding of the quite disturbing eventuality that each

28:47.070 --> 28:51.300
particle travels both paths at the same time.

28:53.110 --> 29:02.140
That is the state vector of the whole system must describe both particles travelling both pairs at the

29:02.140 --> 29:07.120
same time, and this is given by the sum of subtraction.

29:07.130 --> 29:10.280
And then we will see now later why subtraction.

29:10.300 --> 29:13.990
But for now, just take it as it is.

29:15.010 --> 29:18.970
This is given by the sum or subtraction of the two possible states.

29:18.970 --> 29:27.430
Above that is, we have the state vector overall state vector capsid, which is equal one over square

29:27.430 --> 29:33.880
root, two times the sum of the two states that we have described here above.

29:35.710 --> 29:41.200
The square root of two is simply a normalization factor that stands for the probability coefficient

29:41.350 --> 29:48.530
that we or you should know now by what what it really means in which the model of square represents

29:48.530 --> 29:51.690
the probability of getting the first or second case.

29:51.700 --> 29:58.150
That is that model, the square of one of the square root, two is equal, one half that is zero point

29:58.150 --> 30:06.100
five, which means 50 percent, 50 50 percent chance of getting the first or second case each.

30:07.930 --> 30:14.020
Now the plus minus sign corresponds to two different particles, a positive, symmetric way function

30:14.650 --> 30:15.730
for bosons.

30:15.730 --> 30:24.430
As we know, particles like photons with internal spin as equals zero, one, two, etc. and a negative

30:24.430 --> 30:32.890
anti-Semitic wave function for fermions particles like electrons, protons and neutrons, etc. with

30:33.040 --> 30:39.310
half odd integrase spin as equal one half, three 1/2, five five and so on.

30:40.330 --> 30:44.320
We will discuss the meaning of the negative sign later in detail.

30:44.740 --> 30:47.560
Please accept this little ambiguity for now.

30:49.940 --> 30:57.590
So we have taken two steps, first, we are presenting a system of two particles, taking one or the

30:57.590 --> 31:01.400
other path as a product of their respective states.

31:02.630 --> 31:10.040
Then we added or subtracted the two states as a superposition superposition of two possible scattering

31:10.040 --> 31:10.540
states.

31:10.550 --> 31:17.440
That is, the particles taking both one and the other path at the same time.

31:19.170 --> 31:23.200
By doing so, any notion of distinguished ability fades away.

31:23.850 --> 31:31.380
Not only is it impossible to distinguish the two electrons after the scattering process, but the question

31:31.380 --> 31:36.330
no longer makes sense if both electrons travel along both pairs.

31:36.330 --> 31:45.180
At the same time, the single electron measured at Detector D is simply another entity that emerges

31:45.180 --> 31:49.650
from the collision vertex, which is a spherical wave function that we have seen.

31:50.220 --> 31:57.960
What detector the measures is a particle which of course preserves exactly the same properties of the

31:57.960 --> 32:02.910
incident once, but can no longer be considered either B or B.

32:04.090 --> 32:13.450
Or maybe A and B are the same very same Electrum again, quantum physics reminds us that any logical

32:13.690 --> 32:21.260
reintroduction implies counterfactual definiteness is a bad habit of the human mind.

32:22.330 --> 32:24.940
This is the real quantum indistinguishably.

32:25.600 --> 32:29.290
It is just another form of quantum superposition.

32:31.040 --> 32:37.970
One might ask at this point, why should we take the above mentioned second step, that of superposition

32:37.970 --> 32:39.600
of certain states seriously?

32:40.220 --> 32:47.480
After all, it offends our common sense to consider that particles travel distinct paths at the same

32:47.480 --> 32:47.910
time.

32:48.890 --> 32:58.130
Can we not simply skip that passage and ride the state vector as the two products separately and be

32:58.130 --> 32:59.210
happy with that?

33:00.710 --> 33:07.460
The proof that nature instead insists on taking superposition seriously is an expert in experimental

33:07.460 --> 33:13.640
proof, you will be able to predict the correct scattering rate as well as the probabilities of how

33:13.640 --> 33:21.800
the electrons are deflected over all the possible angles, data and that are empirically observed with

33:21.800 --> 33:23.170
laboratory experiments.

33:23.870 --> 33:31.220
If and only if the calculations are done with a wave functions, that takes the two products states

33:31.970 --> 33:35.060
as a sum or subtraction of each other.

33:35.720 --> 33:42.080
Any other description from mathematical description fails to describe reality.

33:43.750 --> 33:50.260
In conclusion, generally speaking, what we must bear in mind is that indistinguishably does not emerge

33:50.260 --> 33:54.550
because of our ignorance or the imprecision of the measurement devices.

33:55.180 --> 34:00.520
Nature insists on the indistinguishable quantum version at all costs.

34:01.090 --> 34:06.820
There is no perturbation effect or measurement in precision preventing us from distinguishing between

34:06.820 --> 34:07.080
them.

34:07.630 --> 34:13.370
Rather, quantum indistinguishable emerges due to the superposition of possibilities.

34:14.350 --> 34:21.340
The simple fact is that there is nothing to distinguish and there are no differentiated parts to differentiate

34:21.340 --> 34:22.290
in the first place.

34:23.480 --> 34:30.500
This is the base, the conceptual foundation of a closely related phenomenon that has puzzled and that

34:30.500 --> 34:38.930
continues to puzzle so many bright minds and upon which we will now build in the coming lecture's the

34:38.930 --> 34:41.690
phenomenon of quantum entanglement.
