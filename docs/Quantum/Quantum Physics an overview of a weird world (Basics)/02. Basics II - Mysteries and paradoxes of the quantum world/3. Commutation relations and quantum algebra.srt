00:00.830 --> 00:07.940
Now that we have become accustomed with the concept of angular momentum, intrinsic angular momentum

00:07.940 --> 00:18.740
of a particle point particle, that is the spin and know how these physical quantities can be measured

00:18.740 --> 00:28.490
with D'Angela experiment and can be described with some simple Dirac connotation, it is time then to

00:28.490 --> 00:35.810
analyze better the physical properties that result from the spin of particles and how these properties

00:35.960 --> 00:40.410
then are encoded into an algebraic language.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.080
To illustrate this, consider first these figures.

00:46.520 --> 00:56.000
These pictures, this grass which depict in form of a block diagram the stangl device for the two possible

00:56.120 --> 00:58.660
quantized measurement outcomes.

00:59.930 --> 01:09.170
Here you see the saurus sense spin plus minus one half particles, saiz silver atoms or electrons or

01:09.170 --> 01:12.020
whatever towards an estimate.

01:12.020 --> 01:16.880
That device, which means a Garlock that measures along.

01:16.880 --> 01:27.590
There's the measures, the spin along that Z axis is the electron is in that get plus or that get minus

01:27.590 --> 01:36.800
spin and state it will be deviated towards the upper or lower part of the apparatus respectively.

01:39.510 --> 01:46.980
Let us begin with a story that measurement outcome of the spin up electronic and construct in different

01:46.980 --> 01:54.540
steps, the experimental procedure now we know just speak of electrons just to speak about quantum particles.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.000
But let's think of electrons.

01:58.200 --> 01:59.730
Begin with this diagram.

02:00.710 --> 02:11.090
Physicist, speak of a system here, just a single particle prepared in the that Kate Plus Eigen state.

02:13.080 --> 02:22.950
However, we are good experimentalists and want to be absolutely sure that when the electron went through

02:22.970 --> 02:31.500
the asset, that device it stayed was not destroyed by the measurement itself and that it is still in

02:31.500 --> 02:32.750
the that cat.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.410
Plus I can state that.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.930
And to do that, what what can we do?

02:39.960 --> 02:49.170
We simply cascade another another S.G. that device, that is another stangl like device that again measures

02:49.170 --> 02:55.740
along the same direction, in this case, that Z direction as in measurement be.

02:56.590 --> 03:05.890
If we made no mistakes and our laboratory equipment worked fine, one would again observe the electron

03:05.890 --> 03:10.630
coming out of the corresponding plus plus that output.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.990
This is an experimental fact.

03:14.980 --> 03:21.550
So we are sure that the measurement as such does not destroy the electrons intrinsic angular momentum

03:22.240 --> 03:23.920
along the Z axis.

03:25.000 --> 03:34.210
We feel therefore authorized to say that in fact the electron is in that particular spin up I can state.

03:36.070 --> 03:42.710
However, the quantum world is a bit weird world, and things are not as easy as that.

03:43.840 --> 03:48.880
To demonstrate this, let us extend our measurements along other directions.

03:50.560 --> 03:58.900
Consider measurements, see as in this figure here, here, we first select again the electron with

04:00.340 --> 04:07.270
that along that direction, and that is we prepare the system in the.

04:08.510 --> 04:10.010
Said Kate Plus.

04:11.930 --> 04:19.880
I can state so therefore, our electron has spin up along that direction with the first S.G., that

04:19.880 --> 04:28.010
device, which measure measures the spin along that tracks and then sends it through another stangl

04:28.160 --> 04:28.620
device.

04:28.640 --> 04:38.390
But this time it measures not along that the headset, but along the x axis, the spinning perpendicular

04:38.720 --> 04:39.680
x axis.

04:40.190 --> 04:46.610
Therefore, we know what we do is that we put together.

04:48.160 --> 04:53.860
Kaskade, the GST, that was the SGX device.

04:55.580 --> 05:03.350
And therefore, one measures the spin along the X axis, to do that, one has only to appropriately

05:03.350 --> 05:06.450
rotate the S.G. device magnets.

05:06.470 --> 05:08.420
Think about how it is constructed.

05:10.480 --> 05:21.640
What will be observed as output from the letter is from the letters last stand, Garlock is SGX device,

05:21.880 --> 05:26.620
is that both spin XIENG states will show up.

05:27.550 --> 05:34.540
That is, if you send several electrons through such a system of cascaded S.G. devices, you will have

05:34.540 --> 05:42.940
a 50 percent, 50 percent chance of seeing it come out in a spin up and 50 percent chance of seeing

05:42.940 --> 05:46.630
it in a spin down again state always.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.370
This is something we can measure empirically with experiments.

05:53.390 --> 06:00.290
Initially, you might have no problem with that, we may simply believe that of all the particles initially

06:00.290 --> 06:11.870
prepared in the state, that plus Kate plus I can state 50 percent of them have an X, Kate plus spin

06:11.870 --> 06:20.990
state I can state while the other 50 percent I am minus X X minus X minus except minus spin.

06:22.950 --> 06:28.800
After all, we are dealing with two different spin directions that we think of as being independent

06:28.800 --> 06:35.940
from each other, so their principal issue, I think there is no problem for our conventional classical

06:35.970 --> 06:36.530
logic.

06:36.690 --> 06:44.640
It sounds entirely legitimate to state that in preparing the system in the first stage along the Z axis

06:44.790 --> 06:55.050
as a plus particle spin plus a particle without caring in what state it is along the X axis, it makes

06:55.050 --> 07:08.160
sense that statistically we obtain 50 percent of the X Keat plus and X get minus particles at the end

07:08.160 --> 07:08.790
of the chain.

07:10.500 --> 07:18.450
And if our dangle like device is our idea and do not destroy the Igan states during any measurement

07:18.450 --> 07:26.490
processes, we might effectively, effectively consider the electron that spins along the Z axis to

07:26.490 --> 07:34.950
really be in a spin up state and along that axis, and there is no reason to believe otherwise.

07:36.480 --> 07:44.040
This interpretation, however, will not hold up because the experimental evidence evidence will show

07:44.040 --> 07:45.150
us otherwise.

07:45.510 --> 07:53.850
In fact, we are scientists who want to be very cautious and maintain absolute certainty that the intrinsic

07:53.850 --> 07:57.530
angular momentum along the Z axis is still there.

07:59.990 --> 08:03.110
Therefore, we again now.

08:04.540 --> 08:13.330
Append another S.G. device, this time along the that axis, we again measure the spin along the Z axis

08:13.510 --> 08:22.060
of one of the outcoming particles of the measurement see say that will spin up right in the X, Kate

08:22.090 --> 08:23.140
plus eight instead.

08:23.860 --> 08:31.090
And we cascade another as that device, which measures measures a spin along that direction.

08:31.090 --> 08:35.080
Again, as shown in this figure here of measurement, the.

08:36.720 --> 08:43.690
What we will discover is now that the particles spin up against state along the Z axis is gone.

08:44.490 --> 08:53.910
It is no longer determinate and becomes uncertain because again, sending many electrons, we have a

08:53.910 --> 08:57.770
50 percent chance of getting the spin up or spin down state.

08:59.250 --> 09:02.640
So it seems that along that axis, everything has been.

09:03.800 --> 09:04.760
Mixed up again.

09:06.410 --> 09:11.600
If you are not surprised about that, almost certainly you did not get the point.

09:11.630 --> 09:19.220
So please go over the whole thing again, because for our classical understanding of the world, this

09:19.220 --> 09:21.830
is a complete contradiction in measurement.

09:21.830 --> 09:22.310
Be.

09:23.280 --> 09:31.200
Didn't we twice measure that spin to ensure that the measurement did not destroy a particles intrinsic

09:31.200 --> 09:32.080
angular momentum?

09:33.750 --> 09:42.720
We can repeat the same experiment of measurement B with such as that S.G. X device cascading another

09:43.800 --> 09:51.480
X, and we won't see any destructive activity along the X axis either.

09:52.710 --> 10:01.800
If applied twice, it won't disturb the system, and yet if we first measure the spin along the Z axis

10:01.800 --> 10:07.260
and along the X axis, we see that nature does not allow for that.

10:08.610 --> 10:17.910
And by the way, if one would make the same experiments along the y axis and or in all its possible

10:17.910 --> 10:20.220
combinations, the result will not change.

10:21.780 --> 10:28.800
What all this tells us is that we cannot know at the same time the value of the spin along to Axis.

10:29.820 --> 10:36.270
And again, this is independent from any interaction between the measuring apparatus and the particle.

10:37.200 --> 10:44.010
It is important to keep in mind that this has nothing to do with the interaction between the observing

10:44.010 --> 10:52.310
device and the observed object and even less with the supposed mind or consciousness of a human observer.

10:53.510 --> 11:01.850
So does this remind you perhaps something it should, because here we have again a phenomenon which

11:01.850 --> 11:05.680
is strongly reminiscent of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

11:06.890 --> 11:10.790
In that case, the position and momentum were indeterminate.

11:11.570 --> 11:13.820
There could not be measured at the same time.

11:14.870 --> 11:22.620
Here they are, the spin's in the case of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

11:23.090 --> 11:31.310
This is expressed with the position and momentum operators here, the spin operators along three directions

11:31.310 --> 11:32.180
coming to the play.

11:33.780 --> 11:37.970
However, the underlying principle is of the very same nature.

11:39.020 --> 11:46.880
Namely, that the precise knowledge of one observable seems to be incompatible with certain knowledge

11:46.880 --> 11:48.470
of another observable.

11:49.890 --> 11:57.360
Once you measure one dynamic variable, you are no longer allowed to extrapolate anything about the

11:57.360 --> 12:05.040
state of the previous one in general, once a measurement prepares a quantum system in a specific igan

12:05.040 --> 12:12.470
state, that is, it projects the state better sign on to one of its igan basis vectors.

12:13.080 --> 12:20.120
Uh, X squared plus minus or Y get plus minus or that get plus minus.

12:20.730 --> 12:29.280
Then it also renders indeterminate the outcome associated with the other two igan states.

12:31.950 --> 12:39.570
This automatically implies that the order in which the measurement is performed is important, is very

12:39.570 --> 12:40.200
important.

12:40.490 --> 12:50.850
It is not you cannot just change the order of the measurement without a potential possible effect on

12:50.850 --> 12:54.000
it independently from the.

12:54.930 --> 13:01.950
Interaction of the measurement apparatus of the measure with the measured object.

13:03.240 --> 13:11.700
Performing a measurement on a quantum system, first with the observable as X, for example, and then

13:11.820 --> 13:21.660
with that will not lead to the same result as that stemming from performing it first with the observable

13:21.660 --> 13:23.790
as that and then as X.

13:25.470 --> 13:34.410
This is because in the former case, the system is projected, say, in can state X plus X squared plus

13:34.410 --> 13:36.180
with that.

13:37.860 --> 13:45.840
Kate, plus minus and why, Kate, plus minus uncertain why in the latter case, the system is projected,

13:45.840 --> 13:48.980
say, in Oregon State that Kate Black.

13:49.260 --> 13:56.190
Plus with nothing that can be said about the ex plus minus, Kate plus minus.

13:56.190 --> 14:01.410
And why Kate plus minus eight states in sign bulls.

14:02.070 --> 14:11.770
This means that if we first operate with the appropriate asset on the state, function on the hour,

14:11.820 --> 14:14.580
I better get my.

14:15.820 --> 14:25.030
And then operate with as X, which means apply the stone Gerlach device along the Z direction and then

14:25.390 --> 14:27.220
along the X direction.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.600
This is not the same time.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.990
This is not equal to applying.

14:31.990 --> 14:38.380
First, the ASX operator and then the asset operator on the.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.770
Same initial state capsid.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.870
Or just.

14:46.840 --> 14:55.300
Rewriting the same equation, you bring the right hand side of this equation on the left hand side,

14:55.660 --> 15:06.550
you have this simple algebraic expression which tells us that in parenthesis as X times as that, minus

15:06.550 --> 15:10.720
as that as X operating on the.

15:11.800 --> 15:17.320
GABSI does not give the result.

15:18.890 --> 15:28.730
The same applies to the other spin operator combinations such as as X, Y and S, Y and Z, physicists

15:28.730 --> 15:33.320
and mathematicians say that the observables do not commute.

15:35.030 --> 15:42.590
And express this, formerly, it was a former expression with the so-called commutation relation.

15:43.620 --> 15:52.200
Written with a square square brackets, the commentators, that is for two generic generic operators,

15:52.590 --> 16:01.230
a cap and B cap, the caps are symbols to distinguish operators from numbers that is scholars or vector

16:01.230 --> 16:06.120
quantities from operate as operators from Scotland back to quantities.

16:08.280 --> 16:12.930
The commentator is defined as connotation a cap.

16:13.410 --> 16:16.080
B cap equal a cap.

16:16.260 --> 16:18.840
B cap minus B cap a cap.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.120
For example.

16:20.760 --> 16:33.030
Here commentator ASX asset equals ASX asset minus asset ASX and so on is just an algebraic way to write

16:33.030 --> 16:37.500
the same thing that we have explained above.

16:37.770 --> 16:45.390
So when observables do not commute, this simply means that we can't know them both at the same time

16:45.840 --> 16:52.050
and formally that computation relations do not commit.

16:53.640 --> 17:02.610
The observers do not commute without going into too much into the algebraic details which would go beyond

17:02.610 --> 17:04.560
the scope of this.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.630
Of course it can be sure.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.300
Let us only.

17:10.380 --> 17:17.850
Say, hint, the fact that it can be shown that the spin commentators obey the following following rules,

17:18.900 --> 17:31.050
the commentators of the ASX as that observer gives a quantity, I imagine that now in no age bar.

17:32.250 --> 17:37.500
The plank's constant divide, two pi times the.

17:40.230 --> 17:49.560
Spin operator along the way axis as why the same thing commutator of X, Y and Z is equal I, h, bar

17:49.920 --> 17:56.760
X and X and the commentator of X and Y spin operators is equal.

17:57.840 --> 18:06.330
I imagine there is no age bar as that, so you see that these operators are interchangeable in this

18:08.430 --> 18:18.990
algebra, so to speak, it what this means is a bit because, again, a bit more beyond the scope of

18:18.990 --> 18:19.620
this course.

18:19.620 --> 18:28.110
But simply it is important to remember that simply these commentators do not give a zero result.

18:28.530 --> 18:30.450
They give something else.

18:32.580 --> 18:42.840
This allows us also to formally formulate Heisenberg's uncertainty principle itself, in the case of

18:42.840 --> 18:48.660
the uncertainty principle, the position and momentum operators do not commute because as we know,

18:48.690 --> 18:54.580
only one or the other observable, but not both can be determined with high precision.

18:55.200 --> 19:02.010
One can show that if one applies the position and momentum operators consecutively on the wavefunction,

19:02.490 --> 19:05.070
one will not obtain the zero result.

19:06.680 --> 19:07.370
But again.

19:08.290 --> 19:16.810
A quantity, which is the imaginary number times the Planck's constant, the bar divided to by.

19:17.910 --> 19:24.270
Therefore, formally, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is stated by the computational relation for

19:24.270 --> 19:29.300
the position momentum observables in a three dimensional space as given the year.

19:29.850 --> 19:34.840
So it's very similar to the spin operators.

19:35.490 --> 19:46.950
But here we have the position and the momentum operator X and P or X, Y, Z and B, X, Y, Z, because

19:46.950 --> 19:49.560
we are considering the three axis and the three dimensions.

19:49.950 --> 20:00.720
And the commentators of these two operators give again something which is not a zero Skoller number,

20:00.720 --> 20:04.830
but here a number, the imaginary number of times each bar.

20:06.330 --> 20:17.880
Again, because this is a formal way to say you cannot you are not allowed to measure at the same time

20:18.180 --> 20:25.470
the two observables, if you try to do that, things become fuzzy and your.

20:26.870 --> 20:34.980
Values of your observations will become smeared out, so to speak.

20:36.370 --> 20:42.010
Therefore, very in general, it is important to keep in mind the meaning of the commutation relations

20:42.010 --> 20:50.010
and what visitors mean when they speak about observables that do not commute the nonzero nonzero commutation

20:50.020 --> 20:57.790
relations, expressing the impossibility of establishing the value of two observables at the same time

20:58.330 --> 21:02.500
is one of the most fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.

21:03.790 --> 21:11.370
This is also the former mathematical expression of what is called the Borse complimentarity principle

21:12.460 --> 21:20.260
when observables exists that we cannot know precisely at the same time they are complementary to each

21:20.260 --> 21:20.610
other.

21:21.310 --> 21:24.250
That's for both complimentarity principle.

21:25.930 --> 21:32.890
However, this does not mean that observables never commute, there are observables that commute.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.290
That is the commentator.

21:34.540 --> 21:37.370
Computational relations result is zero.

21:38.710 --> 21:44.820
This is the case when one measurement does not render the previous one uncertain.

21:45.370 --> 21:51.280
You measure make two different measurements and there nothing becomes uncertain for that.

21:52.360 --> 21:56.300
This is always the case with one observable with itself.

21:56.900 --> 22:01.970
Now, we have already seen that, which is to say that same measure is made twice.

22:02.560 --> 22:09.850
For instance, what we saw in the case B and this means that as the commutation or relation of as that

22:10.870 --> 22:14.140
is equal to zero, quite obvious fact.

22:15.490 --> 22:22.990
Otherwise we could not speak of igan states as states of a quantum system in the first place, states

22:22.990 --> 22:28.260
and of quantum system in which a repeated measurement always provides the same answer.

22:29.020 --> 22:33.820
I hope you get now the logic that stands behind all of this formalism.

22:34.750 --> 22:44.770
Another example is that space operators, uh, for example, ex commentator x y is equal to zero, which

22:44.770 --> 22:53.800
means that quantum mechanics allows for simultaneous determination of a particle position along the

22:53.800 --> 22:55.330
three space axis.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.600
Contrary to the case with the spin.

22:59.780 --> 23:11.000
That's also why we must distinguish carefully the so-called spin space state, which is just a mathematical

23:11.000 --> 23:22.520
algebraic notion from the position space, space, space states of a particle in three dimensional space.

23:26.530 --> 23:35.800
What we have seen so far is one of the basic relations of the so called quantum algebra, it differs

23:35.800 --> 23:43.750
from classical algebra because in the quantum world, the order of the product terms is no longer arbitrary

23:44.230 --> 23:50.070
in classical physics or classical mathematics, if you wish to put it in there.

23:50.080 --> 23:57.000
In that way, it is normal to think of numbers following commutative laws, for example.

23:57.190 --> 24:05.740
No one would doubt that two times three equals six is the same as saying that three times two is also

24:05.740 --> 24:06.190
six.

24:07.200 --> 24:14.370
Not so in quantum mechanics, that is why in quantum mechanics, physicists and mathematicians were

24:14.370 --> 24:21.420
forced to consider a completely new quantum algebra in a Hilbert space that is very different from the

24:21.420 --> 24:26.550
math, describing classical Newtonian physics in standard real space.

24:27.690 --> 24:33.660
The main difference is that in quantum mechanics, the objects of this algebra describing the dynamical

24:33.660 --> 24:42.120
variables are no longer numbers or classical variables, but observables mathematical operators acting

24:42.120 --> 24:44.640
on a complex wave function or state vector.

24:46.140 --> 24:52.890
For this reason, they are sometimes also sometimes also called queue numbers, these patterns, instead

24:52.890 --> 25:02.100
of the scene numbers, classical numbers, quantum numbers, classical numbers, despite not being numbers

25:02.100 --> 25:02.490
at all.

25:03.780 --> 25:10.740
This also answers the answer to the question of how physicists got to that strange and so fundamentally

25:10.740 --> 25:18.660
different form of description compared to classical physics by taking them, by taking measurements

25:18.660 --> 25:19.950
in the quantum domain.

25:20.830 --> 25:28.120
Physicists were first led to formulate new laws, which they later encoded into a formal language,

25:28.690 --> 25:30.080
not the other way around.

25:31.300 --> 25:38.140
It is true that this quantum algebra was developed by great physicists and mathematicians in the 1920s

25:38.140 --> 25:47.200
and 1930s, like John Norman, Erwin Schrodinger, then Heisenberg, McSporran, Paul Dirac and several

25:47.200 --> 25:51.760
others, and has today reached a high level of sophistication.

25:53.170 --> 26:00.760
However, its inception came into being not because of the application of common sense and logical rules,

26:01.600 --> 26:04.840
but because of rock solid evidence.

26:05.410 --> 26:14.830
Empiric experimental evidence of what the Garlock experiments have shown, as well as of other empirical

26:14.830 --> 26:16.120
evidence of, of course.

26:17.810 --> 26:25.060
Nature imposed it on us, the impossibility of establishing the value of two different quantum dynamic,

26:25.070 --> 26:32.120
dynamic variables like to spin orientation, the orientation of an for for example, for an electron

26:32.600 --> 26:35.750
is not a logical consequence of some phenomenon.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.590
It is a given fact that has no classical parallel.

26:39.830 --> 26:44.340
And even though classical logical reason to be it is as it is.

26:45.570 --> 26:54.470
That's also why several textbooks entirely skip and ignore the S.G. experiments and posit instead as

26:54.470 --> 27:06.950
basic axioms and approach that, if I may say Fev to me feels pedagogically detrimental because it skips

27:07.160 --> 27:13.760
the conceptual physics standing behind it and presents quantum mechanics as nothing more than a mathematical

27:13.760 --> 27:14.480
exercise.

27:15.730 --> 27:25.030
At any rate, the great service of Stann and Gala was not just that of measuring the magnetic momentum

27:25.030 --> 27:32.200
of a silver atom, but that of disclosing a weird quantum physical world to us, as well as that of

27:32.200 --> 27:39.490
opening the way to a huge mathematical development which turned out to be extremely useful and which

27:39.490 --> 27:43.300
is being theoretical and practical for it to this day.
