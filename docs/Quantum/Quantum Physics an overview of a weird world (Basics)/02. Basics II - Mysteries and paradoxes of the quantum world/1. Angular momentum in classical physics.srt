00:00.730 --> 00:09.250
Before focusing on the mysteries and paradoxes of the quantum world, we must learn a couple of elementary

00:09.250 --> 00:19.180
concepts such as momentum and spin, angular momentum and spin that we will find throughout the rest

00:19.180 --> 00:20.230
of this course.

00:21.740 --> 00:29.210
And again, please distinguish between momentum, angular momentum and the kinetic energy, kinetic

00:29.210 --> 00:35.810
energy is something quite different and check out if you don't know the difference.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.850
Check out the brief lecture that you will find in the appendix.

00:42.510 --> 00:46.950
So what is angular momentum in classical physics?

00:47.130 --> 00:49.550
It is not very hard to understand it.

00:50.100 --> 01:00.240
It is the amount of rotational momentum, the quantity of motion of rotating bodies, such a particle

01:00.240 --> 01:05.790
flying around an orbital center like in the left figure here.

01:07.420 --> 01:17.950
Or the amount of rotational motion of an extended object spinning around its own axis, which could

01:17.950 --> 01:24.190
be, for example, the Earth or that of a more complex object, that could be a spinning top.

01:25.400 --> 01:33.050
And these material bodies could spin faster or slower and could be more or less massive, which means

01:33.050 --> 01:40.040
contain more metal, and therefore we used to say that they have more or less angular momentum.

01:41.600 --> 01:49.790
Let us first look at the notion of the angular momentum of a single particle rotating around the center

01:50.360 --> 01:55.430
as shown diagrammatically with the diagram with vectors in this figure.

01:57.610 --> 02:05.860
Recall how the linear momentum of a particle which moves unperturbed, which means linear means in which

02:06.040 --> 02:08.960
it moves unperturbed along a straight path.

02:09.970 --> 02:19.870
This is proportional to the product of its mass m times the velocity we at least in non relativistic

02:20.140 --> 02:25.540
classical mechanics and which is P equals M Times v..

02:27.400 --> 02:28.150
Similarly.

02:29.090 --> 02:37.400
The general expression of the angular momentum l l with capital letters of a particle with rotation

02:37.400 --> 02:43.130
velocity of about an origin is defined as l equal.

02:43.990 --> 02:46.840
Our gross product P.

02:47.880 --> 02:59.340
Which means our gross product and times we ve where we are is a position vector of the particle relative

02:59.340 --> 03:07.200
to the rotational origin and the cross, this cross here denotes the vector across product, a sort

03:07.200 --> 03:13.620
of multiplication for vectors, which is not so extremely relevant now for us.

03:13.670 --> 03:24.290
Yeah, but it's just to tell you that you have to multiply in some way vectors with scholars, scholars,

03:24.300 --> 03:36.420
which means only numbers like math and vectors like that position or vector R and velocity vector V.

03:38.230 --> 03:46.450
Please note that both the linnear and the angular momentum are vectors vector quantity, so which means

03:46.450 --> 03:49.200
they have a magnitude and direction.

03:50.080 --> 03:55.300
In fact, usually we letters representing vectors are written with an arrow.

03:56.990 --> 04:06.920
Above it or in bold, here, we use the name, the letter and the bold style Symbolics.

04:08.790 --> 04:14.940
Now, what about extended bodies made of several particles, not just one?

04:17.580 --> 04:27.000
In the event of a body made of GNR particles rotating around a center is external to itself that is

04:27.150 --> 04:29.850
orbiting around a center of origin.

04:30.990 --> 04:42.540
The so-called orbital angular momentum, which is written capital or arbiter, can be obtained by determining

04:42.990 --> 04:52.290
that some of the linear momentum of each of its constituent particles sum over all the particles of

04:52.290 --> 04:57.660
masses, M-I times the respective rotation and velocity.

04:57.870 --> 05:08.730
V.I. for each of it as an orbital equals the sum from equal one to N, and the number of particles of

05:09.330 --> 05:15.330
which the body is made are high, which is again a vector cross product.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.580
My times v i.

05:18.990 --> 05:30.300
Where the index eye is, the index of the ice particles and our our eye is ice particles distance from

05:30.300 --> 05:32.550
that axis and any.

05:33.630 --> 05:42.360
As the number of particles, it is just the same formula as above, only indexed by a day by a number

05:42.480 --> 05:50.580
parameter I in this case, however, an extended body can also rotate around itself.

05:51.540 --> 05:58.830
A typical example is that of the Earth, which not only orbits around the sun, but, as everybody knows,

05:58.830 --> 06:06.360
spins once around its polar axis approximately every 24 hours.

06:08.120 --> 06:15.500
In this case, four bodies whose interior have a complex, mass disparate distribution like the Earth,

06:15.770 --> 06:23.570
the density distribution inside the earth can be quite complicated and one must calculate the so-called

06:23.570 --> 06:25.970
moment of inertia of a body.

06:27.560 --> 06:37.580
Inertia is a physical quantity that measure measures the resistance and material body exerts upon a

06:37.580 --> 06:38.810
change of motion.

06:40.050 --> 06:47.700
In the case of just off a point particle, it is simply it's mass, the mass is, in fact in physics

06:47.970 --> 06:50.130
mass of particles.

06:50.130 --> 06:57.480
The mass of the particle is just defined as a resistance to a change of motion.

06:57.670 --> 07:06.450
If one can define it as such, in the case of a body with an extension and a more or less irregular

07:06.450 --> 07:15.470
complex geometry and internal mass or mass distribution or method distribution, it is escala quantity.

07:15.810 --> 07:19.410
And no, I, I in capital letters.

07:20.670 --> 07:24.090
Which can be calculated with mathematical procedures.

07:25.300 --> 07:33.610
Here are given some examples and the formulas of the moment of inertia for these bodies just to deliver

07:33.760 --> 07:39.940
an intuitive view, of course, you don't need to know the details of the calculations, but loosely

07:39.940 --> 07:44.350
speaking, if a body rotates around its center of mass.

07:45.660 --> 07:48.210
The mall or around some, some.

07:50.250 --> 07:59.620
Other center at the moment of inertia of a body is usually somehow proportional to the mass of the body.

08:00.210 --> 08:04.890
Times the square of the radius of the body itself.

08:05.550 --> 08:10.680
It depends, obviously, how how complicated the body is.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.500
Sometimes you cannot just define the radius.

08:13.500 --> 08:17.370
But in these cases, at least in some cases, you can you can do so.

08:18.550 --> 08:22.400
In general, the spinning angular momentum L.

08:22.860 --> 08:32.950
S is given by this formula as equals I the moment of inertia times Omega, where Omega is a mathematical

08:32.950 --> 08:42.460
expression of the angular velocity, which is a measure, so to speak, of how fast it spins around

08:42.790 --> 08:43.890
around itself.

08:44.320 --> 08:54.250
That is how quickly it completes 360 degrees rotation per unit time, which in the case of a spherical

08:54.250 --> 08:58.540
body is just Omega equals V.

08:58.540 --> 09:04.930
Over are the rotational speed of the body divided by its diameter.

09:07.110 --> 09:13.770
Therefore, we must distinguish between between the angular momentum of a particle or a body moving

09:13.770 --> 09:20.970
around the center, for example, a planet around the sun and the angular momentum of a body around

09:20.970 --> 09:30.630
its own central axis as the examples above the above mentioned case of angular momentum of the earth

09:30.840 --> 09:33.850
spinning, spinning around its polar axis.

09:35.160 --> 09:40.810
These are two closely related, related, but slightly different quantities.

09:41.790 --> 09:49.350
One is an orbital angular momentum, while the other is a spinning, angular momentum, also known simply

09:49.350 --> 09:50.340
as spin.

09:52.340 --> 10:04.310
Therefore, the total angular momentum is the sum of the two, the total is equal and orbital plus a

10:04.490 --> 10:04.970
spin.

10:08.010 --> 10:17.430
When we speak about angular momentum, it is important to remember and very important universal law,

10:18.420 --> 10:25.110
which is to keep in mind is what what we have to keep in mind is that of the conservation of angular

10:25.110 --> 10:30.450
momentum, which is a direct consequence of the of the conservation of energy.

10:30.960 --> 10:36.300
That is, as you probably know and have learned in schools in your school.

10:36.960 --> 10:45.090
And energy can never be created or destroyed, but energy can only be transformed from mechanical energy

10:45.090 --> 10:49.590
into heat or into electricity and vice versa and so on.

10:51.540 --> 11:01.140
The law of conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum cannot change if

11:01.140 --> 11:07.560
there is not an interaction from outside and if there is no friction or it.

11:08.070 --> 11:15.090
For some reason, the system does not lose this energy and its angular momentum.

11:15.570 --> 11:24.540
So in a closed system, angular momentum cannot change and must be conserved that it is conserved unless

11:24.550 --> 11:30.240
an external torquil acts on the rotating body.

11:32.630 --> 11:40.460
In this equation, the radios are on the speed we are allowed to change and the equation that we saw

11:40.460 --> 11:45.590
previously, but the overall momentum l must remain constant.

11:46.940 --> 11:55.790
If a particle gets closer to the center, which means are decreases, the angular velocity therefore

11:55.790 --> 12:02.580
must increase to maintain a constant otherwise would not remain constant.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.690
It's just a matter of math.

12:06.470 --> 12:08.960
This also holds for an extended body.

12:10.640 --> 12:18.560
And the very common the typical common example illustrating the principle of the conservation of angular

12:18.560 --> 12:22.220
momentum is that of the ice skater.

12:23.270 --> 12:33.110
When ice skaters bring their arms closer, closer to the to their bodies, the angular velocity must

12:33.110 --> 12:35.190
increase and vice versa.

12:36.110 --> 12:42.860
If they bring their arms far from their body, their rotational speed decreases.

12:44.120 --> 12:55.880
In fact, this act, that of moving the arms, decreases the inertia eye of the body of the skater ice

12:55.880 --> 13:02.780
skater according to the law of conservation, of angular momentum and increase of omega must follow

13:03.170 --> 13:08.950
to maintain unless there's been angular momentum, constant and vice versa.

13:11.010 --> 13:19.410
Now that we have been introduced to the main concept and principle of the the angular momentum in classical

13:19.590 --> 13:31.020
mechanics, let us see its meaning if there is any meaning, but at least how we can apply this concept

13:31.230 --> 13:34.740
of angular momentum also in quantum physics.
