WEBVTT

00:01.050 --> 00:04.350
As well known cuts don't speak.

00:05.740 --> 00:06.310
That child.

00:06.310 --> 00:16.660
Question then is what if we replaced Schrödinger's cat with a human and asked him what it feels like

00:16.660 --> 00:19.000
to be in a superposition state?

00:20.620 --> 00:23.950
Moved by this a bit weird question.

00:24.520 --> 00:33.820
A Gene Wagner, Hungarian-american physicist, proposed in 1961 an extended form of the Schrödinger's

00:33.820 --> 00:39.760
Cat Paradox, and which is nowadays called the Weakness Friend Paradox.

00:41.430 --> 00:50.730
In a thought experiment, Wagner imagined how a physicist say Wagner himself does not directly observe

00:50.730 --> 00:53.160
the quantum system in superposition.

00:53.700 --> 01:03.450
Say a cat that is dead or alive, or as we are going to do here, a system of particles that are in

01:03.450 --> 01:06.240
a superposition state with measurement.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.460
Results one or zero.

01:09.090 --> 01:20.310
But rather let another physicist, his friend, perform the quantum measurement on the system in a laboratory

01:20.430 --> 01:23.430
isolated from the environment.

01:24.950 --> 01:28.610
Later, his friend will communicate the results to him.

01:29.690 --> 01:34.610
Perfect Isolation from the environment is essential in this idealized experiment.

01:34.610 --> 01:41.870
As otherwise, the system would quickly cohere and collapse into an eigen state.

01:43.350 --> 01:51.360
And in this ideal situation, one could apply the laws of quantum mechanics and consider the time evolution

01:51.360 --> 01:55.560
of the laboratory laboratory quantum states unilaterally.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.660
As unitary transformations.

01:59.590 --> 02:05.620
So here we can see in this picture on the outside is Wagner.

02:05.860 --> 02:13.510
And who lets his friend inside this box perform the measurement on the quantum system.

02:13.510 --> 02:23.560
And he lets first his friend make this measurement, and only then he makes the measurement on his friend.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.310
That is asks his friend about the result.

02:28.790 --> 02:34.760
So this is the situation like shown in the figure before.

02:34.790 --> 02:38.840
Both weakness friend and weakness himself.

02:38.990 --> 02:44.780
Make any measurement in this situation weakness.

02:44.780 --> 02:52.690
Friend considers the state of the system as in superposition to be as follows.

02:52.700 --> 03:04.730
That is alpha get zero plus better get one for system s and where obviously the get zero and get one

03:05.210 --> 03:15.440
being the spin zero and spin one respectively or whatever binary state of the system as and as usual

03:15.470 --> 03:20.570
alpha and beta being the probability coefficients for each state.

03:23.150 --> 03:33.740
Meanwhile, for Wagner, who stands out of the system plus friend laboratory context, that is an out

03:33.740 --> 03:42.820
of the box, literally pun intended before he measures anything that joins State.

03:42.830 --> 03:44.990
Must be the following.

03:46.130 --> 03:53.170
Meaning that it must be a superposition of all the possible states between the system and the friend

03:53.180 --> 03:55.520
that is the system in.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.180
Zero state.

03:57.180 --> 04:03.720
Then the friend sees zero and gets himself in a corresponding zero state.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.300
F.

04:04.830 --> 04:05.480
R.

04:05.640 --> 04:09.380
The system is in state one.

04:09.390 --> 04:15.630
Therefore also the friend must see and finally measure one.

04:15.630 --> 04:24.690
But before this measurement for weakness, there is a superposition of the these two possibilities.

04:26.450 --> 04:33.590
Note that this this equation assumes the linearity of Schrodinger's equation.

04:34.540 --> 04:41.140
That is when two solutions, that is two states are allowed, then also the sum of their two states

04:41.140 --> 04:42.070
is allowed.

04:42.220 --> 04:45.700
This will become important for some later consideration.

04:46.810 --> 04:53.170
So now let weakness friend perform a measurement on the system.

04:54.820 --> 05:02.860
According to the rules of quantum mechanics, this means that he has to select out this collapse project

05:02.860 --> 05:06.580
or reduce or whatever you would like to call it.

05:06.850 --> 05:14.760
The state function and this must be projected into one of its possible bases.

05:15.070 --> 05:26.050
Say, for example, that the eigen basis gets zero s meaning in the zero state, which for him then

05:26.050 --> 05:28.390
becomes a physical fact.

05:29.060 --> 05:37.880
Meaning that his state, that the state of the friend becomes zero as well.

05:38.300 --> 05:46.370
So we have cut zero se and cut zero F combined because they must be the same otherwise.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.350
That's because that's what weakness friend is has measured.

05:53.540 --> 06:03.320
However, for Wegner, who stands outside the laboratory and still hasn't made any observation of the

06:03.320 --> 06:11.840
joint structure system plus friend that is on the box, there has been still no collapse then no reduction,

06:11.840 --> 06:16.280
no projection or whatever of the wave function of the state vector.

06:16.820 --> 06:20.870
He must consider the system still in a superposition state.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.650
And therefore from weakness.

06:24.650 --> 06:32.600
Standing outside, he says the joint state must still be that of this equation here.

06:33.730 --> 06:40.900
That is still in a superposition state between the zeros and ones of the friend and the system.

06:44.030 --> 06:53.780
Finally, also, Wagner makes a measurement and projects the state function into one of its bases.

06:53.870 --> 07:02.030
Say, for example, cut one cat one F that is, he says, I measure.

07:02.900 --> 07:11.810
The friend in state one and the friend in and this system in state one and considers this also a physical

07:11.810 --> 07:18.020
fact that the system is in state one and his friend is also in a state one.

07:20.030 --> 07:21.260
Why is this so?

07:21.860 --> 07:31.700
Because according to Wiener, from the outside and according to the laws of quantum mechanics, as long

07:31.700 --> 07:39.440
as there is no measurement, the system must still be considered as being in a quantum superposition

07:40.700 --> 07:48.590
of the friend, seeing the system in zero or the friend seeing the system in State one.

07:49.620 --> 07:52.950
And as long as Wiener does not make this measurement.

07:53.220 --> 07:58.260
Both alternatives have equal probability to realize.

07:58.710 --> 08:01.110
That's what quantum mechanics tells us.

08:01.410 --> 08:09.030
Both possibilities still are possible for the outside observer and the state reduction can occur.

08:09.330 --> 08:16.530
That weakness Mather measures his friend in State one and the system equally in State one.

08:17.850 --> 08:24.150
This weird conclusion seems to suggest that in quantum physics, two observers can observe the same

08:24.150 --> 08:26.070
physical event differently.

08:27.090 --> 08:32.460
They can disagree on what for both is a physical fact.

08:34.200 --> 08:39.030
This amounts to saying that weakness Friend claims the cat is dead.

08:39.920 --> 08:46.730
While Wiener observes, observes the cat to be alive or vice versa.

08:46.910 --> 08:49.860
Weakness Friend claims the cat to be alive.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.750
While Wagner says No, I see the dead cat.

08:54.770 --> 08:59.690
Or in other words, objective reality does not exist.

08:59.780 --> 09:07.070
And reality seems to be, in a certain sense, subjective, because there could be different accounts

09:07.070 --> 09:16.010
of the very same process and there is no observer independent fact that seems to exist.

09:18.320 --> 09:23.930
This bizarre conclusion led to the wildest conjectures and speculations.

09:24.680 --> 09:33.770
Many see this paradox as proof of the role of the observer and quantum mechanics according to the interpretation

09:33.770 --> 09:40.490
that is so in fashion nowadays, and that if you follow this course, probably you know that I don't

09:40.490 --> 09:41.520
favor at all.

09:41.540 --> 09:49.570
But that's what many people believe and say and favor according to interpretation.

09:49.820 --> 09:58.400
The key to avoid this mutually conflicting results between observers is in the mind or the consciousness

09:58.400 --> 09:59.480
of the observer.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.820
Observer observers themselves.

10:01.820 --> 10:03.950
That is the weakness, strength and weakness.

10:05.140 --> 10:13.420
Because when weakness friend observes the system, we can say that the wave function collapses immediately

10:13.420 --> 10:15.020
to to a definite state.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.540
Say zero.

10:18.510 --> 10:22.590
Before Vigna makes any observation on the joint system.

10:24.010 --> 10:30.100
Therefore it is weakness, friend, mind or consciousness that causes this collapse.

10:31.310 --> 10:35.510
And therefore, because this collapse has already occurred.

10:36.490 --> 10:42.070
Wagner will, of course, obviously observe his friend being in a state zero as well.

10:43.140 --> 10:52.110
And then if both see the system in a state zero and Wagner sees his friend in a state zero, then there

10:52.110 --> 10:53.310
is no paradox.

10:53.310 --> 11:00.180
There would be no contradictory observation between the two, and the paradox disappears.

11:02.350 --> 11:08.500
Wagner, in fact, pointed out that the physical act of measurement isn't sufficient to cause a collapse,

11:08.500 --> 11:09.070
according to.

11:09.910 --> 11:14.200
Rather, it must be the conscious awareness of an observer.

11:14.920 --> 11:20.200
This is necessary to cause a collapse, according to with Wagner.

11:20.650 --> 11:29.860
As long as no conscious observer is involved, see save, there are only microscopic quantum particles

11:29.860 --> 11:32.590
instead of cats, friends and other physicists.

11:33.220 --> 11:33.910
Yes.

11:33.910 --> 11:41.170
Then we can say they are effectively in a permanent superposition state all along the temporal sequence

11:41.170 --> 11:42.640
of the processes.

11:43.570 --> 11:52.570
Thus, Wagner moved the dividing line between the quantum system, the quantum object to be observed,

11:52.570 --> 11:57.910
the quantum world in general, and the classical measurement apparatus.

11:57.940 --> 11:59.110
The macroscopic.

11:59.810 --> 12:05.720
Device with which we make a measurement into the conscious mind of the observer.

12:06.970 --> 12:10.020
To put it into the words of weakness.

12:10.330 --> 12:18.340
The being with a consciousness must have a different role in quantum mechanics than the inanimate measuring

12:18.340 --> 12:19.090
device.

12:20.950 --> 12:28.720
It is from this kind of speculation that the infamous role of the observer in quantum physics gained

12:28.720 --> 12:31.150
an overwhelming celebrity.

12:31.570 --> 12:38.220
But there is less weird interpretation, one that is much more in line with current knowledge.

12:38.230 --> 12:44.410
If we ask ourselves what physical process constitutes a measurement?

12:44.980 --> 12:47.920
What does it mean to make a measurement?

12:50.260 --> 12:56.860
As you know, and as we have discussed in the previous lectures in quantum physics, a measurement is

12:56.860 --> 13:04.060
always a quantitative assessment of the eigenvalue associated with the dynamical variables.

13:04.060 --> 13:04.840
Operator.

13:05.350 --> 13:11.590
For example, measuring the spin of an electron implies the projection of the state vector onto one

13:11.590 --> 13:21.760
of its ion bases, and that is spin up or spin down and a real scalar quantity, the eigenvalue being

13:21.760 --> 13:23.980
its intrinsic angular momentum.

13:23.980 --> 13:26.560
And that is the result of measurement.

13:28.110 --> 13:35.670
Whereas if there is no measurement, there is no collapse of the wave function or also the other way

13:35.670 --> 13:36.120
around.

13:36.120 --> 13:42.600
If there is no collapse of the wave function, there could be no measurement, not even in principle.

13:44.130 --> 13:53.340
So if weakness friend makes a measurement, a projection of the state vector also, of course, which

13:53.370 --> 14:00.780
settles the result for weakness as well, and therefore no inconsistency arises.

14:01.830 --> 14:07.800
Meanwhile, if there is no collapse, then weakness Friend did not make any measurement in the first

14:07.800 --> 14:08.430
place.

14:09.130 --> 14:15.790
There is nothing we can call an observer independent fact to begin with.

14:16.760 --> 14:21.290
And we could not even begin to ask his friend what was measured.

14:21.770 --> 14:23.750
Either way, there is no paradox.

14:23.750 --> 14:30.560
If we assume that measurement always causes or rather is the collapse of the wavefunction.

14:32.620 --> 14:39.520
In other words, the weakness friend paradox arises only if we assume that the that the state collapse

14:39.520 --> 14:42.770
takes place at the time of weakness.

14:42.790 --> 14:43.660
Question.

14:44.860 --> 14:51.550
But according to the rules of quantum mechanics, as long as no measurement takes place, the system

14:51.550 --> 14:57.100
must still be considered as being in a quantum superposition of the alternative outcomes.

14:58.420 --> 15:06.820
But in the weakness friend paradox, one assumes that in the temporal sequence for weakness friend,

15:06.820 --> 15:14.590
the quantum collapse of the wave function occurs much earlier than what weakness observed.

15:15.580 --> 15:22.660
There must therefore be a discrepancy between the temporal sequence of the state reduction, according

15:22.660 --> 15:24.280
to the two observers.

15:25.510 --> 15:34.060
And since no known physical law or rule lift's weakness or weakness friend to the status of a privileged

15:34.060 --> 15:34.930
observer.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.570
A paradox arises.

15:38.800 --> 15:48.310
However, no paradox arises if we accept the fact that whatever measurement leads to a state reduction.

15:49.450 --> 15:56.110
It occurs whenever weakness friend makes a measurement, not when weakness makes a measurement.

15:58.800 --> 16:06.600
Some object saying that the state reduction is only an update of our knowledge about the system and

16:06.600 --> 16:10.380
does not indicate a physical change in the system itself.

16:11.400 --> 16:17.910
When weakness friend makes a measurement, he does not change the system superposition state and indeed

16:17.910 --> 16:20.880
he also must be in a position state.

16:22.470 --> 16:22.950
Now.

16:22.950 --> 16:30.630
This reasoning, however, implies that a measurement is not a physical process, but only a pure information

16:30.630 --> 16:33.630
retrieval that updates our knowledge.

16:35.300 --> 16:42.860
Yet measurements that assess a value always imply some sort of physical process, such as a particle

16:42.860 --> 16:51.170
that hits a detector screen or that is absorbed by a CD camera, or that makes a photomultiplier click

16:51.170 --> 16:54.170
or that makes a pointer swing, etc., etc..

16:55.040 --> 17:01.190
Therefore, at the bottom, the paradox arises only if we assume that measurement that the measurement

17:01.190 --> 17:03.080
isn't a physical process.

17:03.740 --> 17:07.310
But it always is in some form or another.

17:09.670 --> 17:16.690
More recently, extended experiments have been proposed as an extension of the weakness and thought

17:16.690 --> 17:24.880
experiment to a scenario with two weakness and two friends, each measuring an entangled, entangled

17:24.880 --> 17:25.630
particle.

17:26.960 --> 17:33.230
The experiment and the formal theory describing it are quite complicated, and we won't describe them

17:33.230 --> 17:34.100
further here.

17:34.310 --> 17:41.690
It might only be said that essentially the same happens as in the conventional weakness thought experiment,

17:41.690 --> 17:46.670
but with two entangled particles rather than a single particle in superposition.

17:48.770 --> 17:55.400
What came out from this is the scientists concluded that quantum theory cannot consistently describe

17:55.400 --> 18:03.440
the use of itself and that single world interpretations of quantum theory cannot be self-consistent.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.410
And these claims made big headlines throughout the press claiming that it was experimentally shown that

18:12.410 --> 18:14.720
objective reality does not exist.

18:16.480 --> 18:25.510
This was about 2018, and a year later, a group of Scottish physicists realised an experiment intended

18:25.510 --> 18:29.110
to test this extended weakness thought experiment.

18:29.470 --> 18:36.100
Their experiments seemingly confirmed that there are no locally observable, independent facts.

18:38.050 --> 18:45.010
But who or what did they use as the weakness, the two weakness and the two weakness?

18:45.010 --> 18:45.790
Friends.

18:46.890 --> 18:54.090
They used photodetectors for the weakness and photons for the two weakness friends.

18:55.730 --> 18:58.610
This, however, makes the whole experiment doubtful.

18:58.970 --> 19:07.430
While a photodetector is a measurement device that undoubtably makes a measurement that is projects

19:07.430 --> 19:16.310
the state vector onto one of its ion bases, a couple of photons can't be considered physical objects,

19:16.310 --> 19:18.230
causing a state reduction.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.690
The claim that a photon is an observer.

19:22.960 --> 19:29.950
Making a measurement is a questionable statement, to say the least, let alone that it is a conscious

19:29.950 --> 19:30.730
observer.

19:31.770 --> 19:37.620
Thus it is questionable if these experiments prove anything at all.

19:40.520 --> 19:47.120
Notice also that another, more or less unaware assumption leads to weakness paradox.

19:47.900 --> 19:53.300
We assume that quantum mechanics must necessarily be unitary and linear.

19:54.410 --> 20:00.800
Again, recall the definition of linearity and unitary ity we discussed in the previous lectures.

20:00.800 --> 20:01.100
Four.

20:01.300 --> 20:04.730
For simplicity, I sum it up here again.

20:05.640 --> 20:14.700
Before a measurement, Schrodinger's equation linearity and the unity of the time evolution that describes

20:14.700 --> 20:17.910
the quantum states continues to hold.

20:18.960 --> 20:27.150
Whereas, after the measurement line, linearity and unit parity are, so to speak, broken up in the

20:27.150 --> 20:33.930
sense that we observe one and only one result, that is, there are no superpositions left.

20:34.410 --> 20:40.300
And once the system is in an ideal state, only one probability is assigned.

20:40.320 --> 20:49.200
That is one meaning certainty to observe over and over again the same result for each subsequent measurement.

20:49.530 --> 20:52.650
Once the first projective measurement has been done.

20:54.190 --> 21:03.640
The probability and even before the measurement had to be observed, say 50% of probability to be observed

21:04.090 --> 21:08.160
now will be observed with 100% probability.

21:08.170 --> 21:09.910
That is probability.

21:09.910 --> 21:11.860
Conservation has been broken.

21:13.050 --> 21:19.560
This is essentially what we mean by a state projection according to the projection or measurement postulates

21:19.560 --> 21:22.590
and what measurement is in itself.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.420
In weakness thought experiment.

21:26.420 --> 21:31.250
However, quantum superposition and entanglement are supposed to continue.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.940
Also after the measurement by weakness, friend.

21:35.750 --> 21:40.940
Which means unity, unity and linearity are assumed to continue to hold.

21:42.420 --> 21:48.480
There has been no projection or reduction or collapse, whatever you would like to call it, as a result

21:48.480 --> 21:50.160
of a measurement interaction.

21:51.400 --> 21:56.680
One attributes outcomes to entangled systems or in quantum superposition.

21:56.680 --> 22:04.060
Contrary to the well-known fact from our everyday macroscopic microscopic experience that once a measurement

22:04.060 --> 22:09.430
has been performed, it never reveals a system to be in two states at once.

22:10.770 --> 22:19.920
Any correlation obtained from a unitary and linearly deduced fact at weakness level has no equivalent

22:19.920 --> 22:28.020
relationship to an outcome that accord or effect that has been obtained at his friend's level.

22:29.450 --> 22:39.470
If superposition and entanglement are to be observed, then nobody would see any result to see anything.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.480
Unity must be broken.

22:42.490 --> 22:49.390
And because we see in our everyday experience measurement results, This is yet another reason to believe

22:49.390 --> 22:57.550
that the present quantum mechanical formalism, which is exquisitely unitary, should be considered

22:57.550 --> 23:02.740
incomplete and may have to be expanded to a non unitary.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.830
Quantum theory in the future.

23:08.980 --> 23:13.110
So you see this thing with weakness.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.940
Rent is still a controversial issue.

23:16.900 --> 23:22.500
Physicists could not converge on a general consensus of how it should be interpreted.

23:22.510 --> 23:30.040
If it really tells us something about reality that is supposedly dependent from observers, if it has

23:30.040 --> 23:32.440
to do with our mind and consciousness.

23:32.470 --> 23:40.780
If it signals an inconsistency or in the theory of quantum theory or not, etc., the discussion on

23:40.780 --> 23:48.400
this is going on and you will find several physicists having very different assessments on this.

23:49.540 --> 23:58.180
In my opinion, however, the weakness friend paradox is only an extension of Schrödinger's cat paradox

23:58.390 --> 24:03.400
and only a generalization, if you wish, of the measurement problem.

24:04.540 --> 24:12.850
It furnishes yet another perspective on the measurement measurement problem, but without telling us

24:12.850 --> 24:14.170
really much more.

24:15.610 --> 24:25.540
It raises again the question of when and where exactly the collapse, of course, and whether this collapse

24:25.720 --> 24:26.380
or.

24:27.610 --> 24:36.010
Projection or whatever you might call it, is actually a real physical process or only an abstract mathematical

24:36.010 --> 24:37.390
description of reality.

24:39.080 --> 24:48.980
As long as no real measurements are made without thermal decoherence, processes say we consider only

24:48.980 --> 24:56.000
microscopic quantum particles instead of macroscopic bodies such as cats, friends and physicists.

24:57.110 --> 25:04.970
These microscopic quantum objects are effectively in a permanent superposition state all along the temporal

25:04.970 --> 25:12.800
sequence of the process that is all along the so-called von Neumann chain.

25:14.710 --> 25:21.970
The question is, where is the demarcation line between what we describe as the wave function and a

25:21.970 --> 25:23.290
collapsed wave function?

25:24.360 --> 25:33.180
The point is that nobody knows where to place the demarcation line and if it exists at all.

25:34.350 --> 25:38.220
This is what is sometimes called the Heisenberg's Cut.

25:40.100 --> 25:47.690
Thus the weakness friend paradox restates in a certain sense the measurement problem in a somewhat different

25:47.690 --> 25:52.370
manner, but does not really add any new insights.

25:54.260 --> 25:58.070
At any rate, whatever the truth, this debate is interesting.

25:58.160 --> 25:59.490
Interesting in itself.

25:59.510 --> 26:07.970
The history of science shows that whenever internal inconsistencies arise in the theory, this is usually

26:07.970 --> 26:13.580
an indication that it is incomplete and must be replaced by a better theory.

26:14.810 --> 26:23.990
These sorts of conceptual anomalies that suggested the incompletion of a theoretical framework have

26:23.990 --> 26:27.770
often led to great breakthroughs in science.

26:28.700 --> 26:34.550
The future will tell if this is the case here as well.
