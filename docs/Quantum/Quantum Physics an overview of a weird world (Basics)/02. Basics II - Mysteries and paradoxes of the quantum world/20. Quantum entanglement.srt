00:00.560 --> 00:08.270
Let us connect the concept of quantum indistinguishably to another important concept, that of quantum

00:08.270 --> 00:09.160
entanglement.

00:10.400 --> 00:17.120
If you got the message about why and how quantum in this indistinguishably is very different from our

00:17.120 --> 00:24.830
ordinary conception of indistinguishably, it should no longer be difficult to grasp the quantum entanglement

00:24.830 --> 00:25.430
concept.

00:26.780 --> 00:35.090
We will now see how this sort of quantum wholeness, so to speak, not only is a phenomenon that stands

00:35.090 --> 00:41.810
behind indistinguishable particles, but in quantum mechanics, is a more and much more general and

00:41.810 --> 00:47.660
fundamental fact also between very different particles, like the entanglement between an electron and

00:47.660 --> 00:55.370
a positron or a proton and a neutron, or as is usually done experimentally nowadays, simply between

00:55.520 --> 01:00.350
two photons, but with different polarizations for for example.

01:01.930 --> 01:10.420
So what is quantum entanglement, the term was coined by Schrodinger from the German word for shrunken

01:10.810 --> 01:18.130
and physically quantum entanglement can be realized when particles such as electrons of protons, photons

01:18.130 --> 01:25.870
or even larger molecules interact with each other, quantum mechanically at a macroscopic scale and

01:25.870 --> 01:29.620
then separate after separation.

01:29.950 --> 01:37.990
As long as they do not interact with another particle, atom or molecule or whatever in the in the environment,

01:38.410 --> 01:46.510
they remain entangled, just as we saw in the case of the quantum scattering and the spherical probability

01:46.510 --> 01:46.990
wave.

01:48.550 --> 01:56.950
As long as one of the electrons does not interact with the detector, the compound system is not described,

01:56.950 --> 02:06.430
by the way, function of two particles or even not by two wave packets, but by a unique, undifferentiated

02:06.610 --> 02:15.580
hole expanding into space or simply state, which one must describe as undefined.

02:16.820 --> 02:25.250
A first possible example of producing entangled photons is that obtained by using radioactive materials,

02:25.940 --> 02:29.870
consider a radioactive source of decaying atoms.

02:30.380 --> 02:33.080
We know that this is a typical quantum process.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.830
Recall what we have learned on quantum tunneling.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.550
A typical radioactive decay is the better, the better.

02:40.550 --> 02:48.980
Plus, decay whereby a proton in an atomic nucleus decays into a neutron atom.

02:48.980 --> 02:56.000
It's a positron that is the anti electron with positive charge and opposite spin.

02:56.540 --> 03:00.710
And this happens together with the emission of other particles.

03:00.980 --> 03:06.110
That is an electron neutrino and eventually gamma rays.

03:06.110 --> 03:13.670
And these gamma rays are up for our interests of our interest because these are then entangled protons.

03:14.990 --> 03:22.520
The neutron remains inside the atomic nucleus and converts the atom into another element, one with

03:22.520 --> 03:25.550
a proton, less with atomic number decreased by one.

03:26.960 --> 03:34.040
The positron instead is ejected out of the atomic nuclear nucleus.

03:34.040 --> 03:42.980
And unless the environment is not a perfect vacuum, it will soon find on its way another electron and

03:42.980 --> 03:52.160
annihilate by emitting two photons in the opposite directions and with opposite circular polarizations

03:52.880 --> 03:56.360
that is recall with opposite Telecity.

03:56.900 --> 04:01.370
That is opposite spins as shown in this figure here.

04:03.270 --> 04:11.160
This is just an example with photons as photons are usually the most manageable objects in the laboratory.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.290
That's why we make this example.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.060
Many other possible sources of entangled particles are possible.

04:18.630 --> 04:27.210
So let us keep general and think of particles, photons or material particles generally, and which

04:27.210 --> 04:34.620
are emitted by radioactive decay or by a source, just generally a source from which they had a common

04:34.950 --> 04:35.640
origin.

04:36.810 --> 04:43.770
They are emitted in exactly the opposite directions because the origin originating, decaying in single

04:43.770 --> 04:47.540
particles is addressed in the in the laboratory.

04:48.180 --> 04:57.690
And therefore, because of the universal law of conservation of moment and energy, they must fly in

04:57.690 --> 05:01.470
directions which can sell their momenta.

05:03.450 --> 05:10.440
For the same reason, the two particles must also have opposite spins as the original particle from

05:10.440 --> 05:16.830
which they originated had opposite intrinsic angular momentum, which sums up to zero momentum.

05:18.960 --> 05:22.840
Therefore, the two spins must cancel each other as well.

05:23.610 --> 05:30.990
That is, if one particle shows up with spin up, we can be sure that the other will show up with pin

05:30.990 --> 05:31.380
down.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.000
And the opposite is true as well.

05:35.330 --> 05:42.770
This means that we have only to look at one political spin to know that the other particle will have

05:42.800 --> 05:43.790
the opposite spin.

05:45.200 --> 05:52.760
Moreover, think of them moving apart to a great distance, say, giving them sufficient time to eventually

05:53.000 --> 06:05.660
separate separate light years away in space and through to another star system before you make a measurement

06:05.660 --> 06:07.780
on it on one of the two particles.

06:07.790 --> 06:16.280
I mean, during this time, we must also imagine them having along their path no further interaction

06:16.280 --> 06:19.040
with anything else in the environment.

06:20.090 --> 06:24.530
The particles must maintain their state of coherence.

06:25.850 --> 06:34.940
Now, as we are accustomed to doing in this series of lectures, let us first take the naive classical

06:34.940 --> 06:40.790
understanding and then shift shift to the correct quantum description of what is going on.

06:41.830 --> 06:50.200
Naively, before any measurement, we might imagine the system to be in one or the other state, that

06:50.200 --> 07:01.600
is that one of the following two possible cases as first case, let's call it case one, we have a particle

07:01.600 --> 07:04.480
will spin up travelling towards the left side.

07:05.170 --> 07:12.790
Let's level it direction A on the opposite side in direction B, we have the particle with spin down.

07:14.120 --> 07:22.070
Then in the exact same fashion as we did in the section on Quantum in this indistinguishably, we can

07:22.070 --> 07:25.730
represent the system using a product state vector.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.620
A couple times we get minus.

07:32.680 --> 07:38.920
The other possible case case, too, is that in which we have the particle on the left with spin down

07:39.490 --> 07:45.130
and the particle flying in direction, B will spin up, as in this figure here.

07:47.010 --> 07:54.060
Therefore, the state better must be written as a kid, minus times we get plus.

07:55.330 --> 08:02.800
We can have only these two cases, we can't get both particles to spin up or spin now, they must be

08:03.400 --> 08:07.780
a. correlated, as is customary to say.

08:09.170 --> 08:16.820
But we get to know this only after the measurement, before the measurement, we don't know which of

08:16.820 --> 08:19.040
the two possible outcomes will be measured.

08:21.070 --> 08:28.630
However, again, this is a naive classical understanding of things, why the point is that the two

08:28.630 --> 08:36.820
states, those of course, one or two are not what quantum mechanics considered the state of the system

08:37.180 --> 08:43.090
during flight time because the particles would in principle still be distinguishable.

08:44.420 --> 08:50.090
In quantum mechanics, indistinguishably is much more radical, as we know, than the classical one,

08:50.090 --> 08:54.230
and extends into all quantum phenomenon, not just scattering processes.

08:55.580 --> 08:59.450
Therefore, the same must fit in the present situation as well.

09:00.530 --> 09:06.320
We are not allowed to distinguish between which particle goes left or right.

09:07.130 --> 09:13.850
Therefore, we are not allowed to distinguish between which has been up or spin down, as we would like

09:13.850 --> 09:17.540
to imagine naively with case one or two.

09:19.100 --> 09:26.390
Therefore, this must be expressed again in the algebraic expression of quantum mechanics when we have

09:26.390 --> 09:33.620
still not measured the system during flight time, quantum mechanics forces us to take the superposition

09:33.620 --> 09:35.090
principle seriously.

09:36.290 --> 09:42.050
That is, it wants us to consider the position of both possible cases.

09:42.210 --> 09:43.550
Case one and case two.

09:44.720 --> 09:51.020
Which means which means the situation somehow depicted in this figure here where we see.

09:52.030 --> 10:02.560
The two particles spinning at the same time with two over superposition, angular momentum, intrinsic

10:02.560 --> 10:03.430
angular momentum.

10:05.070 --> 10:12.360
Therefore, the full quantum state side of the system must be described by a single state vector of

10:12.360 --> 10:21.480
particles with opposite spins and zero total angular momentum, also called a singlet state, which

10:21.480 --> 10:28.400
is a sum of the two possible igan states of the two particles and which is given here.

10:29.070 --> 10:36.660
And this expression should not be new to not do you know, you should be able to decipher it.

10:37.620 --> 10:44.820
And also the plus minus sign, again, representing the case of bosun's or fermions, respectively,

10:45.150 --> 10:47.790
as we shall see better later.

10:49.260 --> 10:55.260
So according to quantum mechanics, during flight, we have neither case one or no case two, but both

10:55.260 --> 11:00.240
at the same time and we again face the logical end case.

11:01.590 --> 11:10.050
However, when the measurement is performed, then the state vector is projected onto one of the two

11:10.050 --> 11:15.990
eigenvectors that is a cat plus B minus.

11:16.380 --> 11:22.710
That is a particle on the left appears with spin up and the particle on the right appears with spin

11:22.710 --> 11:26.310
down or the opposite case.

11:26.700 --> 11:34.230
A cat minus B plus the particle on the left appears to spin down and the particle on the right appears

11:34.230 --> 11:34.880
to spin up.

11:35.550 --> 11:40.590
Each case was 50 percent pure chance.

11:41.960 --> 11:49.970
And that's obviously the one over square root two, as you know, that in this figure levels A and B

11:50.450 --> 11:56.980
were omitted at the end on the third figure to highlight indistinguishably little.

11:58.660 --> 12:01.630
Once a measurement of the spin occurs.

12:02.760 --> 12:13.470
On one particle, one speaks of the state vector reduction, a state vector reduction takes place if

12:13.470 --> 12:18.960
we measure speed up state of the for the party on the left side, we already know that even without

12:18.960 --> 12:25.910
measuring it, the other particle must possess a spin down state and vice versa.

12:25.920 --> 12:35.700
Of course, that is the act of measurement collapses, the entangled system of particles either in state

12:35.700 --> 12:37.740
of case one or case two.

12:38.680 --> 12:43.090
But before that, both exist and I realized.

12:44.300 --> 12:50.930
The point is, according to quantum mechanics, the state reduction of WAF can function Kaleck collapse,

12:50.930 --> 12:53.640
if you prefer, happens instantly.

12:54.800 --> 12:58.630
The state vector projection is an instantaneous process.

12:59.270 --> 13:05.180
This, at least, is something that has been questioned more recently.

13:05.540 --> 13:05.930
But.

13:07.500 --> 13:15.300
Take it as such for it for the moment, the click of a detector which determines the state of one particle

13:15.450 --> 13:20.130
automatically and instantly, also determines the opposite state of the other particle.

13:21.540 --> 13:29.700
Again, it is not that we discover the state of a particle, which we did not know because of our ignorance

13:30.480 --> 13:38.100
or the lack of precise measurement, the two particles are in superposition state as long as no measurement

13:38.550 --> 13:47.010
takes place, only once the detector clicks with the measurement, so to speak, define the state of

13:47.010 --> 13:47.880
one particle.

13:49.080 --> 13:53.340
And therefore, all of the other also only then.

13:54.650 --> 13:58.490
Will the other particles opposite state become defined to.

13:59.820 --> 14:07.230
A common fallacy is that to believe that the fact that the outcome is unpredictable and that we always

14:07.230 --> 14:08.820
have 50 percent.

14:10.500 --> 14:17.160
Pure chance of measuring one or the other state implies that we are allowed to believe somehow that

14:17.160 --> 14:24.510
the particles intrinsically possess one or the other state when the source has emitted them at a time

14:24.510 --> 14:25.230
of emission.

14:25.770 --> 14:35.130
According to this view, based on a counterfactual definiteness reasoning, some very complicated process

14:35.130 --> 14:43.170
is going on at the source emission of the particle whereby we must describe their states with statistical

14:43.170 --> 14:44.100
probabilities.

14:44.910 --> 14:55.110
But they nevertheless supposedly possess a definite and correlated state that we will know only by measuring

14:55.110 --> 14:55.350
it.

14:56.460 --> 15:03.360
I hope, however, that you now understand and know and got it why this can't be the case.

15:03.820 --> 15:10.500
This would contradict quantum indistinguishably lity, which we know correctly predicts scattering processes

15:10.500 --> 15:12.070
as measured in the laboratory.

15:12.390 --> 15:18.810
Once we accept that went to equal quantum objects, interact with each other, they can no longer be

15:18.810 --> 15:23.430
considered separate systems made of two or more particles.

15:23.940 --> 15:31.440
They, so to speak, melt into one single quantum entity, a sort of unique, undifferentiated whole.

15:32.370 --> 15:41.910
Moreover, if that would be true, this idea of particles which are already a. correlated intrinsically

15:42.300 --> 15:49.290
at the instant of creation in their source, this idea would imply that quantum mechanics must be a

15:49.290 --> 15:51.080
theory with hidden variables.

15:52.260 --> 15:58.680
We will see, however, that the idea of quantum theory, of quantum theory containing hidden variables

15:58.680 --> 16:07.110
is possible only in the context of a theory which must accept nonlocal, instantaneous interactions.

16:08.010 --> 16:16.620
We must conclude that in the case of the entangled particles, their respective state is decided only

16:16.650 --> 16:20.340
at the time of measurement, not before that instant.

16:21.600 --> 16:29.040
This justifies also the name cingulate as we are dealing with something which is supposed to comprise

16:29.040 --> 16:33.210
two particles and yet behaves as a single entity.

16:34.440 --> 16:42.870
Entanglement given by this equation can be thought of as the realization of a physical state that sums

16:42.870 --> 16:50.790
up the principle of superposition, the principle of indistinguishably and the uncertainty principle.

16:52.390 --> 17:00.070
At this point, you may already have sensed the big problem with that if the instantaneous state reduction

17:00.070 --> 17:08.660
that defines the state of one particle must instantly determine that of the other particle as well at

17:08.660 --> 17:17.740
the time of measurement, even if they are light years apart, this seems to imply a sort of faster

17:17.740 --> 17:19.030
than light interaction.

17:21.710 --> 17:29.060
Keeping entangled particles far apart is experimentally a very difficult thing to do, as any particle

17:29.060 --> 17:35.570
will soon react with another particle in the environment causing therefore decoherence.

17:36.580 --> 17:42.470
Conceptually, however, it is a perfectly legitimate physical, physical possibility.

17:43.240 --> 17:50.680
Let us take, for instance, the case of a particle measured on Earth and another entangled one which

17:50.680 --> 18:01.180
has reached another stellar system, say, on the Alpha Centauri star system, which is about four point

18:01.180 --> 18:02.530
three light years away.

18:04.620 --> 18:10.980
This instantaneous state reduction or collapse of the wavefunction, if you prefer to call it that,

18:11.490 --> 18:19.110
implies that the the the measurement on Earth immediately determines the state of the particle on Alpha

18:19.110 --> 18:19.770
Centauri.

18:21.150 --> 18:28.230
The question then is how can a particle on Alpha Centauri immediately know the state of the measured

18:28.230 --> 18:29.430
particle on Earth?

18:29.850 --> 18:32.280
Taking its opposite spin state?

18:33.510 --> 18:39.270
A light signal from Earth to Alpha Centauri needs four point three years to transmit this information.

18:40.680 --> 18:46.710
Obviously, there is a huge problem with all of this because Einstein's theory of relativity strictly

18:46.710 --> 18:49.230
forbids faster than light interactions.

18:50.190 --> 18:56.970
That the speed of light is a physical limit which cannot be overcome is a fact that several experiments

18:56.970 --> 18:57.840
have confirmed.

18:59.010 --> 19:07.220
If that were not the case, the entire theory of relativity itself will be fast, too, because it forbids

19:07.230 --> 19:16.290
it, though it has been tested and shown to be corrected over and over again throughout over a century

19:16.290 --> 19:18.660
of experimental evidence.

19:19.800 --> 19:25.830
You can understand the kind of feeling this must have instilled in Einstein, the father of the theory

19:25.830 --> 19:26.730
of relativity.

19:27.330 --> 19:35.200
Einstein called that strange behavior of entangled particles as a spooky action at a distance.

19:36.060 --> 19:39.220
He obviously could not accept that at all.

19:40.350 --> 19:44.460
There seems to be a conflict here between quantum mechanics and relativity.

19:45.610 --> 19:52.300
Even after his debate with Moore, Einstein could not accept the state of affairs, at least not in

19:52.300 --> 19:52.930
this form.

19:53.950 --> 20:01.750
He was very puzzled by the idea that in the quantum reality, things could be entangled seemingly through

20:01.990 --> 20:06.460
faster than light correlation and was totally random outcomes.

20:06.460 --> 20:13.120
As the theory describes, he simply could not believe all that to be true somewhere.

20:13.120 --> 20:16.910
Somehow there is something that is escaping our understanding.

20:17.140 --> 20:20.410
This was at least his idea, his point of view.

20:20.800 --> 20:27.520
He continued pursuing the idea that all this must be only a provisional description of reality, which,

20:27.520 --> 20:31.330
however, cannot be complete and must lead to contradictions.

20:32.260 --> 20:37.560
Einstein was looking for something which shows us that we must return to a classical view.

20:38.440 --> 20:46.030
And indeed, at some point it seemed that Einstein, together with a few of his colleagues, found a

20:46.030 --> 20:53.470
powerful argument again in the form of a thought experiment, which seemed to be a final proof that

20:53.470 --> 21:02.650
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle somehow indirectly implies faster than light interaction among quantum

21:02.650 --> 21:04.030
entangled particles.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.850
And this could not be compatible with relativity.

21:09.070 --> 21:19.420
This is a famous paper which describes what nowadays is known as the EPR paradox and which will be the

21:19.420 --> 21:21.550
topic of the next lecture.
