00:00.560 --> 00:06.890
In introducing some important concepts which will establish the foundation for further discussion on

00:06.890 --> 00:16.820
which we will rely later, it is worthwhile to include a special section that extends the Garlock experiments

00:17.180 --> 00:20.120
to non perpendicular spin directions.

00:21.980 --> 00:31.670
Now, the natural question at this point is what happens if in the second measurement, instead of choosing

00:31.970 --> 00:43.130
the x axis perpendicular to that, we opted for some other axis in between the two, say, at 45 degrees

00:43.640 --> 00:44.660
instead of 90?

00:46.100 --> 00:54.620
Half probability and half as much as half each bar, half angular momentum, or if we measure the spin

00:54.620 --> 01:01.970
along a direction which is only slightly divergent from the Z axis, say only one degrees, will we

01:01.970 --> 01:08.240
have still 100 percent certain certainty to get that cat plus or a little bit less?

01:09.190 --> 01:17.680
And if so, how much less or more in general, what happens if for the second measurement, we measure

01:17.680 --> 01:25.270
the spin along a direction tilted by an annotator relative to the that axis?

01:26.590 --> 01:29.350
Let's label it the new axis.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.000
There is no way to learn this other than experimentally.

01:36.900 --> 01:45.070
And this can be done by smoothly rotating the second stangl magnet and one can measure.

01:45.390 --> 01:55.430
So by doing so, the spin component not only along the 90 degrees axis, but along any orientation in

01:55.440 --> 02:05.430
between by an arbitrary angle data as shown in the figure here, where for clarity, I display the same

02:05.430 --> 02:07.960
block diagram of the previous slide.

02:07.980 --> 02:08.460
Again.

02:10.300 --> 02:14.740
But this time by labelling the second axis as U.

02:15.280 --> 02:24.670
U instead of X, such an experimental setup allows us to measure how the probabilities vary to find

02:24.670 --> 02:26.650
a spin up or spin down particle.

02:27.710 --> 02:34.190
You will never get anything other than such a binary response, whatever angle you chose, you have

02:34.760 --> 02:35.570
to remember this.

02:36.290 --> 02:44.510
And by tilting the magnet by an angle theta between the Z axis and a new generic direction, the you

02:44.510 --> 02:45.110
axis.

02:47.050 --> 02:53.710
The source of particles in the first Asgeir magnets have only the function to produce, produce and

02:53.710 --> 02:58.090
prepare a stream of particles in Eisenstaedt state.

02:58.090 --> 03:02.620
That plus you could do the same thing also for that Cartman's.

03:02.620 --> 03:10.110
But just for convention, just let us take let's take this as an example of interest.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.800
Here is what the second is.

03:12.310 --> 03:16.570
You device will measure along a generic U.

03:16.570 --> 03:20.560
Tilted axis relative to the axis by tittered degrees.

03:21.070 --> 03:25.260
So what will happen by doing so?

03:25.300 --> 03:30.220
One obtains the probability distribution summarized in this graph.

03:32.070 --> 03:41.700
Along the axis of the graph, which is this line here, there isn't a line we can trace that tilting

03:41.700 --> 03:49.020
angle theta in degrees of the second as the magnets while on the ordinate axis, that is the vertical

03:49.020 --> 03:49.770
axis here.

03:50.880 --> 03:54.660
We can obtain the probability piece of data.

03:55.230 --> 04:01.150
That is the probability of getting a spin up or spin down measurement result in function of that angle.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.970
Let us briefly discuss this in more detail.

04:06.790 --> 04:14.470
Now, consider the EU oriented as the first one that is with Enel data equals zero.

04:15.100 --> 04:22.060
We are dealing then with the same situation we already examined, namely that of having two consecutive

04:22.540 --> 04:31.660
S.G. that devices with output that plus and we know that twice measuring the particle in angst etcetc

04:31.750 --> 04:34.660
plus along the same, that axis does not change anything.

04:34.930 --> 04:44.230
We will obtain with certainty P equals one the particle to be in that cat plus state where whereas with

04:44.230 --> 04:54.110
no chance at all you p equals zero of getting that cat minus state particle even through repeated measurements.

04:55.870 --> 04:58.470
Let us now change only by a little bit.

04:58.480 --> 05:05.430
The orientation of the EU relative to the Z axis, say by one degree.

05:06.370 --> 05:08.890
Then one would not expect much change.

05:09.430 --> 05:11.080
Taking repeated measurements.

05:11.380 --> 05:17.560
One will still get in almost all the cases, a particle in a spin upstate along the slightly tilted

05:17.560 --> 05:18.430
you axis.

05:19.030 --> 05:23.830
That is the you get plus state.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.590
However, on a very on very few occasions.

05:31.500 --> 05:40.410
You get minus will appear as well, after many measurements, it will turn out that on average, only

05:40.410 --> 05:47.880
about seven or eight particles out of 100000 will show up with a spin down state.

05:49.300 --> 05:55.510
This corresponds to an almost certainty, certainty of an almost certain probability for the spin up

05:55.870 --> 05:56.380
of.

05:57.800 --> 06:03.000
B equals zero nine nine nine nine two four probability.

06:03.110 --> 06:04.280
So almost certainty.

06:05.150 --> 06:08.150
I just tell that it is not displayed here.

06:10.190 --> 06:19.940
Tilting the EU further say setting data equal 45 degrees that is in between the two perpendicular axis

06:20.810 --> 06:23.660
will, however, definitely change things.

06:24.500 --> 06:33.860
About 85 percent will still be in spin up, but the remaining 50 percent will show up with a spin down.

06:35.250 --> 06:42.240
While four states are equal, 90 degrees, which is the measurement, again, of the spin state, Peralta's

06:42.240 --> 06:49.340
positively directed X-axis that we we saw previously the probability to find one or the other, then

06:49.440 --> 06:56.040
state, of course, 50 percent, as you should know well by now, and which, of course, is nothing

06:56.040 --> 07:07.260
other than what the equation with equal probabilities told us, that with the one over two square two

07:07.500 --> 07:17.670
factors that told us, as you might remember, once the SGU magnets are rotated by 180 degrees to each

07:17.670 --> 07:23.460
other, they are then a. parallel to the exact axis.

07:23.820 --> 07:29.280
And the second stangl at magnets looks for that cat minus particles.

07:30.290 --> 07:38.960
Obviously, though, nothing comes through, we have P equals zero because they were all prepared in

07:38.960 --> 07:41.300
that that Kate plus eight in St..

07:42.810 --> 07:53.700
Then continuing again for a degrees, we are in the same situation as that for the 90 x 90 degrees x

07:53.700 --> 08:00.510
axis, but with the magnets aligned in the opposite direction, direction, measuring for looking for

08:00.720 --> 08:04.050
the X minus particles.

08:05.880 --> 08:13.530
Finally, a full rotation of 360 degrees brings us back to the original parallel set axis measurement.

08:15.270 --> 08:23.970
So from these follow a couple of summarizing considerations which are necessary and necessary to keep

08:23.970 --> 08:31.770
in mind to try to avoid later confusion first, don't forget that with whatever angle one measures has

08:31.770 --> 08:36.810
been, it will always be has been up or spin down, each of which has an intrinsic angular momentum

08:36.810 --> 08:42.680
of plus or minus each paragraph, but never half or a fraction of it.

08:43.290 --> 08:51.660
The rotation of the S.G. device does not change the amount of angular momentum measured.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.400
It changes on the probability of finding the particles in one or the other.

08:58.410 --> 09:02.420
I can state it will never measure a different angular momentum.

09:03.060 --> 09:09.990
And this is the point which is very contrary to classical mechanics in quantum mechanics.

09:10.260 --> 09:16.230
From whatever angle you look at a spin, this remains a democratized.

09:17.200 --> 09:26.230
And quantized observable, secondly, recall that this is only a statistical and probabilistic prediction.

09:27.790 --> 09:29.200
A prediction that.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.180
May be also violated.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.540
We are talking only about probabilities.

09:34.570 --> 09:43.540
This is a curve, a continuous curve, not quantize curve, which, however, deals with quantized quantities.

09:44.380 --> 09:48.170
This means that only four P equation or P equals zero.

09:48.190 --> 09:56.380
Do you have absolute certainty of observing or not a certain spin value while in all the other cases

09:56.650 --> 10:00.040
there could well be statistical fluctuations?

10:01.030 --> 10:10.090
For instance, for theta equal 45 degrees, you may sometimes have a bit more or less than 50 percent

10:10.390 --> 10:15.390
spin down particles slipping through the S.G. device.

10:17.230 --> 10:19.720
Where do these random fluctuations come from?

10:20.750 --> 10:29.130
In quantum physics, randomness appears to be an intrinsic feature, something with no causes, as if

10:29.190 --> 10:34.910
randomness is without a hidden cause, that is without hidden variables.

10:35.870 --> 10:42.530
We will return to this important point later when we will discuss Bell's theorem theorem.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.620
So what does this graph finally show us?

10:47.770 --> 10:50.860
It looks wavy, doesn't it?

10:52.210 --> 10:56.090
Indeed, we are again dealing with a probability wave.

10:57.070 --> 11:00.340
It is like the wave function in the double slit experiment.

11:01.270 --> 11:08.620
On that occasion, a wave function seemed to spread throughout space from the slits and interfere on

11:08.620 --> 11:14.680
the detector screen, the squared models of which represented a probability distribution.

11:16.070 --> 11:22.370
We questioned whether it was a real object or simply a calculation tool.

11:24.030 --> 11:32.400
Here we again have probability, but we cannot associate it with anything we might imagine as an entity

11:32.400 --> 11:39.030
moving in space and time, it is simply the probabilistic description of a particle having a spin up

11:39.030 --> 11:39.840
or spin down.

11:42.680 --> 11:52.400
It turns out that the curve and the previous figure is directly proportional to the cosine squared function

11:52.400 --> 12:03.590
of half the tilting angle, that is this formula here, the probability that the to measure Espin up

12:03.590 --> 12:05.600
in this case, this is a.

12:06.670 --> 12:14.830
Particular example that we have done, but you can apply this to any angle or direction is that the

12:14.830 --> 12:21.730
P in function of data, the probability and the function of data is given by the causing the cosine

12:21.730 --> 12:24.400
squared of theta half.

12:26.860 --> 12:35.560
In physics, one formalizes this was an elegant formalism that puts all three igan states along a preferred

12:35.560 --> 12:37.870
that axis into one single description.

12:39.190 --> 12:43.590
For the sake of simplicity, let us restrict ourselves to that.

12:43.750 --> 12:44.530
Explain.

12:46.690 --> 12:53.410
Let us place for completeness, the queen cosine squared probability equation here again.

12:54.460 --> 13:01.960
And now the final spin up and spin down along that axis, as with a formula, formalism reminiscent

13:02.200 --> 13:10.960
of vectors and Cartesian two-dimensional plates, as we have already seen with this Spiner components.

13:12.250 --> 13:18.030
This so-called spinous, which, again, we should distinguish from the two dimensional Cartesian plane.

13:21.570 --> 13:28.250
But again, note that they represent, in any case, orthogonal quantum state matters.

13:28.410 --> 13:28.860
Uh.

13:29.800 --> 13:38.080
Recall how this product of orthogonal vectors is always zero, and this is something of this sort here

13:38.740 --> 13:47.530
where you have this color product of plus and minus get vectors along the Z axis in Spiner Coordinates

13:47.860 --> 13:57.100
is given as the complex conjugate of the first Spiner one zero and which is written horizontally the

13:57.100 --> 13:57.910
other vertically.

13:58.150 --> 14:06.870
They are summed up according to the product rules and laws and and and properties and you have it equal

14:06.910 --> 14:07.300
zero.

14:07.460 --> 14:08.440
This is simple.

14:10.020 --> 14:16.980
Algebra, linear algebra that you will find in every linear algebra textbook, and you probably many

14:16.980 --> 14:23.970
of you may have done this also at school, then the two Spiner equations, which still represent only

14:23.970 --> 14:32.550
two cases, the orientation for theta equals zero and data equals a hundred eighty degrees can be generalized

14:32.550 --> 14:36.600
to any anger in a single state as this one here.

14:38.250 --> 14:43.260
This object here, capital letters, are of wire of data.

14:43.290 --> 14:51.990
Why are Y of data is a rotation matrix which rotates the one zero Spiner.

14:53.050 --> 15:05.800
About a half about data and gives as output accused half data sign-off data Spiner, it is rotation

15:05.800 --> 15:12.910
matrix which transforms the spine of one zero into the spinal.

15:14.010 --> 15:21.990
Because I wanted to have signed that sign that I have rotating it about the y axis and.

15:23.030 --> 15:29.090
It represents a transformation which is induced by the rotation of the.

15:29.920 --> 15:37.230
S.G. magnets, these S.G. magnets perform a transformation on the state side.

15:37.490 --> 15:48.850
So any any on the state, that cat plus and return as a result, the state better say, um, this is

15:48.850 --> 15:49.860
a transformation.

15:50.380 --> 15:57.660
It might look like an observable acting on Spiner one zero that is on that cat.

15:57.700 --> 16:06.610
Plus, however, there is a subtle but the size of difference between transformation and an observation.

16:07.540 --> 16:15.160
And this, therefore, the rotation matrix does not really represent an observable.

16:15.970 --> 16:16.900
It is just.

16:18.420 --> 16:26.730
An object, a mathematical algebraic object, which represents the transformation of the state spectrum,

16:27.140 --> 16:30.590
will go into this subtlety later on.

16:31.110 --> 16:39.780
But for now, just remember that it is the rotation matrix is a transformation matrix, not a real observable.

16:42.020 --> 16:52.370
Then applying Bond's rule that is taking the model square of the state to say that we have given here

16:53.450 --> 17:01.970
gives, then finally as a result, the probability of having a specific outcome in our case led to observe

17:02.180 --> 17:13.250
a spin up particle, having rotated the Dan Glickman magnets by Ted that decrease the probability of

17:13.250 --> 17:23.750
theta equals the square of the bracket of PSI and which is obviously the cosine square that the have

17:24.350 --> 17:28.010
over sine squared at the half.

17:30.220 --> 17:37.720
This tells us that there is a Cusanus square, a high probability of measuring Espin up particle along

17:37.720 --> 17:43.710
an arbitrary direction, rotated relative to the Z axis of teta degrees.

17:44.410 --> 17:56.110
If it has prepared the Z Kate Plus State in line with the graph of the previous light and equiv, equivalently,

17:56.890 --> 18:06.460
sine squared 35 probability of measuring Espin down particle if it has been prepared in the set minds

18:06.470 --> 18:07.090
and state.

18:08.550 --> 18:15.830
The sum of the squared sine and cosine cosine functions always give independently from the angle one.

18:16.380 --> 18:20.520
Well, this is a normal algebraic identity.

18:20.880 --> 18:29.520
The cosine, cosine squared plus sine squared is always equal, one that is certainty as it should be,

18:29.700 --> 18:33.480
because it sums up over all possible outcomes.

18:35.360 --> 18:41.750
That is also why any transformation that transforms a state vector or wavefunction, maintaining the

18:41.750 --> 18:50.440
total probability invariant equal that is equal to one goes by the name of unitary transformation.

18:51.710 --> 18:57.680
Recall from what we have seen in the lecture on the state vector observables Schrodinger equation,

18:58.250 --> 19:07.280
how we defined there in that occasion and unitary operator, I read it here again, namely as an operator

19:07.280 --> 19:15.560
you that acts on the initial state function on time zero in such a manner that it evolves the state

19:15.560 --> 19:18.860
vector forwards or backwards in time.

19:19.960 --> 19:29.110
To a time T. But that leaves and alters the model, the square, that is the sum of all the probabilities

19:29.110 --> 19:30.550
of the possible outcomes.

19:30.910 --> 19:33.420
That is, it must be still one.

19:34.300 --> 19:39.670
And from which we follow the complex conjugate of the unitary operator, U.

19:40.120 --> 19:45.750
Times itself is equal the identity identity operator.

19:46.720 --> 19:58.750
So loosely speaking, we can say that the tilting of the Tangela magnets acts on the system of particles

19:58.750 --> 19:59.950
quantum particles.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.500
By unitary transformation.

20:02.800 --> 20:10.930
It transforms one state into the other, making one outcome less probable, but the other outcome more

20:10.930 --> 20:11.400
probable.

20:12.040 --> 20:14.790
But the sum of the probabilities remains the same.

20:15.250 --> 20:23.470
And this is called unitary transformation represented algebraically by this unitary operator.

20:23.950 --> 20:25.630
You capital letters.

20:27.970 --> 20:38.980
All this could in principle be also extended to the Weich plus minus 18 states, but we will not get

20:38.980 --> 20:40.270
into this subject here.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.430
It's just would be just a repetition.

20:43.210 --> 20:50.980
It may only be said that a comprehensive treatment leads to a beautiful, very beautiful algebra, which

20:51.250 --> 20:59.800
paved the way to a phenomenal mathematical development in quantum theory group theory representations

21:00.220 --> 21:09.070
and also so-called algebra's in quantum physics spins with its Spinosaurus are represented by the so-called

21:09.070 --> 21:14.700
special unitary group in two dimensions the the S.

21:14.710 --> 21:24.250
U two group, and which represents all the transformations that preserve the length of two dimensional

21:24.430 --> 21:32.890
complex vectors, which after all, reduces to what we already have said, the conservation of probability.

21:34.570 --> 21:40.300
However, don't dare to imagine this sort of rotation of complex vectors.

21:40.840 --> 21:47.050
It is a sort of weird three dimensional rotation inside a four dimensional space.

21:48.000 --> 21:58.210
So but this is now would be a very tricky issue of, uh, geometry, multidimensional geometry, and

21:58.210 --> 22:02.320
that we will not go into here from.

22:02.320 --> 22:11.110
This will also follow some very curious facts about the notion of rotation in the quantum world.

22:12.530 --> 22:17.810
And this is precisely what we will illustrate in the coming lecture.
