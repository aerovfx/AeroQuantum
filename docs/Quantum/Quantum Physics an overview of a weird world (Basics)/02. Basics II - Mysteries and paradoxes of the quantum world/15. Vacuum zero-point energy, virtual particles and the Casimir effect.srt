00:00.620 --> 00:09.680
Another interesting aspect of quantum theory is the so-called zero point energy of empty space, also

00:09.680 --> 00:18.350
called the zero point field, or more appropriately, the ground state energy of the vacuum, according

00:18.350 --> 00:25.610
to classical physics, which after all, reflects our intuitive understanding, empty space is just

00:25.610 --> 00:26.030
that.

00:26.150 --> 00:31.060
It is space devoid of anything except empty space itself.

00:32.270 --> 00:39.170
If you empty a volume of all its molecules, atoms and particles, and if you enclose this volume,

00:39.170 --> 00:48.320
say, in a hermetic box at the absolute zero temperature in order to empty it further also of any thermal

00:48.410 --> 00:51.950
radiation, recall the blocked dead body cavity.

00:52.640 --> 01:02.210
And if you isolate this box from any external influence or perturbation from the environment, then

01:02.210 --> 01:07.010
we think of this volume as being perfectly empty by definition.

01:08.270 --> 01:16.880
However, from a quantum perspective, things are not as simple as that, even if we pump out all the

01:16.880 --> 01:25.490
air until the last particle and molecule and atom and obtain perfect isolation at chilling temperatures,

01:26.120 --> 01:35.000
according to quantum mechanics, that space is still not really empty and the temperature still also

01:35.000 --> 01:37.820
not exactly absolute zero, as we see.

01:38.150 --> 01:46.580
Then later, we got a feeling in the preceding section of some phenomenon which have implicitly already

01:46.580 --> 01:47.630
suggested this.

01:48.350 --> 01:53.870
We studied Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the time, energy, uncertainty, quantum tunneling

01:53.870 --> 01:55.580
and the quantum tunneling effect.

01:56.090 --> 02:03.320
We saw that the energy of a particle in a box that is, for example, inside a potential such as, for

02:03.320 --> 02:12.260
example, the protons and neutrons inside the nucleus is in a ground state energy, and that cannot

02:12.260 --> 02:17.300
be reduced to zero and at the same time cannot be quantified.

02:17.300 --> 02:18.050
Exactly.

02:18.070 --> 02:26.720
And and this ground state energy can lead to effects such as radioactive decay at random times.

02:27.850 --> 02:36.520
All this together suggests as odd, it might seem that there is always a small amount of energy literally

02:36.520 --> 02:43.810
appearing from nothing, so to speak, and therefore it can do something that it classically would not

02:43.810 --> 02:44.630
be allowed to do.

02:46.330 --> 02:53.830
What then about the idea that if particles can be in a superposition of states, why not also in superposition

02:53.830 --> 02:58.570
of different energy states from these considerations?

02:58.720 --> 03:05.530
One can shift the reasoning also onto empty space or what is believed to be classically empty.

03:07.060 --> 03:11.650
Are we speaking, therefore, from of energy, from nothing, could that be true?

03:13.090 --> 03:21.050
Frequently you will see among textbooks of physicists talking about to popular science magazines, to

03:21.050 --> 03:28.630
a popular audience, to non-academic audiences, and approach to this question framed by invocation

03:28.630 --> 03:34.270
of Heisenberg's principle or the energy time of uncertainty.

03:36.220 --> 03:42.790
Sometimes, especially in the popular literature literature, one reads about the time uncertainty as

03:42.790 --> 03:47.370
a direct consequence of energy fluctuations in empty space.

03:48.610 --> 03:57.100
In this scenario, one thinks of empty space filled filled with a continuous fluctuating quantum energy

03:57.100 --> 04:05.530
form, which is allowed to violate for very short time intervals energy conservation, according to

04:05.530 --> 04:07.390
the time energy uncertainty.

04:08.850 --> 04:17.580
If we conceive of sufficiently small time lapses, Delta T, so goes the theory, the energy is indeterminate

04:18.000 --> 04:25.590
according to the time energy relation and at Mach microscopic scales for space intervals not larger

04:25.590 --> 04:28.260
than light can travel in the time interval.

04:29.070 --> 04:38.730
That is Delta X equals three times Delta T recall that we can imagine then energy popping into existence

04:39.330 --> 04:41.880
for a very brief moment and then.

04:42.760 --> 04:48.730
Popping out of existing existence, disappearing again in some sense.

04:49.790 --> 04:56.150
This might sound very convincing and could be taken as a first approach of understanding the nature

04:56.150 --> 05:04.100
of empty space in quantum physics, after all, where does that Delta E in the time, energy uncertainty

05:04.100 --> 05:05.070
relation come from?

05:05.690 --> 05:14.690
We expressly excluded any classical measurement error due to due to imperfect measurement devices.

05:15.680 --> 05:24.170
This little bit of energy that comes into or goes out of existence really remains something quite mysterious.

05:24.170 --> 05:31.250
If we recall that the energy conservation law is one of the most universally proven and accepted facts

05:31.250 --> 05:35.280
of classical physics, according to this law.

05:35.660 --> 05:39.110
Energy can be transformed but not destroyed.

05:39.560 --> 05:46.040
It can be transformed from heat into mechanical energy, chemical into electrical energy and so on.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.920
That can never be created or destroyed.

05:50.410 --> 05:58.420
Does quantum physics violate the principle of an energy conservation, a possible way out of this is

05:58.420 --> 06:04.050
to admit that the energy conservation law can be violated for an extremely short time.

06:05.020 --> 06:13.750
We have seen that a typical atomic transition lasts for about fractions of billions of a second and

06:13.930 --> 06:17.110
nuclear reactions are ever even shorter.

06:18.090 --> 06:26.500
But then the energy budget must be, so to speak, restored after the phenomenon has occurred.

06:27.300 --> 06:34.680
In other words, in quantum mechanics, tiny bits of energy are allowed to pop in and out of nothing,

06:34.920 --> 06:41.220
nothingness if they exist only for a time lapse, which is almost an instant.

06:42.480 --> 06:50.460
One also finds professional physicists talking somewhat improperly about borrowed energy from the vacuum.

06:51.320 --> 06:58.970
Calling it zero point energy, this is how the law of energy conservation can be saved on the classical

06:58.970 --> 07:01.790
and microscopic level as we perceive.

07:03.020 --> 07:11.540
A world in which the shortest time of which we can be aware of is no shorter than, say, a tenth of

07:11.540 --> 07:12.620
a second or so.

07:14.500 --> 07:22.930
While we can view things happening intuitively, according to this model, a more rigorous analysis

07:22.930 --> 07:23.980
shows that this.

07:24.890 --> 07:34.310
Extra energy is conceived of as a ground state of the vacuum and is obtained by the NONCOMMUTATIVE properties

07:34.520 --> 07:43.820
of observables, not through the time, energy, uncertainty relation, because as we pointed out in

07:43.820 --> 07:46.310
one of the previous sections, there is no time.

07:46.310 --> 07:53.090
Operator contrary to the position and momentum operators, zero point energy is not a consequence of

07:53.090 --> 07:56.280
time, energy, uncertainty, relation for the same.

07:57.020 --> 08:04.370
For this reason, the vacuum state is considered the lowest possible quantum state of empty space and

08:04.370 --> 08:06.590
is obtained in quantum field theory.

08:06.860 --> 08:13.490
That is an extension of classical quantum mechanics by a mathematical procedure which goes by the name

08:13.490 --> 08:15.500
of second quantization.

08:16.070 --> 08:23.870
The first quantization is the one we introduced in this course here the interaction of operators for

08:23.870 --> 08:30.830
observables and which replaced the classical notion of Newtonian mechanics that the dynamic variables

08:30.830 --> 08:32.630
of the Newtonian mechanics.

08:33.410 --> 08:39.200
The second quantization replaces the concept of the particle with a field motion and works with special

08:39.200 --> 08:43.100
relativity, even though still not general relativity.

08:44.300 --> 08:51.200
A field in the quantum field theory is defined in space and time.

08:51.680 --> 08:59.360
So as the second quantization and in quantum field theory replace, you make a secondary placement where

09:00.110 --> 09:07.640
instead of the particle, you replace the particle with a field motion and which is defined in spacetime.

09:08.990 --> 09:18.800
And it does so by expanding the operators again as itself as a sum of more fundamental operators called

09:18.800 --> 09:21.740
the annihilation or creation apparatus.

09:22.520 --> 09:31.220
That is by a mathematical procedure which quantities every point in space and time in terms of harmonic

09:31.220 --> 09:38.510
oscillators and which is able to correctly describe special relativity, relativistic quantum mechanical

09:38.510 --> 09:39.040
phenomena.

09:40.400 --> 09:46.940
Quantum field theory is a mathematical, quite complicated theory, which, however, describes successively

09:46.940 --> 09:49.340
the standard model of particle physics.

09:50.240 --> 09:56.840
It is not necessary to describe it here in detail, since from a foundational point of view, it does

09:56.840 --> 09:59.340
not really introduce many novelties.

10:00.380 --> 10:10.580
However, the important point to keep in mind is that that it is from this that physicists obtain from

10:10.580 --> 10:19.880
their calculations and non-zero ground state energy vacuum and which can be imagined somewhat inappropriately

10:20.090 --> 10:25.400
as a quantum form in which every spacetime point fluctuates.

10:26.810 --> 10:34.580
In this interpretation, we do not perceive these fluctuations at large spatial scales because they

10:34.580 --> 10:43.010
become relevant only for small microscopic regions and also for extremely small time intervals.

10:43.820 --> 10:51.920
Just as a small rippling on the surface of an apparently perfectly flat object might be invisible to

10:51.920 --> 10:52.420
the eye.

10:52.910 --> 11:00.170
If you were to look at it through a microscope, you might discover it to be very rough instead, just

11:00.170 --> 11:02.050
to use this analogy.

11:02.480 --> 11:12.830
In fact, if we continued zooming into space regions as small as ten to the power minus 34 meter, which

11:12.830 --> 11:24.350
is an incredibly small scale, it is a number which is written as a zero, followed by other 33 zeros

11:24.350 --> 11:30.080
after the comma until you reach the first non-zero digit meters.

11:30.680 --> 11:38.180
And this is called the so-called Planck scale, because Planck was the first to describe it.

11:39.050 --> 11:45.390
And empty space, empty space is considered, therefore, to be full of these energy fluctuations.

11:46.340 --> 11:55.370
This is often depicted as a spacetime form, as sort of white noise pervading empty space at very small

11:55.370 --> 12:03.990
scales as shown in the in the last magnification of the right hand side of this graph here.

12:04.010 --> 12:04.430
This.

12:04.430 --> 12:05.000
This.

12:06.120 --> 12:15.980
Noisy objects here and which is somehow pictorially artistically depicted also here.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.730
Is this an animated Jeff?

12:19.230 --> 12:27.210
At these spatial scales, space is no longer empty, but a place where any sort of extremely fast bubbling,

12:27.210 --> 12:36.800
energetic even's in extremely short time spends Arcore about ten to the minus forty four seconds.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.780
This is called the Planck Time.

12:40.770 --> 12:45.510
And do your homework and see how short this time is.

12:45.520 --> 12:51.990
And there's nothing that we can do that we know of that is has such a short time.

12:51.990 --> 13:02.750
And even also the most precise clocks are far, far from being able to measure such short time intervals.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.950
But that's what the calculations tell us.

13:06.360 --> 13:13.440
And so the energy state of the vacuum in quantum mechanics is not zero zero point energy, despite what

13:13.440 --> 13:22.110
the somewhat misleading name might suggest, is not a point at which that the energy is zero, but rather

13:22.110 --> 13:25.590
a non-zero energy ground state of the vacuum.

13:28.030 --> 13:36.430
A word of caution about the concept of quantum fluctuation, you might frequently hear the general public

13:36.430 --> 13:42.400
and often often also physicists, too, speaking of these quantum fluctuations of the vacuum at small

13:42.400 --> 13:49.860
scales we have done this year to pictorially because this is Smeets, our intuition.

13:49.870 --> 13:51.940
It's easy to speak in these terms.

13:53.160 --> 13:59.490
It is an interpretation that might be useful for an intuitive understanding, but it isn't entirely

13:59.490 --> 14:06.690
correct, a more rigorous way to interpret the quantum mechanical vacuum state is not that of describing

14:06.690 --> 14:12.690
it with fluctuating energy states, but rather with quantum with a quantum superposition.

14:13.650 --> 14:16.980
Also, atomic energy states can be in superposition.

14:17.700 --> 14:22.280
The excited and non excited energy state of an atom can be realized at the same time.

14:23.430 --> 14:27.490
We know how particles can be also in two places at the same time.

14:28.260 --> 14:31.600
That's what we have learned with quantum superposition principle.

14:32.460 --> 14:36.160
The same holds for the spin and their magnetic momentum.

14:36.450 --> 14:46.680
We saw that measuring the spin on one along one axis renders undetermined the spin value plus or minus

14:46.710 --> 14:53.540
on the other axis because the observables of the spin, the spin observers do not commute.

14:54.180 --> 14:57.770
And we said that they are in a superposition state.

14:58.170 --> 15:07.320
We didn't speak of fluctuating spins that flip the flip from one value to the other, up or down spin,

15:07.320 --> 15:14.610
plus or minus the same holds also for molecules or any other objects.

15:15.480 --> 15:23.430
There are no limits in principle where quantum superposition holds and when a measurement or interaction

15:23.430 --> 15:27.990
occurs, only one of the possible states is observed.

15:28.140 --> 15:34.050
And a state projection, of course, but nothing is fluctuating there.

15:34.270 --> 15:37.220
This is so important to keep in mind.

15:38.610 --> 15:42.120
So this is the same fits for the energy of the vacuum.

15:42.600 --> 15:51.330
It can be in superposition of possible energy states and only one of the these actualise is when observed

15:51.330 --> 15:54.660
or as we shall see now, when particles interact.

15:55.980 --> 16:05.010
So in this sense, there are no fluctuations of states, despite what the common language and common

16:05.160 --> 16:09.930
discourse between physicists and also in the popular media, you will hear that.

16:09.930 --> 16:16.560
But this is there is a superposition of states and the subsequent realization of one of the potential

16:16.560 --> 16:17.850
evens by a measurement.

16:18.620 --> 16:21.160
Which is a very different thing.

16:22.610 --> 16:29.690
At the microscopic level and for a very short time intervals, empty space is in a superposition of

16:29.690 --> 16:30.470
energy states.

16:31.020 --> 16:37.940
On the other hand, what really fluctuates are the outcomes we obtain at each measurement.

16:38.030 --> 16:46.640
Statistically, if we perform several extremely fast measurements looking at empty space, we would

16:46.640 --> 16:50.000
obtain a set of fluctuating, fluctuating data.

16:50.880 --> 16:58.020
But again, this has nothing to do with the imperfections of the measurement device, and it is nothing

16:58.020 --> 16:59.550
to do with fluctuations.

17:00.030 --> 17:03.330
It is an intrinsic property of the quantum.

17:04.550 --> 17:12.470
Universe, so to speak, this is another example of how in quantum physics, we must be very careful

17:12.470 --> 17:19.660
with the counterfactual definiteness reasoning which must be applied with great care.

17:20.150 --> 17:29.030
The fact that measurement results fluctuate does not imply that the system we are measuring fluctuates

17:29.030 --> 17:31.610
in time from one state to another.

17:32.550 --> 17:40.760
And this leads us to the next step, that of the conception of virtual particles in this scenario,

17:40.800 --> 17:49.170
one also conceives of the existence of virtual particles filling empty space and popping in and out

17:49.170 --> 17:50.010
of existence.

17:51.190 --> 17:59.530
In fact, if empty space can be filled for short times with small microscopic regions of non-zero energy

17:59.530 --> 18:07.450
states, we can also think of the vacuum as being filled with particles, having that energy as photons

18:07.450 --> 18:08.680
or even with the mass.

18:08.920 --> 18:15.460
According to the famous Einstein mass energy relation, which states and equivalence between mass and

18:15.460 --> 18:25.870
energy as equal EMC squared photons or even massive particles like electrons or protons are allowed

18:25.870 --> 18:33.340
to come into the exist into existence from empty space and almost instantly disappear.

18:34.210 --> 18:41.410
This might seem a bit too far fetched of an idea, this idea that of particles pop into existence out

18:41.410 --> 18:43.730
of nothing, just out of the blue.

18:43.940 --> 18:52.570
So but the fact is, once accepted, the whole quantum field theory resulting from this assumption is

18:52.570 --> 18:59.350
just that theory which turned out to be the right the right one, and which was tested experimentally

18:59.350 --> 19:05.850
many times to clarify the meaning of virtual particles and quantum mechanics.

19:06.190 --> 19:10.720
Think of two approaching particles as two electrons in this image.

19:12.640 --> 19:19.420
This is one of the typical diagrams called also Feynman diagrams, diagrams that we will discuss in

19:19.420 --> 19:20.450
more detail later.

19:21.310 --> 19:30.280
It is a different way of conceiving of force fields no longer as continuous regions surrounding a particle

19:30.280 --> 19:40.270
or a body like the gravitational or electric field of classical physics, but as particles that exchange

19:40.420 --> 19:41.800
other force particles.

19:42.850 --> 19:50.020
This is one of the main aspects that distinguish quantum field theory from a classical one feels are

19:50.020 --> 19:56.890
quantized here when the electrons approach and come sufficiently close to each other.

19:57.370 --> 20:01.150
The reason there is this region of space that separates them.

20:01.780 --> 20:09.370
The so-called vertex region is so small that due to the vacuum energy, a certain amount of energy becomes

20:09.370 --> 20:14.860
available, so to speak, though only for a very short period of time.

20:15.880 --> 20:23.200
During this brief time interval, zero point energy manifests in form of a virtual particle here, a

20:23.200 --> 20:26.160
virtual photon in this case here in this diagram.

20:26.710 --> 20:34.690
But it can be also massive particles with the mass and which is exchanged between the two electron electrons,

20:34.690 --> 20:40.930
resulting in an impulse exchange debating them from each other.

20:42.730 --> 20:46.010
They have the same charge and therefore must repel each other.

20:46.030 --> 20:50.680
That is, we are talking about a scattering process here all the time.

20:51.220 --> 20:58.270
Energy uncertainty tells us that the distance between the two electrons must be small enough that the

20:58.270 --> 21:04.780
photon can travel from one electron to the other in a shorter time than that allowed by the time and

21:04.780 --> 21:05.920
energy uncertainty.

21:07.330 --> 21:12.540
Then at the end of this force exchange process, the photon must be absorbed.

21:12.850 --> 21:15.100
That is, it ceases to exist.

21:16.750 --> 21:23.560
Virtual particles can never be observed directly and do not exist in the same way that other particles

21:23.560 --> 21:31.390
do, we might say that they pop in and out of existence for that short time period in and in that tiny

21:31.390 --> 21:39.310
space volume to allow for force and momentum, exchange for the scattering process to occur.

21:40.150 --> 21:46.030
However, they cannot be compared to other real particles that can be absorbed directly.

21:47.140 --> 21:53.920
That is why, after all, they are called virtual particles and they are not real in your usual sense.

21:54.920 --> 22:03.380
Things a bit more intricate, and we will see this in more detail when we talk about Fischman path integrals

22:03.380 --> 22:04.210
and diagrams.

22:05.030 --> 22:12.230
However, for the moment, for the moment, this might be an image that can help our intuitive understanding

22:12.230 --> 22:12.860
of things.

22:14.060 --> 22:22.490
Another question might be to ask ourselves if these visualisations represent a real process.

22:23.550 --> 22:29.650
Do virtual particles really exist out there, as in the film and diagrams?

22:30.840 --> 22:39.850
The fact is that Feynman's approach was extraordinarily successful in describing particle physics with

22:39.850 --> 22:46.260
the theory that today goes by the name of the standard model of particle physics based on five months

22:46.560 --> 22:56.880
quantum electrodynamics, so-called QED, and was confirmed by a large number of experiments in particles

22:56.880 --> 22:58.370
in particle accelerators.

22:59.550 --> 23:08.310
There can be no doubt that the theory is such mathematically, abstractly is correct, and it calculates

23:08.310 --> 23:10.740
correctly the phenomenon we observe.

23:12.140 --> 23:19.190
However, we must be aware of the fact that Feynman diagrams represent only an intuitive tool for our

23:19.190 --> 23:28.420
limited human mind to depict interactions, the complexity of which escapes our cognitive abilities,

23:29.060 --> 23:37.160
they are an attempt to force into the rhythm of the microcosm our classical representation of objects

23:37.640 --> 23:40.160
in the area of the macrocosm.

23:41.740 --> 23:45.280
Another proof regarding how a quantum.

23:47.030 --> 23:56.120
Vacuum can manifest its quantum superposition state, which reveals itself as ripples of energy over

23:56.120 --> 24:04.160
a large space volume, comes paradoxically from a completely different region, one that is the opposite

24:04.160 --> 24:07.910
of the microscopic world, namely from cosmology.

24:08.990 --> 24:15.020
We have already hinted at this in the lecture on the black body radiation, but it is worth to mention

24:15.290 --> 24:17.800
what this image is thought to represent.

24:18.680 --> 24:26.690
According to modern Big Bang theories, all the matter and energy of the universe was once concentrated

24:26.690 --> 24:34.130
in such a tiny volume that quantum mechanical effects were very relevant during its first instance of

24:34.130 --> 24:34.640
birth.

24:35.650 --> 24:43.780
Even if all the matter were distributed in a perfectly and ideally homogeneous manner, the quantum

24:43.780 --> 24:52.510
effects of the vacuum must have caused tiny in homogeneity that should be observable in today's microwave

24:52.510 --> 24:56.350
cosmic background radiation or shortly GNB.

24:57.710 --> 25:02.810
So these vacuum fluctuations or quantum effects?

25:03.940 --> 25:13.330
Caused tiny ripples in the GMB radiation, even though these ripples of income in homogeneity of the

25:13.330 --> 25:15.490
cosmic background are very tiny.

25:15.700 --> 25:22.390
In fact, they are only if they depart from the cosmic background, two point seven Kelvin temperature

25:22.390 --> 25:25.660
of only a few thousands of degrees.

25:26.890 --> 25:32.140
These ripples could be confirmed by measurements from satellites in space.

25:33.570 --> 25:42.180
The cosmic microwave background radiation is one of the many examples one can make to show how the idea

25:42.180 --> 25:48.750
of the quantum vacuum is not just a fancy theoretical speculation, but the reality of the physical

25:48.750 --> 25:49.190
world.

25:50.490 --> 25:58.400
However, particle physicist instead take as proof of the existence of the zero point quantum vacuum,

25:58.590 --> 26:06.780
vacuum energy and the existence of virtual particles, an experiment performed by the Dutch physicist

26:07.260 --> 26:09.240
Henrik Kazimir.

26:10.370 --> 26:18.050
In the Casimir effect, the ground state of the quaintest electromagnetic field, that is the electromagnetic

26:18.050 --> 26:26.390
vacuum energy, which can also be seen as mediated by virtual photons popping in and out of existence,

26:27.230 --> 26:35.540
is thought to be responsible for the attraction between two almost perfectly flat, parallel and uncharged

26:35.540 --> 26:41.990
metal plates distanced from each other by only a few micrometers.

26:43.450 --> 26:48.910
According to the standard interpretation, the Kazimir forces arise because the ground state of the

26:48.910 --> 26:56.200
vacuum between the plates will have different electromagnetic modal configurations than that of the

26:56.200 --> 27:06.310
outside vacuum as its ground states are constrained by the two metal walls, sort of the modes we considered

27:06.310 --> 27:08.290
in the black book black body cavity.

27:09.580 --> 27:17.800
This implies that the literal photons inside the plates have a different energy than those outside it.

27:19.230 --> 27:26.940
This leads to a difference in the energy density between the two spatial regions inside and outside

27:26.940 --> 27:32.220
the plates and produces a force pulling the plates together.

27:32.850 --> 27:35.580
And this is called the Kazimir Force.

27:36.960 --> 27:41.280
The variation of energy in space does always produce a force.

27:41.580 --> 27:49.770
So you should remember this, that every time that there is some differential in the energy, it means

27:49.770 --> 27:52.250
a variation of energy in space or time.

27:52.830 --> 27:56.730
Then in some way or another, a force arises.

27:58.650 --> 28:04.830
This effect has been repeatedly tested with increasing precision since then, confirming the theory

28:04.980 --> 28:06.710
that predicted it predicted it.

28:07.740 --> 28:14.310
Therefore, one he several physicists referring to the Casimir effect as evidence for its zero point

28:14.310 --> 28:21.420
energy that is a form of virtual particles supposedly filling empty space.

28:22.950 --> 28:28.680
However, some physicists do not share this view, despite the popularity of this interpretation.

28:29.400 --> 28:38.130
In fact, Kazimir himself originally described the same phenomenon as an effect of Wonderfalls forces.

28:38.970 --> 28:47.460
Wonder why advance forces are intermolecular forces responsible for the attractive or repulsive forces

28:47.460 --> 28:52.260
between polarizer molecules at short distances.

28:54.570 --> 29:00.760
The Kazimir forces can be described as an interaction between the materials.

29:01.440 --> 29:07.440
The reason why in quantum physics that zero point energy interpretation prevailed is that with this

29:07.440 --> 29:13.860
theory and for elementary quantum particles or structures one encounters, usually the mathematical

29:13.860 --> 29:16.060
calculations are easier to perform.

29:16.890 --> 29:20.940
This is not because it adds something new to the physical picture.

29:21.840 --> 29:27.300
In fact, in chemistry and biology, scientists prefer to speak of.

29:27.300 --> 29:30.150
But there was forces at any rate.

29:30.180 --> 29:36.360
However, one interprets sarcasm, enforces the most amazing and unexpected display of this effect in

29:36.360 --> 29:43.770
nature comes from the animal kingdom, from the tiny and elegant lizards, which are the geckos.

29:45.330 --> 29:53.160
Most members of the species are quite skillful at climbing walls or any kind of flat surface, like

29:53.160 --> 29:56.550
for, for instance, a vertical glass window.

29:57.150 --> 30:04.830
This ability comes from their abrasive toe pads, which enable attractive vanderveldt forces between

30:04.830 --> 30:07.320
the so-called Sitti structures.

30:07.530 --> 30:13.140
That is the stiff hair like or dislike structures and the surface.

30:13.920 --> 30:18.450
These bristles are approximately five micrometers in diameter.

30:19.230 --> 30:26.240
Just to make a comparison, the smallest human human hair is about 15 to 20 micrometers.

30:27.300 --> 30:33.260
The use of the small one attraction forces require very large surface areas.

30:33.960 --> 30:42.870
Every square millimeter of geko foot pad contains about 14000 hair like Sitti.

30:43.760 --> 30:53.270
The end of each sector consists of approximately 3000 spottily, that is structures, structures shaped

30:53.270 --> 30:55.970
like an isosceles triangle.

30:56.870 --> 31:06.780
The Spatola are approximately 200 nanometres on one side and 10 to 30 nanometres on the other two sides.

31:07.400 --> 31:12.260
These structures are invisible because they are below the wavelength of visible light.

31:12.470 --> 31:16.610
So you can't see them even not with some optical microscope.

31:16.610 --> 31:21.140
You need an electron microscope or some other microscope that does not work with light.

31:21.500 --> 31:32.540
And this plethora of Spatola all act like tiny Kazimi Kazimir plates, which together sum up to an additive

31:32.540 --> 31:38.720
force allowing the gecko to climb walls without further aid.

31:38.930 --> 31:45.170
I wanted to conclude this lecture with this example just to show how the zero point energy determines

31:45.170 --> 31:47.920
our existence in so many different contexts.
