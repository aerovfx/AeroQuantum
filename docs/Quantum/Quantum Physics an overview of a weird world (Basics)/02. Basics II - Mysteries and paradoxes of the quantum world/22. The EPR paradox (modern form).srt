00:00.770 --> 00:09.800
The EPR paradox in its original form with the opposition momentum measurement is technically, in practical

00:09.800 --> 00:11.870
terms, quite difficult to make.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.360
For a long time, it remained a thought experiment that was impossible to realize.

00:18.500 --> 00:25.440
Originally, David Boehme tried to translate the paradox into its spin analog.

00:26.090 --> 00:35.120
He proposed using electron positron pairs that are created by a decay process, more precisely by a

00:35.150 --> 00:44.420
neutral Pye meson subatomic particle that can be produced in an accelerated accelerator collision process

00:44.420 --> 00:49.400
and that quickly decays in an electron and positron pair.

00:50.210 --> 00:56.460
And these have a total of zero angular momentum that is zero total spin.

00:56.780 --> 01:08.720
So in principle, these could be used as entangled particles to make experiments on most of modern experiments.

01:08.720 --> 01:15.440
Testing quantum mechanics rely on the measurement of the computational relation of the spin absorbers,

01:15.740 --> 01:18.460
not the position of many observers.

01:19.490 --> 01:26.210
In fact, throughout the modern literature, you will usually usually find the EPR experiment explains

01:26.330 --> 01:30.140
straight away with the particles intrinsic angular momentum.

01:31.260 --> 01:39.750
And the advent of modern technologies, modern electronics, lasers, quantum electro optics, devices

01:39.750 --> 01:42.740
and so on made this feasible.

01:43.020 --> 01:53.280
It is possible nowadays it's relatively easy to measure the spins and properties of photons much better

01:53.280 --> 02:00.210
than single material particles such as positrons, electrons or other particles.

02:00.660 --> 02:07.230
Lasers are technically an easier and cheaper option, and modern experiments use photons.

02:07.380 --> 02:10.170
That is, particles with integrase spin.

02:11.960 --> 02:19.070
To produce the entangled photons, physicists, physicists, use laser beams that excite the atoms of

02:19.070 --> 02:31.550
some particular substance, usually so-called beta barium borate, crystal or shortly also be OK in

02:31.550 --> 02:38.920
such a way that it really emits the absorbed energy in the form of entangled photons.

02:39.770 --> 02:46.480
And obviously with some special polarizations or Telecity that is spin.

02:47.560 --> 02:54.450
We will go deeper into the subject of entangled photons in some later lecture.

02:55.340 --> 03:03.380
For now, just keep in mind that in the case of an entangled system, you will never know which of the

03:03.380 --> 03:10.880
two particles will show up with up and down spin or four photons, the left or right handed polarization.

03:11.860 --> 03:21.100
So for this reason, with these facts in mind, it is worthwhile to reformulate the EPA paradox in its

03:21.100 --> 03:22.120
modern version.

03:23.250 --> 03:31.920
To visualize Epirus thought, experiment with the spin operators, suppose the two entangled particles

03:31.920 --> 03:40.290
with opposite spins and zero total angular momentum that is in a single state have been produced by

03:40.290 --> 03:45.850
some source and fly apart in opposite directions towards two observers.

03:46.740 --> 03:50.760
Let us call them Alice and Bob, like a..

03:50.760 --> 03:51.270
Figure here.

03:53.430 --> 04:03.420
If the two particles are entangled and if Alice will measure, say, along an axis that spin up, that

04:03.420 --> 04:04.140
is that.

04:04.320 --> 04:13.680
Plus she can send this information to Bob who without any measurement on his particle, will deduce

04:13.680 --> 04:20.130
that it must be in the opposite spin state, namely that that mean minus state.

04:21.060 --> 04:28.770
Now, Bob can instead measure along a different axis, for example, the x axis.

04:30.310 --> 04:33.210
Let's say that Bob gets a.

04:34.250 --> 04:43.460
XCAP plus spin state, then he returned the favor and sends a message about his particle's state to

04:43.460 --> 04:43.970
Ellis.

04:45.220 --> 04:54.700
Therefore, she concludes that the state of her article along the X axis should be X minus again without

04:54.700 --> 04:58.720
having performed such a measurement on her particle.

04:59.620 --> 05:06.880
At this point, both might believe that they have the full set of information about the two observables

05:07.060 --> 05:16.150
for their own particles, the spin along the X, Y and Z axis, but having measured only one of them

05:16.150 --> 05:25.390
on each particle while reducing the other indirectly after being informed through some standard communication

05:25.390 --> 05:25.810
channel.

05:27.410 --> 05:38.900
Ellis particle must be therefore in that court plus X minus state, while Bob's particle must be in

05:39.800 --> 05:48.680
that minus X, Kate plus state, and neither of them had to measure the particles along both axis.

05:50.420 --> 05:57.680
However, we know this is not allowed according to standard quantum mechanics, which imposes the commutation

05:57.700 --> 06:04.640
relations on the spin operators and which tells us that it is strictly forbidden to obtain both spin

06:04.640 --> 06:13.940
states at once because that commutator of as that and as X is not equal zero.

06:16.160 --> 06:24.140
So the question is, do the two particles really possess objectively these spin's properties along the

06:24.140 --> 06:24.980
two axis?

06:24.980 --> 06:34.220
At the same time, we already saw with the Tangela experiment that this is highly doubtful, to say

06:34.220 --> 06:36.510
the least, in any event.

06:36.530 --> 06:43.100
The problem with all this here is that if we want to answer this question, we will have to measure

06:43.490 --> 06:51.530
Alize particle along the X axis, while Bob will also have to make a second measurement along the Z

06:51.530 --> 06:56.230
axis to be certain to be sure that this is the case.

06:57.530 --> 07:04.040
We know that the laws of quantum mechanics, strictly forbidden, forbids this and we know how it would

07:04.040 --> 07:04.430
end.

07:04.430 --> 07:13.970
If they did so, it would again render indeterminate as Z for Ellis' and as X for Bob.

07:15.330 --> 07:22.320
The only thing that is sure is that a strong correlation exists between the two particles.

07:23.940 --> 07:31.290
So if you understood the paradox in its original version with the opposition momentum, the termination

07:31.290 --> 07:37.470
of a couple of particles, then you should be able to recognize it in this more modern version, which

07:37.470 --> 07:45.600
resorts to the spin of particles, both versions are substantially equivalent in the sense that they

07:45.600 --> 07:53.120
seem to imply that the cumulate computation relations of quantum mechanics could in principle be violated.

07:53.640 --> 08:01.530
And if so, this would vindicate Einstein's strong conviction that quantum mechanics must somehow be

08:01.530 --> 08:09.090
an incomplete theory and that a more refined and better theory must exist possible based on hidden variables

08:09.270 --> 08:12.060
which would explain things better without paradoxes.

08:13.370 --> 08:22.310
However, historically, it should be noted that when this interesting paper of Epper appeared, it

08:22.310 --> 08:30.560
did not attract attention at all, even though one of its authors, Einstein, was a globally known

08:30.560 --> 08:32.120
high ranking physicist.

08:33.290 --> 08:43.790
Nevertheless, almost nobody cited the article, and it remained completely ignored for almost three

08:43.790 --> 08:46.090
decades, 30 years.

08:47.070 --> 08:55.940
This was quite characteristic of the spirit of the time during which almost all physicists embraced

08:55.940 --> 09:03.860
the Copenhagen interpretation and stopped thinking about these more foundational and philosophical aspects

09:03.860 --> 09:05.000
of quantum mechanics.

09:06.050 --> 09:15.890
Action was considered an old man who would had his moments in the sun, but who was no longer able to

09:15.890 --> 09:19.310
produce new and original contributions.

09:20.810 --> 09:27.110
Yet history has shown that Epper were probably too far ahead of their time.

09:27.980 --> 09:38.750
The fact that the technology required to perform epis experiments or like was still not mature was not

09:38.750 --> 09:42.040
the only reason why they were ignored.

09:42.890 --> 09:46.610
It was an evolutionary necessity, so to speak.

09:46.830 --> 09:53.070
The culture of the time and minds were not ready to focus on the subjects.

09:53.750 --> 09:58.760
This changed in the late 1960s with Bell's theorem.

09:59.720 --> 10:09.110
But before we analyze EPA's legacy in the light of bells in intellectual achievement as a logical continuation

10:09.110 --> 10:17.510
of the spirit of investigations into the foundations of quantum mechanics, let us first focus on the

10:17.510 --> 10:21.620
other issue that of the faster than light transmissions.
