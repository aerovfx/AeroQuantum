00:00.730 --> 00:08.980
Another interesting effect that you will find in the rhythm of the quantum world is the so-called quantum

00:08.980 --> 00:10.250
tunneling effect.

00:11.170 --> 00:18.980
It is a strange phenomenon that emerges quite naturally once the time energy relation, the Heisenberg's

00:19.000 --> 00:26.930
uncertainty relation and the wave particle principle expressed by the debris relation are taken together.

00:27.790 --> 00:34.750
This implies that we have to expect very different behaviors between classical, mechanical and quantum

00:34.750 --> 00:35.430
objects.

00:36.400 --> 00:45.130
For instance, according to classical mechanics, we can throw an object over a wall only if it has

00:45.130 --> 00:52.600
a sufficient kinetic energy that can overcome the wall, which means more precisely, that there is

00:52.600 --> 01:01.060
enough kinetic energy that can be transformed into potential energy to reach the hate, the hate of

01:01.060 --> 01:02.800
the top of the wall wall.

01:04.700 --> 01:11.150
If it does not have that or more speed in the form of kinetic energy to overcome this potential barrier,

01:11.810 --> 01:18.950
it will hit the wall and eventually bounce back by more and more or less elastic or inelastic reflection.

01:20.390 --> 01:24.360
However, in quantum mechanics, things are a bit different.

01:25.160 --> 01:33.980
Any object's position and energy is due to Heisenberg's time, energy, uncertainty, always a bit uncertain,

01:34.250 --> 01:42.280
intrinsically fuzzy and smeared out over an average value and the figure for simplicity.

01:42.530 --> 01:51.800
We depicted the classical trajectory here with a solid line while the dashed lines stand for the quantum

01:51.800 --> 01:52.640
fuzziness.

01:54.730 --> 02:04.000
And this now is in turn means that due to this slight but sometimes, sometimes not negligible degree

02:04.000 --> 02:13.510
of uncertainty, a quantum particle which was prepared with a kinetic energy of a value near to that

02:13.510 --> 02:22.960
necessary to jump over the wall, but still classically insufficient to do that might yet possess due

02:22.960 --> 02:25.150
to this Quantum added.

02:26.110 --> 02:33.670
And certain quantum uncertainty might possess that little bit of additional energy that will eventually

02:33.670 --> 02:36.610
allow it to overcome the barrier.

02:38.470 --> 02:46.510
Therefore, in quantum physics, it is always possible, though usually with low probability, that

02:46.510 --> 02:54.610
sometimes particle will be able to overcome an obstacle, even if they have a slightly lower kinetic

02:54.610 --> 02:59.990
energy than that which is classically necessary, necessary to overcome it.

03:01.810 --> 03:08.890
This classically not allowed slipping through a barrier is called quantum tunneling.

03:11.590 --> 03:17.860
This was a bit of a down to earth and intuitive way to put things, a more rigorous understanding of

03:17.860 --> 03:27.900
quantum tunneling can be achieved if we also recall that the particles have a wave character, they

03:28.000 --> 03:30.690
due to the particle wave particle duality.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.800
We can describe them also with waves.

03:33.610 --> 03:40.960
With this perspective, we no longer conceive of a particle hitting a wall as a point like or eventually

03:40.960 --> 03:45.700
extend that well defined object which overcomes it or not.

03:46.660 --> 03:55.570
But rather we will visualize it as a travelling probability wave, which is in part reflected and in

03:55.570 --> 03:57.640
part transmitted through the barrier.

03:58.060 --> 04:06.370
Just like a light rail can be partially reflected and transmitted by a glass plate, a wave can do to

04:06.400 --> 04:13.930
diffraction effects be deviated from classical path, especially at the boundary of a sharp edge.

04:15.140 --> 04:23.010
In microscopic structures, it is more realistic to think of thin, atomic or molecular layers.

04:23.780 --> 04:32.240
These two are barriers that, for the sake of simplicity, can be approximated as a step function like

04:32.240 --> 04:32.900
this one.

04:32.900 --> 04:41.600
In this figure here, if you insert the wavefunction into the Schrodinger's equation and constrain the

04:41.600 --> 04:51.230
particle appropriately with the potential V of X, which represents the barrier, then you will obtain

04:51.230 --> 05:00.260
a different solution for the wave function BPCI of X before inside and after the barrier he ipsi of

05:00.260 --> 05:08.450
X is shown instead of its model of square and to show how the solution behaves inside and outside of

05:08.450 --> 05:08.870
the well.

05:09.820 --> 05:18.220
In the upper figure, you can see the image, imaginary and real parts of the wave function and how

05:18.760 --> 05:27.910
this is reflected and transmitted through the potential barrier in the lower figure, an analog representation.

05:28.450 --> 05:34.660
However, in this time, with a model squared of the wave function, that is, it is represented as

05:34.660 --> 05:45.940
a probability wave on one side, the left part of the figure here and incoming and reflected probability

05:45.940 --> 05:53.510
wave will overlap, that is, interfere and result in the left standing wave.

05:54.040 --> 06:01.600
Again, in principle, a similar standing wave effect that we saw for orbitals or in the black body

06:01.600 --> 06:02.740
radiation cavity.

06:04.770 --> 06:11.670
Inside the barrier, one gets an exponentially decaying wave function, which means an exponentially

06:11.670 --> 06:17.930
decaying probability with the thickness of the barrier of finding the particle inside it.

06:19.230 --> 06:28.320
But for the transmitted wave after the barrier, another solution will result and oscillating non-zero

06:28.320 --> 06:35.940
solution, implying a non-zero probability to find the particle having tunneled through the barrier.

06:37.180 --> 06:44.800
So before the barrier, there are several regions where we will find the particle being reflected since

06:44.950 --> 06:51.730
its kinetic energy was not sufficient to penetrate the barrier, at least classically, but there is

06:51.730 --> 06:56.220
also a small probability to find it after the barrier as well.

06:57.480 --> 07:03.360
Despite the fact that the classically did not have sufficient in the energy, kinetic energy to do so.

07:05.040 --> 07:15.780
Statistically, that means that multiple particles, even if all are prepared in the exact same kinetic

07:15.930 --> 07:23.760
kinetic energy again state, must have nevertheless slightly different energy values distributed over

07:23.760 --> 07:32.770
a mean energy due to the uncertainty that governs the quantum world due to the energy time uncertainty.

07:32.790 --> 07:40.860
For example, while most are reflected, a few will nevertheless make it through because these few will

07:40.860 --> 07:48.600
have a slightly higher energy content than the average value and which is considered the classical mechanical

07:48.600 --> 07:56.220
one and will be able to penetrate nevertheless the potential barrier, even though they were prepared

07:56.520 --> 07:59.280
in a lower energy, energetic state.

08:01.240 --> 08:08.800
This is in stark contrast to the classical behavior, where if a number of particles all have the same

08:08.800 --> 08:12.220
energy, they will all behave together in the same way.

08:12.700 --> 08:17.900
They will all bounce back or all jump over the obstacle.

08:19.210 --> 08:27.490
Nobody has been seen to be able to walk through a wall, for example, and yet little tiny quantum particles

08:27.490 --> 08:28.870
are allowed to do that.

08:31.130 --> 08:36.700
Atomic decays display quantum tunneling effects in a particularly striking manner.

08:37.640 --> 08:43.460
In fact, quantum tunneling explains why radioactive elements decay.

08:44.450 --> 08:51.650
An atomic nucleus can be represented as a potential well, where the protons and neutrons are trapped

08:51.800 --> 09:02.450
inside a square potential, a proton or neutron bound inside the atomic nucleus never has an entirely

09:02.450 --> 09:08.230
normal energy because of Heisenberg's position, momentum and certainty.

09:08.810 --> 09:14.970
It has a ground state energy, which in classical mechanics would be perfectly zero.

09:15.140 --> 09:19.760
But in quantum mechanics, it is tiny but non-zero.

09:20.860 --> 09:29.020
Recall how the same applies to the ground state energy of an electron in the hydrogen atom.

09:30.540 --> 09:37.050
It to this reason, there is a tiny but non-zero probability to tunnel, which the particle will acquire

09:37.050 --> 09:47.940
sooner or later, a sufficient impulse to overcome the nuclear barrier and traverse it sooner or later

09:48.150 --> 09:53.880
means that the time at which the signal decay will occur is completely undetermined.

09:54.510 --> 09:59.130
Also, one can speak of a mean lifetime for nuclease.

10:00.880 --> 10:09.310
For special nuclear strike, structural and energetic configurations, this period of time can be almost

10:09.310 --> 10:09.870
infinite.

10:10.600 --> 10:19.570
In that case, the nucleus is considered to be stable and that means for extremely long, eventually

10:19.570 --> 10:21.940
also longer than the life of the universe.

10:22.450 --> 10:28.780
Halftimes also very short, say, of the order of a few microseconds.

10:30.100 --> 10:37.450
An element is considered radioactive when several nuclei decay every second.

10:38.810 --> 10:45.860
But the underlying principle is substantially the same if we apply the Schrodinger equation to the nuclear

10:45.860 --> 10:54.140
potential well and set the appropriate boundary conditions, we obtain a solution for the wavefunction

10:54.440 --> 10:58.990
which will furnish the probability to tunnel outside.

10:59.030 --> 11:08.480
There is a little wave part of the solution, the small way the left and right side of X in the figure

11:08.510 --> 11:18.020
here, which is also non-zero at great distances from the atomic nucleus, and which means that there

11:18.020 --> 11:28.430
is a tiny but non-zero probability given, as usual by the model square of PSI of X to find a proton

11:28.430 --> 11:32.240
or neutron ejected outside the nucleus.

11:33.110 --> 11:38.930
And then we say that a nuclear decay even has taken place here.

11:38.930 --> 11:51.710
Also an example which shows nuclear decay, often uranium isotope into thorium, one with emission of

11:51.710 --> 11:56.450
an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus.

11:59.290 --> 12:05.260
An important point to keep in mind for all these examples is that there is no way to determine.

12:06.160 --> 12:15.400
Or decide apriori which particles will tunnel through and which will not the tunnel effect, like all

12:15.400 --> 12:20.210
quantum effects, is a purely random stochastic effect.

12:21.070 --> 12:27.850
It is a probabilistic and completely unpredictable process which determines which of the single particles

12:27.850 --> 12:29.480
will tunnel through or not.

12:30.460 --> 12:39.490
You can never say when an element decays only the mean amount of time that it takes for half of the

12:39.490 --> 12:41.280
nuclei to decay.

12:41.710 --> 12:49.390
We can tell this fact will be used later to illustrate also the Schrodinger's cat paradox.

12:51.390 --> 12:58.800
Quantum theory is not just something theoretical, most of the physicists working on are with quantum

12:58.800 --> 13:06.660
theory today are mostly concerned with all sorts of possible practical applications rather than questions

13:06.660 --> 13:08.250
about its foundations.

13:09.270 --> 13:15.750
One interesting example, which shows how quantum effects are not only interesting phenomena for physical

13:15.750 --> 13:20.880
or philosophical ruminations, but also can have very practical applications.

13:21.270 --> 13:28.110
Is this so-called scanning tunneling microscope or shortly ASTM?

13:29.520 --> 13:38.040
And ASTM is a microscope that uses quantum tunneling effects to investigate surfaces of materials and

13:38.040 --> 13:41.490
the resolution of the atomic scale.

13:42.660 --> 13:51.750
It was possible to build such such microscopes only after the 1980s because they require particularly

13:51.750 --> 14:00.030
precise mechanics, cryogenic cryogenic techniques and extremely fine positioning methods.

14:01.260 --> 14:06.120
Their working principle, however, is relatively easy to understand.

14:06.120 --> 14:11.540
Once you know the ones, you know how quantum tunneling works.

14:12.840 --> 14:20.250
Very briefly and schematically, this figure shows a tip which is usually made of graphene.

14:21.750 --> 14:30.870
This tip must be extremely thin and sharp, a sort of needle which is only a few atoms thick itself

14:31.410 --> 14:36.970
in order to position it exactly on each individual atom from time to time.

14:37.920 --> 14:46.590
This tape is positioned through another very precise positioning system made of pizza, electric crystals,

14:47.340 --> 14:55.680
the genetic properties of which can be varied and modulated very precisely by applying an electric tension

14:56.250 --> 14:59.510
and which positions it the tip.

15:00.090 --> 15:05.370
This little needle above the surface that is to be analyzed.

15:06.660 --> 15:15.060
This graphene tip is positioned very closely to the atoms of the sample surface onto which also an electric

15:15.060 --> 15:16.210
potential is applied.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.050
So you have this electric potential on both sides.

15:20.400 --> 15:29.610
At some point they get so near that the electrons of one atom of the tip can quantum tunnel through

15:29.820 --> 15:35.400
the potential barrier induced by the tunneling voltage to the atom of the sample.

15:37.720 --> 15:46.570
This really is a tiny but measurable electric current, which can be read out if appropriate, appropriately

15:46.570 --> 15:49.060
amplified through some electronics.

15:50.680 --> 15:59.080
The tape then moves along on the sample surface by means of this pizza electric positioning system and

15:59.380 --> 16:08.320
through a computerized distance and position, control scans the area of interest step by step.

16:09.830 --> 16:18.260
It becomes then possible to reconstruct pixel by pixel an image that represents the atomic landscape.

16:19.770 --> 16:20.340
Thereby.

16:21.480 --> 16:27.420
Can one obtain images like this one, which is a Graffin surface?

16:28.980 --> 16:39.300
In some sense, we might say that the scanner is scanning tunneling microscope, the system allows us

16:39.300 --> 16:42.030
to see, so to speak, atoms.

16:43.080 --> 16:51.330
But you should by now be able to understand that what these images actually show are probabilities,

16:52.170 --> 17:00.720
more precisely the probability that is at the specific position, the microscope type measures and interaction

17:00.930 --> 17:01.890
with the atoms.

17:02.970 --> 17:08.640
And in what sense does this imply seeing, one might ask?

17:10.590 --> 17:18.780
Are these images really showing us an objective reality as things they are really.

17:20.120 --> 17:24.650
It's difficult to give a real answer to this, because, after all.

17:25.590 --> 17:34.440
It is difficult to say if a probability wave or a probability density distribution is something objectively

17:34.440 --> 17:37.200
real, but after all.

17:38.130 --> 17:47.190
This is what we are left with, the universe that we observe is at a quantum level is always and only

17:47.670 --> 17:49.770
a quantum probability distribution.
