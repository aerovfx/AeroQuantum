WEBVTT

00:00.590 --> 00:10.010
The cosine squared spin orientation, probability distribution emerging from the Stangl experiments

00:10.370 --> 00:13.580
did not really come as a surprise to physicists.

00:14.240 --> 00:23.720
Something quite similar was well known much earlier than the advent of quantum physics by observing

00:23.720 --> 00:26.460
the behavior of polarized light.

00:28.070 --> 00:37.390
We already hinted at the property of polarization that an electromagnetic wave can have in case of a

00:37.460 --> 00:40.320
vertically polarized electromagnetic wave.

00:40.610 --> 00:49.280
We said that the vector of the propagating propagating electric field oscillates along a vertical y

00:49.310 --> 00:54.330
axis perpendicular to its direction of propagation.

00:55.910 --> 01:00.950
However, usually light from natural sources is not polarized.

01:01.790 --> 01:08.480
There is no preferred playing along which the electric field of a beam of light is polarized.

01:09.120 --> 01:19.580
It is allowed to oscillate along all possible directions and and polarized source of light emits electromagnetic

01:19.670 --> 01:24.590
electromagnetic waves randomly as shown, for instance, here.

01:25.860 --> 01:36.180
However, it is possible to filter out polarised light from an unauthorized source polarizers our optical

01:36.180 --> 01:44.880
filters that allow only a specific polarization to pass through and absorb or reflect any other, not

01:44.880 --> 01:51.690
be confused with wavelength filters that select specific wavelengths of wavelengths intervals.

01:53.640 --> 02:02.880
They these polarizers could be made of special crystal glass plates, thin films, metallic metallic

02:02.880 --> 02:10.350
wire grids and so forth, which can all perform a polarizing function on light.

02:11.730 --> 02:18.810
Polarizing filters are used in camera lenses and photography, as you probably know, or in sunglasses,

02:18.810 --> 02:24.590
as you probably also know, to avoid an unwanted reflections.

02:24.840 --> 02:31.560
Dark skies suppress glare from the surface of a body of water and so on.

02:32.850 --> 02:42.000
A relatively simple type of polarizer is a wire grid, wire grid polarizer made of many fine parallel

02:42.360 --> 02:51.570
metallic wires on a plane which filters out linearly, linearly polarized electromagnetic wave with

02:51.570 --> 02:57.380
the electric field papen perpendicular to the wires as shown in the figure.

02:59.710 --> 03:09.850
Once polarised light of intensity, let's label it I zero capital letters, the I zero, and once this

03:09.850 --> 03:17.430
is obtained with this filter, this first filter, a second polarizer can be added to them.

03:17.440 --> 03:26.680
The polarized beam, the first polarization of electromagnetic waves of photons is analogous to the

03:26.680 --> 03:34.450
selection performed by the first STEM Galla device on the electrons that we saw in the previous lectures

03:34.870 --> 03:40.160
and it selects which selected it the spin along a specific orientation.

03:40.900 --> 03:48.700
However, here, instead of selecting out the electrons with the spin up, I can state it is the photons

03:48.970 --> 03:56.320
with the specific polarization, not not their spin polarization, which are filtered out along one

03:56.320 --> 03:57.770
preferred direction.

03:58.480 --> 04:06.220
Similarly, the second polarizer acts in a way similar to that which we saw with the second S.G. device

04:06.220 --> 04:07.390
on electrons.

04:08.290 --> 04:15.340
If it is oriented along the same direction of the first polarizer, it simply lets the same photon and

04:15.340 --> 04:22.120
its paralyzation ion state pass through through the polarizer with 100 percent probability.

04:23.740 --> 04:30.250
The question then is whether and how the so let's call it dimming factor.

04:30.610 --> 04:39.130
Uh, dependent on the and the rotation of the second light polarizer for photons is comparable, comparable

04:39.430 --> 04:45.460
to the squared cosine probability law we discussed earlier for the electron spin.

04:47.410 --> 04:56.650
Again, the answer cannot be derived from logical reasoning, but must come from empirical data by measuring

04:56.650 --> 05:06.130
how the intensity of the outcome of the outcoming beam depends on the relative orientation by an angle

05:06.490 --> 05:10.030
Twitter or data of the two polarizers.

05:10.660 --> 05:13.780
One obtains the following the following graph.

05:17.110 --> 05:25.630
Also this time, as you can see, the intensity varies according to a squared cosine law.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.850
But and this is of paramount importance to keep in mind with a teacher with an angle.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.610
Peter instead of Peter have.

05:40.640 --> 05:50.450
It has to have dependence, for instance, it takes 90 degrees rotation to stop the electromagnetic

05:50.450 --> 05:59.450
beam instead of the 180 necessary that we saw for the electrons, compare this graph with the one we

05:59.450 --> 06:05.530
obtained for FermÃ­n particles, and I will depict it also in the next slide.

06:06.710 --> 06:14.090
And this graph summarizes the so-called law.

06:15.080 --> 06:23.480
It is the intensity in the independence of data is equal I zero the entrance intensity, the initial

06:23.720 --> 06:26.840
intensity times this squared.

06:27.910 --> 06:28.750
Kozin.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.450
Off Teater not to have.

06:34.550 --> 06:42.200
It can be seen as a natural consequence of the fact that the polarizer simply selects out only the vertical

06:42.200 --> 06:50.100
component of the electric electric field vector tilted by 32 degrees relative to the vertical axis.

06:51.020 --> 06:59.540
In fact, by simple trigonometric considerations, the cosine of the original wave amplitude remains

06:59.540 --> 07:05.930
and the and to obtain the intensity, one has only to square it.

07:07.140 --> 07:07.680
So.

07:08.660 --> 07:16.060
At first, there is nothing particularly strange or quantum in this phenomenon.

07:17.140 --> 07:21.570
It is two centuries old knowledge that light can be polarized.

07:21.790 --> 07:30.330
The French physicist Etienne Louis Mallows discovered this law in 18 or nine.

07:31.600 --> 07:38.920
But considering what has been discovered in the time since, especially comparing photons with the fermions

07:38.920 --> 07:43.630
behavior, we can recognize interesting facts about both.

07:44.830 --> 07:55.660
Let us translate what we have acquired so far into a corpuscular picture in point like particle picture,

07:55.660 --> 07:56.470
so to speak.

07:57.990 --> 08:07.650
Since the probability of a photon going through a polarizer is nothing else than the proper proportionality

08:07.650 --> 08:19.200
factor of the number of transmitted photons eye versus the incident, photons eye zero, that is B equals

08:19.380 --> 08:20.910
I over eight zero.

08:21.690 --> 08:30.320
Then Miloslav amounts also to saying that the probability of a single photon passing through the polarizer,

08:30.330 --> 08:36.420
the second polarizer is simply the cosine squared lower piece of data.

08:36.510 --> 08:39.960
Theta equals cosine square squared detA.

08:41.660 --> 08:49.400
Nowadays, this can be checked directly, it is possible to dim the light source to such a degree that

08:49.400 --> 08:53.330
only one photon at a time goes through the polarizers.

08:53.780 --> 09:01.760
Recall how we have already seen this for the double slit experiment, and one can count the single photon

09:02.540 --> 09:14.330
with a clicking detector detector that simply clicks for each single photon on the other side at and

09:15.020 --> 09:18.280
count this one at a time.

09:19.310 --> 09:25.520
By doing so, one discovers that in fact, the probability which the detector clicks follows a cosine

09:25.520 --> 09:26.140
squared law.

09:26.780 --> 09:33.410
With this we re-establish the the the wave particle duality again.

09:34.160 --> 09:43.220
One can take the classical point of view of the classical physicists like Marlos did, who assumed assumed

09:43.220 --> 09:44.570
light to be a wave.

09:45.230 --> 09:52.010
The polarizer in this case does not block the wave entirely entirely, except, of course, for 90 degrees

09:52.010 --> 09:54.620
orientation, but simply dampens it.

09:55.550 --> 10:05.150
Whereas from the corpuscular perspective, from the particle point like perspective, there is no dimming,

10:05.150 --> 10:12.470
only a cutting the number of photons allowed to get through the polarizer without reducing the single

10:12.590 --> 10:13.690
photons energy.

10:13.700 --> 10:16.190
However, the single photons energy.

10:17.360 --> 10:27.350
Is always the same, remains the same, by rotating the polarizer and dimming the flux of photons,

10:27.680 --> 10:34.370
I only reduce the number of photons, not their energy, the photons.

10:37.070 --> 10:45.020
The single the single photon passes or does not pass, that is is absorbed or eventually reflected when

10:45.020 --> 10:54.170
it does not pass, but you will never register half a photon, for example, also for eighty nine point

10:54.170 --> 10:55.320
nine degrees.

10:55.350 --> 10:59.990
That is almost by complete dimming the flux of photons.

10:59.990 --> 11:07.760
There are on average, still three photons out of a million, which will pass the polarizer.

11:08.480 --> 11:18.200
But once there will have managed to go through, these will be exactly like the incoming photons along

11:18.230 --> 11:19.670
our journey.

11:19.670 --> 11:28.160
We will later discover how the marlos law will lead to one of the most unexpected consequences for our

11:28.280 --> 11:29.010
world view.

11:29.480 --> 11:36.760
It is the death sentence for any local and realistic hidden variable theory.

11:37.730 --> 11:42.530
But until the 1960s, this was something far from obvious.

11:42.890 --> 11:48.740
Other principles, facts and foundational issues had to be clarified first.

11:50.630 --> 11:58.620
An important question and at this point is why do we measure for photons and Teater instead of a two

11:58.640 --> 12:04.160
1/2 squared cosine dependence, as we saw for electrons?

12:06.260 --> 12:15.560
Recall that for the intrinsic momentum of an electron and that of all odd half integrase spin particles,

12:15.560 --> 12:24.950
the so-called fermions named after the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, one gets through any measurement

12:24.950 --> 12:32.180
of the spin component that is the eigenvalue associated to the eigenvector state.

12:32.510 --> 12:45.950
Always spin of the electron here as capital letters E minus equals plus minus H half, which is plus

12:45.950 --> 13:00.530
minus H over for PI where this little four pi is nothing other than the than a 720 angle in radians.

13:01.160 --> 13:09.860
Planck's constant H is a natural constant and is derived experimentally as you know with the photoelectric

13:09.860 --> 13:19.120
effect and the spin s e c minus is also not something that can be derived but must be measured experimentally.

13:19.130 --> 13:28.820
For example, as we know with a S.G. device, the fact that just H and as have an inverse for PI proportionality,

13:29.270 --> 13:38.780
which is related to the 720 rotation reflect reflected in the squared cosine of T Tav instead of TITRE

13:39.530 --> 13:46.020
is not a mere convention, but reflects some deep principle that is imposed by nature.

13:47.600 --> 13:56.540
Therefore, since four photons which are part of a class of the so-called bosun's named after the Indian

13:56.540 --> 14:02.210
physicists, General Boser, we have the same cosine squared intensity.

14:02.420 --> 14:14.390
But for a Teater dependent's that is normal 360 degrees full rotation, it is a plausible assumption

14:14.600 --> 14:21.080
that the photons intrinsic angular momentum amounts to plus minus H bar.

14:21.810 --> 14:27.680
It is as gamma equals plus minus H bar, which is equal H.

14:27.890 --> 14:40.430
Planck's constant divided to PI instead of four pi or in other words, photons do us the favor of living

14:40.430 --> 14:42.230
in a less weird world.

14:42.770 --> 14:47.300
They perceive rotation's as we humans do.

14:49.140 --> 14:56.580
More generally, one can state that the spin value of a particle reflects the kind of rotational real

14:56.670 --> 15:05.550
it lives in, we can extend this reasoning by predicting that spin to spin three etc particles need

15:05.550 --> 15:16.440
only 180 degrees, 120 degrees and so on rotations to bring them back into the same quantum state while

15:16.890 --> 15:26.130
spin three have spin five, five, etc particles will they will need less rotation, not more, namely

15:26.520 --> 15:30.210
240 degrees and at 44 degrees and so on.

15:30.420 --> 15:38.750
Rotations to look again the same as in the initial state before the rotation.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.710
Finally spin zero particles never change for any angle.

15:43.890 --> 15:45.990
One chooses to look up them.

15:47.150 --> 15:48.950
They look always the same.

15:50.620 --> 15:59.050
Independently from the direction upon which we look on them, since they have no momentum.

16:00.370 --> 16:02.680
Veterans are in the first place.

16:04.860 --> 16:13.500
However, nature seems to restrain itself, since all non particles are Aspinwall have plus minus half

16:13.680 --> 16:24.350
of particles, that is fermions, the so-called leptons and quarks or spin one particles, most bosons,

16:24.360 --> 16:32.400
for instance, the photon, and with only one spined zero particle, the famous Higgs boson, that kind

16:32.400 --> 16:39.510
of particle one uses to say that it gives mass to the balls to make it become material and make it make

16:39.510 --> 16:48.360
part of the so-called so-called standard model of particle physics physics that then there is also the

16:48.360 --> 16:57.420
graviton that is the particle supposed to mediate the gravitational force and is predicted to have spin

16:57.420 --> 17:06.750
to while other speculative speculative prizes, theoretical particle speculative particles like those

17:06.750 --> 17:15.120
predicted by so-called supersymmetry theories are believed to possess other spin values eventually as

17:15.120 --> 17:15.450
well.

17:15.780 --> 17:23.730
But these have not been detected so far, despite intense research and might be possibly not exist.

17:23.730 --> 17:31.710
And all the theory supersymmetry, super gravity, super string theory might be probably a wrong theory.

17:32.790 --> 17:41.940
The world we perceive with our human senses is therefore dominated almost exclusively by spin one and

17:42.660 --> 17:44.930
one half and spin two particles.

17:45.900 --> 17:49.280
Also the Higgs boson if you wish.

17:49.290 --> 17:58.650
But this has lifetimes of the order of 10 to the power of minus 22 seconds.

17:58.650 --> 18:02.940
That is billions of billions and thousands of billions of billions of seconds.

18:03.300 --> 18:06.300
And it is way beyond human perception.

18:09.180 --> 18:14.770
But how must we intend the photons spin so far?

18:14.790 --> 18:18.330
We discussed only about paralyzation.

18:19.310 --> 18:25.550
The polarization of the photon, which, however, is not to be confused with the spin, another main

18:25.550 --> 18:32.810
difference between the spin of massive particles and that of massless particles such as light particles,

18:32.990 --> 18:41.720
the photon is that the letter has not only two possible spin states, but also only two possible spin

18:41.720 --> 18:51.260
orientations, namely that along the direction of propagation or opposite to it, one says that a photon

18:51.380 --> 18:53.480
has Felicity.

18:54.420 --> 19:02.640
Hilly city, which tells us whether the spin is aligned or anti aligned with the momentum that is its

19:02.640 --> 19:03.800
speed direction.

19:05.000 --> 19:11.840
It cannot have a spinning axis directed, say, at 90 degrees perpendicular perpendicular to the direction

19:11.840 --> 19:12.350
of motion.

19:14.150 --> 19:18.230
This is another difference between classical mechanics and quantum physics.

19:18.920 --> 19:25.070
In classical physics, an object must not necessarily rotate around the direction of its most motion

19:25.070 --> 19:25.730
in space.

19:26.090 --> 19:28.730
I think, for example, of the Earth.

19:29.210 --> 19:37.190
It has a north South Pole not at all directed along the orbital path.

19:38.840 --> 19:47.480
In general, a particle is said to be right handed, that is, have positive Telecity if the spin and

19:47.480 --> 19:49.250
momentum are parallel.

19:50.120 --> 19:57.890
While it is said to be left handed that have that that that means they have negative publicity if the

19:57.890 --> 20:00.710
spin and momentum are anti parallel.

20:02.020 --> 20:11.050
So each individual photon will have its spin either along the direction of motion or against it, other

20:11.050 --> 20:13.360
spin, their actions are not allowed.

20:15.790 --> 20:23.650
The conceptual connection between waves and photons with their positive or negative publicity is realized

20:23.650 --> 20:31.670
by the electric field rotation of circular, so-called circular, polarized electromagnetic waves.

20:32.200 --> 20:40.660
So instead of being vertically paralyzed or not paralyzed at all, we are speaking now of circular polarization.

20:41.590 --> 20:50.170
Circular polarization means that the direction of the electric field vector rotates with time at a steady

20:50.170 --> 20:52.120
rate in a plain.

20:53.290 --> 20:56.740
Perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation.

20:58.180 --> 21:08.020
For right circular polarization, the electric field vector rotates in a right handed SiSense with respect

21:08.020 --> 21:09.700
to the direction of propagation.

21:11.440 --> 21:21.610
Just use your right hand with the thumb pointing towards the direction of propagation of the propagation

21:21.610 --> 21:29.140
of the wave and the fingers wrapping the anticlockwise movement of the black arrow, the electric vector

21:29.140 --> 21:39.190
field, and you will get the right circular polarization of the electromagnetic field while for the

21:39.190 --> 21:45.730
left circular polarization, the electric field vector rotates in left hand side, which means that

21:45.730 --> 21:51.760
you have to use your left hand and doing the same thing, as I just mentioned.

21:53.930 --> 22:03.380
The photons of counter clockwise, right, polarised light, Kerry, and angular momentum of as gamma

22:04.040 --> 22:09.350
equals plus H bar along the direction of flight.

22:10.970 --> 22:18.160
When light is clockwise, less polarized, the photons instead carry an angular momentum of as gamma

22:18.200 --> 22:23.300
equals minus H bar along the flight direction.

22:26.140 --> 22:34.180
Finally, note how in the case of linearly polarised light, photons can be considered to be in a state

22:34.180 --> 22:40.460
of superposition of the right and left, circular polarization geometrically.

22:40.490 --> 22:42.070
This sounds almost obvious.

22:42.580 --> 22:49.930
Adding together two vectors, spinning with the same angular frequency, but in the opposite directions

22:50.560 --> 22:56.190
will give as a result a still standing vector.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.050
It does move, but is.

23:00.410 --> 23:03.470
It indicates a linear polarization.

23:04.560 --> 23:13.290
What this precisely means and implies from a quantum perspective will be clarified next, where we will

23:13.500 --> 23:20.070
expressly discuss the principle of quantum superposition position and which will turn out to be one

23:20.070 --> 23:24.870
of the most fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.
