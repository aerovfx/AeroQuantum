00:00.800 --> 00:08.270
Apart from the position momentum, Heisenberg uncertainty relation, there exists also a time, energy,

00:08.420 --> 00:16.940
uncertainty, relation with Heisenberg's uncertainty relation that the time that a B greater or equal

00:17.270 --> 00:24.800
bar have there is likewise a so-called time energy relation, which.

00:26.000 --> 00:38.330
Reads Delta Times, Delta, the greater equal age half with T. Delta T. being the time interval it takes

00:38.330 --> 00:44.750
to perform a measurement or the time interval a physical phenomenon takes to occur.

00:44.960 --> 00:55.130
For example, an atomic energy transition and Delta being the uncertainty over the energy of the measured

00:55.130 --> 00:55.670
system.

00:56.770 --> 01:04.450
The time energy uncertainty relation tells us something about the shortest, average time Delta T. We

01:04.450 --> 01:14.500
need in order to notice a change in energy of a quantum system by an amount equal to its standard deviation.

01:14.680 --> 01:24.820
Delta or stated more simply, the faster a measurement is performed, the greater the uncertainty on

01:24.820 --> 01:26.200
the energy readout.

01:27.360 --> 01:34.110
This time, energy uncertainty should not come as a surprise, since there is always an uncertainty

01:34.110 --> 01:35.820
over the momentum of a particle.

01:36.480 --> 01:44.580
This also implies an uncertainty over its energy because its momentum and kinetic energy are too directly

01:44.580 --> 01:46.460
related to physical quantities.

01:47.220 --> 01:55.200
And since space, time and energy are the three most important ingredients with which the physical universe

01:55.200 --> 01:56.040
is made of.

01:56.910 --> 02:03.540
It is clear that these two simple little inequality's are expressing something very fundamental about

02:03.540 --> 02:05.300
our physical existence.

02:06.450 --> 02:14.040
Just as in the case of Heisenberg's uncertainty, the time energy uncertainty arises from the wave properties

02:14.040 --> 02:18.270
inherent in the quantum mechanical description of nature as well.

02:19.710 --> 02:20.940
In modern textbooks.

02:21.150 --> 02:27.780
On quantum mechanics, this uncertainty relation, as well as Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, are

02:27.780 --> 02:33.230
usually both derived from operator algebra and statistical considerations.

02:34.310 --> 02:41.550
We do not give these rigorous mathematical proofs here, but let us attempt an intuitive approach that

02:41.550 --> 02:45.320
can illustrate where this relation comes from.

02:47.720 --> 02:55.700
Let us limit ourselves to the case of a photon, a photon of energy, we know from what we discussed

02:55.700 --> 03:04.430
for the Braly hypothesis in the breath diffraction lecture that the photon carries a momentum P equals

03:04.460 --> 03:05.510
E over C.

03:07.270 --> 03:13.700
It's uncertainty over the momentum Delta P due to the uncertainty over the energy.

03:13.790 --> 03:22.540
Delta can therefore be written straightforwardly as Delta P equals Delta over C.

03:24.690 --> 03:35.040
The time that light needs to travel through the space Intervale, Delta X is Delta T equals Delta X

03:35.040 --> 03:35.760
or the C.

03:37.470 --> 03:46.680
From that follows directly that Delta X equals Delta three times C, C, the speed of light, which

03:46.680 --> 03:51.180
in Baku is 300000 kilometers per second per second.

03:53.120 --> 04:01.880
Putting this together, that is making the product of Delta X Times, Delta P one gets Delta three times

04:01.880 --> 04:02.540
Delta T..

04:04.090 --> 04:13.100
But this must be greater or equal age by a half because of Heisenberg's uncertainty relation.

04:13.750 --> 04:21.820
And from which final one gets the time energy revelation, Delta Delta, eight times the 30 greater

04:21.820 --> 04:23.560
equal number of.

04:25.600 --> 04:32.920
To illustrate a bit the physical meaning of the time energy relation, think of a photon, the quantum

04:32.920 --> 04:43.450
uncertainty of a photons energy during a time span, Delta T is Delta greater equal H bar over two times

04:43.450 --> 04:44.380
Delta T..

04:46.360 --> 04:56.050
Or equivalently, we must wait a time Delta T, which must be greater H bar over to Delta to notice

04:56.050 --> 05:00.980
a change of the photons energy by by an amount.

05:01.000 --> 05:01.720
Delta E.

05:03.610 --> 05:11.260
In words, that means that the uncertainty over the energy of a quantum state is inversely proportional

05:11.260 --> 05:19.300
to the time scale during which it occurs or during which we observe it, the shorter measurement is

05:19.960 --> 05:27.430
or the shorter the time during which a quantum event, of course, the larger becomes the possible deviation

05:27.430 --> 05:37.060
from an average energy value we will measure and the more uncertain and fuzzy the energy of the events

05:37.060 --> 05:38.950
we will observe becomes.

05:40.310 --> 05:48.860
So if we desire to obtain an infinitely precise measurement of the energy of, say, a particle, we

05:48.860 --> 05:53.900
would have to wait an infinitely long time to obtain the result of the measurement.

05:55.360 --> 06:04.120
And it can't be emphasized enough that this is not due to an inaccuracy of our measurements, but rather

06:04.540 --> 06:11.440
it is an intrinsic property of nature from the practical point of view, even in principle and with

06:11.440 --> 06:18.310
the most ideal and infinitely precise measurement device, we will always be bounded by this natural

06:18.310 --> 06:23.200
and intrinsic uncertainty of the single outcome at every measurement.

06:24.580 --> 06:32.230
Or to see it from another perspective, one needs much more time to prepare a system in a sharp, sharply

06:32.230 --> 06:36.910
defined energy state than one with less determined one.

06:38.640 --> 06:45.930
However, for the single photon, that does not mean that one never will measure its energy with less

06:45.930 --> 06:46.690
uncertainty.

06:47.670 --> 06:56.160
It is all about a statistical fluke fluctuation, an average uncertainty one should expect independent

06:56.160 --> 07:00.000
of the perfection and precision level of the measurement apparatus.

07:01.390 --> 07:07.430
To clarify this important conceptual aspect, let us take a step further and be more precise.

07:08.350 --> 07:13.870
First of all, the same Delta refers to the statistical standard deviation.

07:14.560 --> 07:20.920
We already saw how this is the statistical fluctuation of a set of measured values around some average

07:20.920 --> 07:27.730
value, with the latter being the expectation value we discussed in the lecture on the state vector

07:27.730 --> 07:30.010
observables and the Schrodinger equation.

07:31.120 --> 07:40.060
In the case of interest here, it tells us how large that the energy standard deviation Delta is as

07:40.060 --> 07:43.120
a departure from an average energy.

07:44.110 --> 07:52.540
E ba obtained ideally after an infinite number of measurements, once you have measured a sufficient

07:52.540 --> 07:58.060
number of Even's, you should obtain the typical bell shaped exponential probability probability density

07:58.060 --> 08:06.010
function that is the so-called normal distribution or Gaussian probability density function, which

08:06.010 --> 08:12.880
tells us how the energy fluctuations around a mean energy are distributed.

08:14.270 --> 08:21.770
Here we have on the accessor the energy and on the ordinate axis, the number of obtained measurements

08:21.770 --> 08:30.920
corresponding to some energy e I with some ends and measured.

08:31.850 --> 08:40.280
Energy value, as a rule of thumb, the probability to find an energy measurement inside the standard

08:40.280 --> 08:53.480
deviation delta around a mean value bar is about 68 percent as shown with a blind area under the Gaussian

08:53.660 --> 08:54.260
function.

08:55.490 --> 09:02.780
This means that we can observe even with more uncertainty than Delta, but with less probability.

09:04.090 --> 09:12.220
Now, the similarity between Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the time energy uncertainty should

09:12.220 --> 09:13.990
not mislead us.

09:15.020 --> 09:22.610
Because as we have seen in quantum mechanics, operators can represent the position and momentum as

09:22.610 --> 09:30.350
their complementarity can be expressed by noncommitted commuting operators, we have seen that the energy

09:30.350 --> 09:37.010
of a system can also be represented by an observable an operator which acts on the wave function and

09:37.430 --> 09:44.150
which expresses the Schrodinger equation that is namely the the Hamiltonian operator.

09:45.320 --> 09:53.210
However, there is no time operator in quantum mechanics and therefore there is also no commuting relation

09:53.210 --> 09:54.470
between time and energy.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.020
In quantum mechanics.

09:57.800 --> 10:03.490
Time appears only as a parameter in the equations, just a number.

10:04.520 --> 10:09.990
It turns out that the time is not an observable because it is not something we can measure.

10:11.510 --> 10:14.180
This might sound strange at first.

10:14.960 --> 10:21.350
After all, in our vernacular, we speak of clocks as measuring time.

10:22.400 --> 10:29.000
But if you think about it, you realize that clocks measure a change in a physical system and indicate

10:29.000 --> 10:32.180
it by an arrow or digital display.

10:33.160 --> 10:41.590
Time is something too subjective and indefinable, an entity for anyone to ever really measure in the

10:41.590 --> 10:46.600
sense that you can measure the position of a particle or the length of a table.

10:47.860 --> 10:57.400
This is because time is not something inherently possessed by an object, as are its length mass position,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.370
energy or charge, electric charge.

11:00.040 --> 11:10.360
It is something we use our posteriorly as a measure of change of these inherent properties, but it

11:10.360 --> 11:13.710
is not a property of objects themselves.

11:15.190 --> 11:18.150
The quantum world reminds us of this.

11:19.060 --> 11:23.800
There is no such such thing as time as a time operator.

11:24.250 --> 11:28.660
There is no time out there that you can see and touch light.

11:28.660 --> 11:30.390
You can see and touch a table.

11:31.060 --> 11:35.780
Time is just a parameter in our physical series.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.550
Just a number that is a scholar quantity.

11:41.400 --> 11:49.830
One can compare this with the space time notion of relativity here, time and space are on equal footing.

11:50.940 --> 11:59.730
Physicists even use time as a fourth dimension, together with the three spatial dimensions where whereas

12:00.000 --> 12:05.860
in quantum mechanics, time appears as very different, separate entity from space.

12:06.570 --> 12:14.070
So there is something mysterious in this discrepancy that is debated even nowadays among philosophers

12:14.070 --> 12:14.930
and physicists.

12:15.390 --> 12:22.170
It is also one of the stumbling blocks for modern physicists who are trying to unify quantum theory

12:22.170 --> 12:28.270
with general relativity into a unique, uh, unified field theory.

12:29.460 --> 12:37.560
One reason for why this turns out to be so difficult is that no one knows how to build a theory that

12:37.560 --> 12:47.070
brings under the same umbrella such diverse conceptions and expressions of space and time and time as

12:47.070 --> 12:50.490
we find it in general relativity and quantum mechanics.

12:52.950 --> 13:02.370
So let us consider an example whether quantum time energy uncertainty plays an important role, an instance

13:02.370 --> 13:09.180
where this, of course, is that of the atomic energy transitions, we can take as an example that of

13:09.190 --> 13:13.830
the the hydrogen atom photon emission here.

13:13.830 --> 13:25.470
The transition, of course, very quickly over time of Delta to smaller than the tenth power of a second,

13:25.470 --> 13:27.730
less than a tenth of a billionth of a second.

13:29.010 --> 13:36.240
This means that according to the time, energy and certain relation, every time an atom emits photon,

13:36.810 --> 13:41.490
it will not always possess the same energy as the previous one.

13:43.350 --> 13:51.210
Even if for each single individual photon, one measure is a definite energy, the subsequent measurement

13:51.210 --> 13:59.790
of several other photons will give a slightly different, different energy for each with a random distribution

13:59.910 --> 14:12.450
center centered on the mean that is with Eber plus minus Delta Ibar being the average atonce energy

14:12.480 --> 14:15.060
and Delta its standard deviation.

14:16.010 --> 14:25.120
And Delta itself, given by Delta Greater Equal Age Bar over two times Delta T.

14:26.970 --> 14:33.810
You might even detect photons with an even greater energy deviations than Delta, but the probability

14:33.810 --> 14:37.070
that this will occur decreases quickly.

14:37.410 --> 14:43.230
That is exponentially according to a normal distribution caution law.

14:45.300 --> 14:53.400
This implies that the lines of atomic spectra are always a bit of an energy and interval in conventional

14:53.400 --> 14:59.910
spectrographs, the lines are just the projection on a screen of Haslet through which the light source

15:00.480 --> 15:01.420
shines through.

15:01.860 --> 15:10.050
For instance, see the hydrogen and mercury spectral emission lines we showed in the black body radiation

15:10.050 --> 15:10.540
lecture.

15:11.580 --> 15:16.010
There will be two causes of the line thickness.

15:16.740 --> 15:24.150
The first cause you should already know it is the refraction effects of the slits or equivalently due

15:24.150 --> 15:25.880
to the Heisenberg's uncertainty.

15:26.580 --> 15:32.610
The second cause which adds up to the previous one is the atomic level energy uncertainty.

15:33.870 --> 15:41.250
I leave it to you as a homework to show that for a pure light, pure yellow light source, say, coming

15:41.250 --> 15:50.730
from a laser of every average wavelength of 600 nanometers, nanometer is equal ten to the power minus

15:50.730 --> 16:00.750
nine meter a billionth of a meter, with Delta to equal ten to the minus 10 seconds transition time.

16:01.260 --> 16:09.510
The time energy relation leads to an uncertainty of about ten to the minus three nanometers.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.760
That is, as thousands of a nanometer.

16:12.660 --> 16:20.520
This is also a tiny departure from the mean wavelength of the source and is negligible for most applications.

16:21.120 --> 16:25.650
But in some applications it which require high precision.

16:25.830 --> 16:28.680
This effect must be taken into account.

16:30.270 --> 16:37.380
To sum up, time and energy are intimately related in quantum mechanics in such a way that it makes

16:37.380 --> 16:44.790
no sense to speak about precise and definite energy values, everything depends on the timescale we

16:44.790 --> 16:45.560
are considering.

16:46.410 --> 16:53.730
If a quantum event occurs on very short timescales, for example, nuclear and nuclear decays occur

16:53.730 --> 16:58.540
at the order of ten to the power minus 25 seconds.

16:59.490 --> 17:09.180
So extremely short and then its energy will inevitably be undetermined, fuzzy and smeared out over

17:09.180 --> 17:11.340
an interval of energy values.

17:12.140 --> 17:20.040
Again, we see that it makes no sense to speak about objects as having an objective, definite, precise

17:20.040 --> 17:29.460
physical quantity of property such as here the energy at a specific instant of time, no more, no less

17:29.460 --> 17:37.380
than it makes sense in quantum mechanics to speak of things behaving or possessing both a precise position

17:37.380 --> 17:38.250
and momentum.

17:39.510 --> 17:44.750
Objectivity has become here a very questionable thing.

17:45.930 --> 17:54.180
The question that should arise naturally at this point is where do these fluctuations, so to speak,

17:54.180 --> 17:54.810
come from?

17:56.190 --> 18:02.490
And even are there really things in the quantum world as fluctuations?

18:02.610 --> 18:05.230
Are they really fluctuating out there?

18:06.510 --> 18:17.280
Where does that extra or missing energy content delta come into play or go to if the universal law of

18:17.280 --> 18:20.640
energy conservation is supposed to hold?

18:22.200 --> 18:28.660
Is is it energy that pops into existence from out of nothing?

18:30.300 --> 18:38.160
We will try to answer these questions in the coming section on zero point vacuum energy, but virtual

18:38.160 --> 18:42.540
particles and the Casimir effect before that.

18:42.540 --> 18:48.990
However, let us take a look at another strange effect related to the time, energy, uncertainty,

18:49.650 --> 18:51.990
namely the tunnel effect.
