00:00.180 --> 00:09.390
Let us briefly address a topic which you might have heard about frequently, that of a supposed possibility

00:09.390 --> 00:17.610
of taking advantage of quantum entanglement or whatever other quantum effects to transmit at speeds

00:17.610 --> 00:27.300
faster than light or eventually also instantly throughout the universe via wavefunction collapse of

00:27.300 --> 00:29.100
a. correlated particles.

00:30.520 --> 00:36.850
This is something to which many like to resort in order to explain possible telepathic or paranormal

00:36.850 --> 00:47.350
phenomena, to see how this unfortunately is not the case, not even in principle, let us connect again

00:47.350 --> 00:55.930
to the modern experimental set up of the kind we used for the EPR paradox and then further follow the

00:55.930 --> 00:59.260
considerations and consequences to which it leads.

01:00.220 --> 01:07.270
In its spin version, with Alice and Bob making measurements on the spin of the two entangled particles

01:07.270 --> 01:15.460
flying apart, we saw that once the spin of one of the two particles is measured, the spin of the other

01:15.460 --> 01:18.370
particle will immediately be determined.

01:19.690 --> 01:25.360
We also saw why in quantum mechanics, at least in its standard formulation, that is considered a complete

01:25.360 --> 01:25.870
theory.

01:25.870 --> 01:31.860
And without hidden variables, we are not allowed to think that this correlation is predetermined.

01:32.140 --> 01:40.240
That is, it does not arise among the particles at the instant of creation in the source, but must

01:40.240 --> 01:46.960
be considered and understood as being determined at the time of measurement, not before.

01:48.100 --> 01:56.470
We cannot use counterfactual reasoning whereby we imagine them as being one particle in a spin up state

01:56.470 --> 02:00.010
and the other particle in a spin down state during flight.

02:00.670 --> 02:08.890
While we are not looking at it, we must consider the two particles as one and the unique whole in a

02:08.890 --> 02:17.350
superposition state of the two possibilities, and that only when the measurement takes place will one

02:17.350 --> 02:25.330
particle assume the spin up and the other the spin down state just by pure 50 percent chance.

02:26.350 --> 02:34.390
Therefore, while the overall momentum in its singlet state is zero, the the a. correlation of the

02:34.390 --> 02:43.420
two particles comes into existence at the time of measurement here, a very appealing idea naturally

02:43.600 --> 02:44.650
comes to mind.

02:45.400 --> 02:53.800
We might use this super luminal action at a distance to send messages throughout the entire universe

02:53.800 --> 02:59.280
at speeds faster than light, maybe even at infinite speed everywhere.

03:00.040 --> 03:08.320
Contrary to all that relativity has told us so far, that could eventually also be a great method of

03:08.320 --> 03:12.940
communicating with extraterrestrial civilizations, couldn't it?

03:14.440 --> 03:22.780
So the question really is, could Bob and Ellis use this method to instantly transmit messages to each

03:22.780 --> 03:25.540
other through out the universe?

03:27.520 --> 03:35.080
Moreover, the two spin states of elementary particles lend themselves quite well to serving as a binary

03:35.110 --> 03:38.330
encoding system like that in computers.

03:39.970 --> 03:47.610
Nature did us the favor of allowing for particles having having only discrete to value spin states.

03:48.130 --> 03:56.590
For example, one might imagine digital data in the form of ones and zeros associating to spin up the

03:56.590 --> 04:00.130
one digit and to the spin down the zero signable.

04:01.990 --> 04:09.880
So could we in principle use this binary spin encoding to transmit instantly, say, with Alice on Earth

04:09.880 --> 04:18.640
and Bob on the planet around a star in the Andromeda Andromeda galaxy and which is about two million

04:18.640 --> 04:19.680
light years away?

04:21.600 --> 04:28.530
According to quantum mechanics, at least as we know it, in its present formulation, the clear answer

04:28.530 --> 04:31.970
is no, not even in principle.

04:32.160 --> 04:33.310
We cannot do this.

04:35.070 --> 04:43.800
The point we must always be in mind is that neither Ellis nor Bob will ever be able to predict or force

04:44.190 --> 04:48.360
the outcome of the measurement they make on the particles.

04:49.780 --> 04:57.760
They are not allowed to intervene in the random Kwanten process, which entangle the particles at the

04:57.760 --> 05:05.170
source, and they cannot predict or influence the measurement outcome when they receive and measure

05:05.320 --> 05:09.080
their particles in their respective laboratories.

05:10.360 --> 05:20.440
They are simply passive observers of a stream of random digits and have no means of projecting their

05:20.440 --> 05:24.010
particles into a desired set of igan states.

05:25.150 --> 05:32.810
Who decides where the spin up or spin down will appear is neither Alice nor Bob's business.

05:32.830 --> 05:41.890
It is the exclusive competence of nature upon which we have no authority, in fact, to transmit any

05:41.890 --> 05:51.160
sort of information would require, say, Alice, forcing with some non-random regularity the spin outcomes

05:51.430 --> 05:55.170
onto her entangled particle in her laboratory.

05:56.050 --> 06:00.430
Otherwise, she cannot encode any message in a binary code.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.540
Yet this is forbidden.

06:04.040 --> 06:12.440
She has no means by which to intervene and decide in which I can state her particle will be projected

06:12.440 --> 06:14.980
into at the time of her measurement.

06:15.680 --> 06:22.220
She can only make measurements and find out which spin states show up for each particle.

06:23.240 --> 06:31.030
But she cannot predetermine the spins of the particles that she detects in her laboratory.

06:32.630 --> 06:41.330
What they both see, Alice and Bob, is a random stream of even's produced by the radioactive or whatever

06:41.330 --> 06:43.190
kind of entangling source.

06:43.850 --> 06:50.070
But they will never, ever be able to predetermine the next particles state.

06:51.200 --> 06:57.960
This prevents from the outset any possibility of encoding data according to quantum mechanics.

06:57.980 --> 07:04.490
There is always a 50 percent chance of obtaining the up or down spin, and there is nothing you can

07:04.490 --> 07:10.150
do about it other than passively listening to white noise.

07:10.910 --> 07:19.310
And therefore, if they can't determine which spin value comes into being at the instant of measurement,

07:20.180 --> 07:25.150
then they have also no means by which to transmit information.

07:27.050 --> 07:34.700
Therefore, even if there is indeed a correlation between two particles coming into being instantly

07:35.630 --> 07:43.930
also over long distances, it will nevertheless be impossible to use this method to send information.

07:45.230 --> 07:52.810
For this reason, there isn't any real violation of the causal process in the relativistic sense.

07:53.750 --> 07:58.880
It is an nonlocal causality, but in line with relativity.

07:59.180 --> 08:05.870
If we restrict our understanding of relativistic causality to something which is about only slower than

08:05.870 --> 08:08.780
light speed, information transmission.

08:09.740 --> 08:17.510
At any rate, the quantum faster than light correlation must not be seen as a transmission of particles

08:17.510 --> 08:27.020
or a force or a feed that spreads out from Earth to the Andromeda galaxy instantly, all the known particles,

08:27.020 --> 08:35.690
forces and fees that physics deals with are known to always propagate with speeds equal or less than

08:35.690 --> 08:39.130
the speed of light in accordance with relativity.

08:40.160 --> 08:46.190
It is the wave function that collapses instantly and determines a. correlation.

08:47.510 --> 08:53.700
Yet the wave function is not an electromagnetic field or a wave made of particles or force.

08:54.440 --> 08:55.340
So what is it?

08:56.360 --> 08:58.640
Well, nobody knows for sure.

08:59.090 --> 09:01.210
It is just a probability wave.

09:01.730 --> 09:03.380
We can't say more than that.

09:03.380 --> 09:10.850
And therefore we should not extrapolate to particles of fields travelling faster than light.

09:13.020 --> 09:19.770
Moreover, recall how in this experimental setup, which is the analog of the EPR experiment extended

09:19.770 --> 09:27.270
to particles spins, both Alice and Bob have to ask each other about the measurement results if they

09:27.270 --> 09:36.240
want to know the complete state of the particles complete along all the axis that X, Y, etc., because

09:36.240 --> 09:42.240
quantum mechanics does not allow them to perform further measurements on their own particles.

09:43.530 --> 09:52.260
Bob has to ask Alice what she obtained along with that access, and Alice has to ask Bob what outcome

09:52.260 --> 09:55.050
he got along the X axis.

09:56.040 --> 10:02.700
Only after receiving this information can they infer the complete state of their particles.

10:03.770 --> 10:11.420
To do so, they must use a communication channel, classical communication channel, say a contact through

10:11.420 --> 10:18.620
a radio telescope or whatever kind of classical communication channel that cannot transmit signals faster

10:18.620 --> 10:19.940
than the speed of light.

10:20.780 --> 10:25.820
They must both wait a couple million years for their respective.

10:26.810 --> 10:34.370
Cosmic telephone call, so to speak, to effectively a. and a. correlation of the spin's.

10:35.440 --> 10:43.450
Before that, Alice will not know anything about the expen value of Bob, while Bob will know nothing

10:43.450 --> 10:46.360
about that spin of a particle.

10:47.890 --> 10:57.340
So finally, while it might well be true that something in quantum in the quantum world looks like determining

10:57.340 --> 11:06.460
correlated events among particles instantly, apparently by and faster than light action, this cannot

11:06.460 --> 11:14.860
authorize us to believe that it can be used for faster than light information, transmission and communication.

11:15.310 --> 11:19.900
Correlation does not automatically imply transmission of information.

11:20.950 --> 11:28.030
In this sense, there is no contradiction between quantum mechanics and relativity, relativity is safe

11:28.030 --> 11:35.030
insofar that it imposes the no faster than light transmission of information.

11:36.280 --> 11:43.690
We must distinguish between a super luminal causation and a super luminal information exchange.

11:44.860 --> 11:52.000
The former looks to be commonplace in quantum mechanics, whereas any eventuality of the latter must

11:52.000 --> 11:52.930
be excluded.

11:54.060 --> 12:01.890
The nonlocal character of quantum mechanics is frequently invoked to explain psychic phenomena such

12:01.890 --> 12:02.910
as telepathy.

12:04.330 --> 12:11.440
However, you cannot resort to quantum mechanics to justify faster than light telepathy or mind reading,

12:12.010 --> 12:20.770
at least not quantum mechanics, as it is known in its present formulation, despite so many contrary

12:20.770 --> 12:22.610
claims in the popular media.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.900
Nothing in quantum mechanics allows for that.

12:26.890 --> 12:27.630
If this would.

12:28.830 --> 12:37.350
One day turn out to be the case, another mechanism in our brains must be at work beyond simply an epic

12:37.710 --> 12:38.490
correlation.

12:39.660 --> 12:46.500
In fact, some scientists are doing serious research to determine whether biological processes, quantum

12:46.500 --> 12:47.940
effects may be relevant.

12:49.170 --> 12:53.890
These scientists wonder whether the brain is subjected to quantum phenomenon.

12:54.670 --> 13:04.020
However, you should be aware that at this stage these are still very speculative ideas, which must

13:04.020 --> 13:04.860
be confirmed.

13:05.790 --> 13:15.240
Therefore, if you want any serious physicists to take you seriously, please realize that any statement

13:15.240 --> 13:23.460
connecting quantum mechanics to paranormal phenomenon must be taken with skepticism, or at least great

13:23.460 --> 13:25.410
care and discrimination.
