00:01.000 --> 00:08.680
As an exercise, it is instructive to play around with the Spiner or Spiner representation of the Spine

00:08.870 --> 00:14.110
One-half particle with different angles, data or data.

00:15.010 --> 00:23.130
Well, in the previous lecture I called it Spiner, but the correct pronunciation is Spiner, not Spiner.

00:23.860 --> 00:25.170
But I like the word Spiner.

00:25.180 --> 00:25.960
I don't know why.

00:26.490 --> 00:31.010
Uh, at any rate, I will try to remember that I should call it Spiner.

00:31.780 --> 00:33.400
My apologies for that.

00:35.380 --> 00:36.940
So let us take up.

00:38.220 --> 00:46.590
From the from the equation on the lecture on Spinner's this equation here and which tells us something

00:46.590 --> 00:55.890
about the state of the particles spin once it has been rotated or transformed here around the Y axis

00:55.890 --> 00:57.960
by a certain amount of degrees.

00:58.080 --> 00:58.590
Tita.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.760
If we said to equal 90 degrees, that is we rotate the spin.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.820
State vector, said Kate Plus.

01:09.250 --> 01:17.800
That was spin vector indicating along that axis, as you know, and tilt it by 90 degrees relative to

01:17.800 --> 01:28.120
the Z axis around the Y axis as shown in the figure here, then we transform the particle state into

01:28.130 --> 01:35.380
a XCAP plus state that is one spinning around the x axis.

01:35.650 --> 01:40.130
And the corresponding state vector will therefore be this one here.

01:40.270 --> 01:45.160
So we rotate it set again, state into an X and state.

01:45.700 --> 01:53.890
In fact, the cosine and sign of 45 degrees are both the same one over square two.

01:54.460 --> 02:02.890
And we can therefore write the resulting state vector as one of squared two times one one, and which

02:02.890 --> 02:09.460
is the sum of the corresponding that get plus and that minus state.

02:10.350 --> 02:19.260
Just add these two quantities here together and multiply with one over square to.

02:21.570 --> 02:23.470
This should not come as a surprise.

02:23.730 --> 02:35.910
We know that once a particle is in an iron state here, the X plus the same state must be represented

02:35.910 --> 02:40.330
as a superposition state along the other axis.

02:40.650 --> 02:44.320
This is a natural consequence of the commutation relations.

02:45.270 --> 02:52.440
We know that the spin operators do not commute and therefore one cannot determine the spin along other

02:52.440 --> 02:59.610
directions at the same time, which means that once you transform the system into another, I can state

03:00.090 --> 03:03.900
here from the Z Kate Plus to the X Kate Plus.

03:03.900 --> 03:12.120
I can state then its former spin state here again that that plus must become undetermined.

03:13.460 --> 03:22.790
And we will obtain 50 percent chance of observing the dead cat plus or that cat mindstate, which in

03:22.790 --> 03:30.200
a certain sense is gone, this should become slowly clear to you, since this is nothing else than restating

03:30.740 --> 03:37.070
in another way what we have already seen with this Garlock experiments and the computational relations,

03:37.850 --> 03:38.450
therefore.

03:39.510 --> 03:47.380
It must be described with a state function as a superposition of these two possible outcomes along that

03:47.460 --> 03:47.970
axis.

03:50.160 --> 03:55.570
What is more precisely meant by superposition was the superposition principle.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.850
We will explain in more detail in coming lectures.

04:01.140 --> 04:08.310
Meanwhile, let us see how all this implies another weird phenomenon of the quantum world.

04:09.180 --> 04:19.290
It is, at least for me, one of the most alien facts to be confronted by our naive human understanding,

04:19.620 --> 04:27.780
which is totally incomprehensible for our intuitive daily, three dimensional life experience.

04:29.990 --> 04:41.720
Check out what happens when you make a complete rotation that is set to equal 360 degrees, if we set

04:42.440 --> 04:44.990
360 degrees, that is we make.

04:46.140 --> 04:57.270
We believe to make a complete rotation, one does not get back with that plus that that cat plus state,

04:57.570 --> 05:03.380
but obtains a minus that cat plus with a minus sign in front of it.

05:04.050 --> 05:13.920
Instead, you must rotate it twice for an angle of 720 degrees to get back the island state.

05:14.130 --> 05:15.210
That cat plus.

05:17.440 --> 05:24.460
Please do not confuse the minus sign in front of the cat, which simply indicates a subtraction operator

05:24.820 --> 05:33.580
with a plus or minus signs in the spin state vector, which as usual, stands for the spin up or spin

05:33.580 --> 05:35.080
down state, respectively.

05:35.190 --> 05:35.430
Yeah.

05:36.620 --> 05:44.210
In fact, not that one can also ride, minus that Kate Plus is equal to the oil and Amber.

05:45.360 --> 05:55.380
Power I buy, which is the imaginary number times, by this time the same.

05:56.300 --> 06:05.840
Vector, I'm state vector that could last if you are not accustomed with complex Imagineer numbers and

06:05.840 --> 06:16.520
the unit circle in the complex domain, please see the appendix lecture, which describes complex numbers

06:16.880 --> 06:29.780
in which the nodes with this little minus a phase shift of the wavefunction by PI radians or equivalently

06:29.780 --> 06:34.800
by 180 degrees more on this next.

06:34.840 --> 06:40.610
Now therefore, this should not be confused with that minus Keat state.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.310
That is the minus.

06:43.310 --> 06:53.020
That gateless state is not equal that that minus get state one is the spin up and the other is spin

06:53.030 --> 06:54.110
down state.

06:54.120 --> 07:07.040
And it is not about switching from one spin state to another, but there is yet a little minus in front

07:07.040 --> 07:09.350
of the plus spin state.

07:10.570 --> 07:14.440
It is a 180 degrees phase shift.

07:15.770 --> 07:17.360
Off the state function.

07:18.920 --> 07:26.740
What this means, according to this binary representation, is that one must perform several hundred

07:26.750 --> 07:32.960
twenty degrees rotation to attain the same speed again physically.

07:33.140 --> 07:41.480
This amounts to saying that electrons, protons and neutrons as all fermions, the spin one-half particles

07:41.810 --> 07:54.050
must be rotated by at 720 degrees or four pi radians angle to return to their identical initial state.

07:54.650 --> 08:01.130
Only with two full rotations will you get back the original object.

08:02.540 --> 08:08.010
If you are wondering how this could be explained according to an intuitive geometrical understanding.

08:08.570 --> 08:10.630
Well, forget about it.

08:10.640 --> 08:18.720
It is simply a fact, a physical datum that hardly any normal human being will ever understand.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.170
I am afraid, at least I don't.

08:22.580 --> 08:27.080
However, mathematically, it is a natural consequence of group theory.

08:27.380 --> 08:34.610
When one works with complex instead of real numbers mathematically call it that.

08:35.060 --> 08:46.130
It is called the double cover symmetry of the S02 group and which again confirms the powerful application

08:46.130 --> 08:54.620
of math and physics against all our preconceived ideas of what the world is supposed to look like.

08:55.850 --> 08:59.840
Nevertheless, analogies might help our intuition.

09:00.910 --> 09:03.050
Visualize what is going on here.

09:04.210 --> 09:13.190
A typical example of an object with a 720 symmetry is a famous Mobius strip.

09:14.350 --> 09:24.580
It is obtained by cutting a band and giving one of the two ends a half twist and then attaching the

09:24.580 --> 09:25.240
two ends.

09:26.290 --> 09:30.340
The Mobius band or maybe a strip is quite famous.

09:30.380 --> 09:31.870
Probably you have already seen it.

09:32.680 --> 09:40.690
And this figure shows how a Mobius strip changes the orientation after one full rotation.

09:41.770 --> 09:51.270
Simply follow the small arrows on the boundary at the tip indicated by the large arrows parallel displaced

09:51.310 --> 10:02.350
on the surface after 360 rotation 360 degrees rotation one does not reach the initial point, but travels

10:02.350 --> 10:05.200
from the tip to the bottom of the arrows.

10:06.880 --> 10:14.740
Another full rotation is needed to return the original place where the small errors meet again and regain

10:14.980 --> 10:16.980
their original orientation.

10:18.090 --> 10:25.050
This is just an analogy that even though it cannot display the full picture of a four dimensional rotation,

10:26.010 --> 10:31.620
it helps one intuitively to grasp the spin or rotation of property.

10:33.570 --> 10:40.290
At any rate, one should refrain from thinking of spinners as being vectors spinning on the unit circle.

10:41.250 --> 10:50.670
One might also ask whether the last full rotation that transformed that cat plus into a minus that cat

10:50.670 --> 10:53.810
plus has any physical significance.

10:54.780 --> 11:02.370
After all, what we really measure experimentally is not the state factor, but it's squared modulus,

11:02.790 --> 11:08.310
which informs us about the probability of obtaining certain eigenvalues.

11:08.790 --> 11:17.490
As you should know by now, the sign in front of the Dockett might seem therefore irrelevant because

11:17.490 --> 11:19.680
the square of a negative sign.

11:20.940 --> 11:26.570
All gives a positive number, so to speak, disappears anyway.

11:28.820 --> 11:37.670
This belief is, unfortunately, something one finds also in textbooks, not only is this belief wrong,

11:37.910 --> 11:46.910
but as we will see later, this seemingly insignificant minus sign is the manifestation of one of the

11:46.910 --> 11:56.300
most fundamental laws of nature, the Pauli exclusion exclusion principle, without which the entire

11:56.300 --> 12:05.030
universe would collapse into an undifferentiated amalgam on and perhaps not even exist, at least not

12:05.030 --> 12:05.900
as we know it.

12:08.050 --> 12:12.010
In general, a phase shift of a wavefunction.

12:13.000 --> 12:25.040
Fireworks, fireworks by an angel titre is given by the prime of X equals oil, a number that is fascia

12:25.060 --> 12:30.490
and power I data that is facelift applied on the same way.

12:30.490 --> 12:34.710
Function of X again in the appendix.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.330
I discussed this a bit more in detail.

12:39.070 --> 12:42.730
Recall what we have said about the importance of a way of space.

12:43.420 --> 12:50.440
The destructive or constructive interference between two ways, between two ways depends on their relative

12:50.440 --> 12:50.890
face.

12:51.550 --> 12:57.790
Not only are waves characterized by their amplitude and wavelength or frequency, but especially when

12:57.790 --> 13:03.850
they are interfering with each other, they must be described using their face component.

13:05.030 --> 13:11.270
That's the principle on which the good old young double slit experiment works with this you already

13:11.270 --> 13:12.760
know very well by now.

13:13.340 --> 13:20.780
Therefore, the minus sign in front of the full rotated, that cut-price that get plus I can stay tells

13:20.780 --> 13:25.970
us that it must be thought of as the same state, but face shifted.

13:27.210 --> 13:35.820
So subprime effects and side effects are not the same mathematical object they represent, two waves

13:35.850 --> 13:37.530
shifted to each other.

13:39.310 --> 13:48.160
But the point is that once the state expression is model squared to obtain with the usual born rule,

13:48.580 --> 13:55.750
the outcome probability, any a shift is truncated and one might believe that it is plays no role,

13:56.860 --> 14:01.820
however, because phases play an extremely important role in interval interference phenomena.

14:02.050 --> 14:10.720
One might wonder if the strange properties of Spinner's has can be detected by some experiment which

14:11.350 --> 14:13.900
uses, uh, interference.

14:14.890 --> 14:23.340
And therefore, if it can be detected, might have any physical reality and could lead to physical effects.

14:24.370 --> 14:27.110
Or is it just a mathematical abstraction?

14:28.480 --> 14:36.110
The answer is that it is a real physical phenomenon and that could be observed in neutron interference

14:36.400 --> 14:39.730
into parametric experiments.

14:40.850 --> 14:49.070
Neutrons are fermions like electrons, but with no electric charge, therefore, they are easier to

14:49.070 --> 14:54.860
handle in experiments involving interference from other phenomena because they do not interact with

14:54.860 --> 14:56.270
the rest of the environment.

14:57.770 --> 15:05.780
Moreover, neutrons are about 800 times more massive than electrons, and they're liberally wavelength

15:05.780 --> 15:07.040
is much smaller.

15:07.370 --> 15:13.640
When they travel, travel at the same speed, they have the same momentum which allows for high precision

15:13.760 --> 15:14.450
measurements.

15:15.590 --> 15:24.260
If a neutron is sent through to Perth, as was done with photons in the double slit experiments and

15:24.260 --> 15:32.270
one performs a rotation on the neutron travelling along one path, say, with the magnet, like in the

15:33.020 --> 15:39.650
S.G. experiments, the change in the interference pattern should be observed.

15:40.640 --> 15:49.010
And in fact, this figure illustrates a neutron interferometer which uses three slices of silicon crystals,

15:49.580 --> 15:51.380
the Dasht vertical lines.

15:53.060 --> 16:01.490
And which the frat's the new Transmeta ways, as we explained, with the black diffraction experiments,

16:03.050 --> 16:10.310
so the years we should not imagine here being pece, there are no paths in the classical sense, as

16:10.310 --> 16:15.320
you should know by now, but only the propagation of spherical probability waves.

16:18.170 --> 16:28.280
However, once a detector clicks, one can buy naÃ¯f retroactive or reverse engineering reasoning, imagine

16:28.580 --> 16:37.640
the upper or lower pass, the oblique, oblique dashed lines as a trajectory the neutron has taken according

16:37.640 --> 16:38.480
to one or the other.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.570
Detector clicking.

16:39.590 --> 16:47.930
You can say that Newton when the upper or lower pass and this that's also what you will find frequently

16:47.930 --> 16:48.790
in the literature.

16:50.120 --> 16:57.200
Where they show only the path, not the spherical wave propagating.

16:58.220 --> 17:05.900
Here instead, imagine the neutrons wavefunction incident on the first slice and being directed by the

17:05.900 --> 17:07.190
crystalline lattice.

17:08.180 --> 17:16.400
Creating, therefore, an almost or approximately very good plane wave and which then is deflected again

17:16.580 --> 17:18.170
at the second crystalize.

17:19.800 --> 17:30.210
At the second layer, the new Transmeta wave sees, so to speak, the analog of the young doublets that

17:30.210 --> 17:31.180
photons see.

17:32.640 --> 17:41.250
And so to speak, then at the southerlies, the two metal waves interfere constructively or destructively

17:41.490 --> 17:42.700
or something in between.

17:43.870 --> 17:51.930
And since it is easier to detect the signal neutrons with clicking detectors and this southerlies works

17:51.930 --> 17:56.220
as a beam splitter, that is, it separates the incident.

17:56.220 --> 18:03.230
Neutron beams again in two directions with 50 percent probability towards the respective detectors.

18:04.770 --> 18:08.340
Assume the two pass having exactly equal length.

18:09.810 --> 18:16.120
Doing this is not at all an easy task from a practical point of view, because you have to align the

18:16.150 --> 18:22.050
slices with exactly billions, the tens of billions of a meter.

18:24.810 --> 18:30.030
And technically this is a quite challenging task, but not impossible can be made.

18:30.750 --> 18:35.430
So this figure shows the case with no face shift induced on the two path.

18:36.090 --> 18:42.870
An interference pattern forms along the vertical direction parallel to the crystal slices on the plane

18:43.050 --> 18:46.110
where the detectors are placed there.

18:46.530 --> 18:55.800
The upper detector, which is placed at an ATM in the ference fringe, always registers a neutral particle.

18:56.760 --> 19:02.910
The other detector be in a position where no fringe's is measurable, therefore never clicks.

19:05.670 --> 19:11.280
Instead, the same situation is shown, but with a little magnet.

19:12.270 --> 19:14.160
Put in place in the.

19:15.010 --> 19:24.250
Correct position inducing a phase shift on one of the possible neutron path effect magnet magnetic fields

19:24.490 --> 19:27.730
always shift wavefunction phases.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.450
That is, they cause Spiner rotation.

19:32.520 --> 19:40.720
Is already strange enough for a neutron, since being an electrically neutral particle, we don't expect

19:40.740 --> 19:42.490
it to have a magnetic moment.

19:43.800 --> 19:49.200
Recall how magnetic fields are always caused by circulating electric currents.

19:50.940 --> 19:58.770
This, however, only signals how the internal structure of a spinning neutron must be composed by electrically

19:58.770 --> 20:08.670
charged particles, the quarks, which however from the outside, cancel, cancel each others field

20:08.670 --> 20:11.610
and results to be apparently neutral.

20:12.960 --> 20:19.680
At any rate, this is a detail that is not so decisive here, what is essential is that the existence

20:19.680 --> 20:25.150
of a magnetic field induces a phase shift on the particles wavefunction.

20:26.370 --> 20:34.770
This phase shift is proportional to a static magnetic fields extension and or strength through which

20:34.920 --> 20:36.750
the particles travels.

20:38.110 --> 20:45.700
As stangl device also induces a phase shift on the particle it measures.

20:46.750 --> 20:54.280
Therefore, by modulating appropriately a magnetic field, one can induce on the neutron beams the desired

20:54.500 --> 20:56.500
defacing on its way function.

20:58.180 --> 21:01.030
The wavefunction we labeled as SIPRI.

21:03.270 --> 21:12.040
It turns out that after 360 shift, the place on the neutral detection screen where previously without

21:12.040 --> 21:19.680
the magnetic phase shift, the bright Frenches fringes appeared is now occupied by dark fringes and

21:19.860 --> 21:20.650
vice versa.

21:21.750 --> 21:31.050
This full rotation 360 degrees shift causes the interchange of the detectors to click.

21:32.730 --> 21:38.610
Now it is the second detector that clicks, why the first does not reveal any more Newton's.

21:40.530 --> 21:48.360
That is, if one shifts by one full turn, the face of the wavefunction, one does not obtain the same

21:48.360 --> 21:55.650
interference pattern to obtain the same interference pattern, it is necessary to shift the way functions

21:55.650 --> 22:00.930
face by 720 degrees instead of 360.

22:01.590 --> 22:10.710
This was the experimental proof that showed that the spin phase factor of particles is important.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.280
It counts later.

22:13.290 --> 22:18.910
We will find further proof of this in the Aronoff bomb effect.

22:19.980 --> 22:30.150
Meanwhile, we can say yes, spin one half particles live in a weird seven hundred twenty degrees world.

22:31.540 --> 22:39.990
This, however, only true for spin one, particles, electrons, neutrons, protons, not so full for

22:40.270 --> 22:43.660
photons as we are going now to see.
