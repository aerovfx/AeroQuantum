00:00.520 --> 00:08.890
We are now ready to understand the famous, perhaps too famous Schrodinger's cat paradox, we saw that

00:08.890 --> 00:16.660
superposition in the strange world of quantum mechanics implies that objects can be in more than one

00:16.660 --> 00:25.030
igan state simultaneously, for example, in several places at the same time, or spin clockwise and

00:25.030 --> 00:27.480
anticlockwise at the same time and so on.

00:28.090 --> 00:36.160
If you assume that you understand all this, then, as American physicist Richard Feynman used to say,

00:36.160 --> 00:39.010
you probably don't understand quantum mechanics.

00:39.970 --> 00:49.540
This totally paradoxical universe confused and eluded any reasonable explanation by the best minds of

00:49.540 --> 00:51.100
the 20th century.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.390
Until his last days, Einstein could not accept the state of affairs.

00:57.130 --> 01:05.050
This prompted other great scientists, such as the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger, to propose

01:05.050 --> 01:07.420
a slightly eccentric thought experiment.

01:08.770 --> 01:13.490
SchrÃ¶dinger wondered about the weirdness of quantum superposition principle.

01:14.440 --> 01:21.910
The question to which he was seeking an answer was why do we not observe objects in the macroscopic

01:21.910 --> 01:27.170
world in our everyday experience in superposition states?

01:28.210 --> 01:35.020
It seems that these strange and counterintuitive properties, such as superposition, emerge only in

01:35.020 --> 01:36.990
the tiny microscopic Riham.

01:37.930 --> 01:47.280
And yet there is no reason nor any known physical law that forbids the same effects from taking place,

01:47.830 --> 01:55.890
all also on larger scales for objects as big as a human body or a cat, for instance.

01:56.920 --> 02:03.220
To better visualize the problem, Schrodinger uses the cat experiment to illustrate why there is no

02:03.220 --> 02:10.810
reason to believe that superposition should not hold equally well for cats as it does for elementary

02:10.810 --> 02:11.540
particles.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.080
Here reasoned as follows.

02:15.540 --> 02:25.470
Imagine a cat in a closed box having no interaction with the outside world in the same box is a radioactive

02:25.470 --> 02:32.440
substance which at any instant can emit a particle due to atomic decay.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.960
We have learned that radioactive decays are also strictly probabilistic phenomena.

02:39.390 --> 02:44.610
It is quantum tunneling that determines the decay of an atom's nucleus.

02:45.540 --> 02:53.430
Because this quantum tunneling is a purely quantum phenomenon, you can't ever determine when an element

02:53.430 --> 02:55.410
decays before you observe it.

02:56.070 --> 03:03.960
Just as you can't say that a particle has a specific position or spin state before you measure its position

03:03.960 --> 03:06.040
or intrinsic angular momentum.

03:07.380 --> 03:14.040
So does the element which finds itself in a position of decayed and not decayed state.

03:14.820 --> 03:20.400
However, from the statistical point of view, we can predict how much average time is needed until

03:20.400 --> 03:26.820
half the atoms to decay, the so-called radioactive half half life time.

03:27.840 --> 03:33.510
This tells us the probability that the case will take place and how many decays on average will take

03:33.510 --> 03:33.900
place.

03:33.900 --> 03:42.240
After some time, however, we will never, ever be able to predict when exactly the single decay event

03:42.240 --> 03:43.080
will take place.

03:44.250 --> 03:52.380
Schrodinger, therefore imagined imagined that the box also contains a Geiger counter that is an electronic

03:52.380 --> 03:56.130
device that clicks when it detects a particle emission.

03:57.420 --> 04:05.880
When it measures a decay, it releases a hammer that breaks an ample containing poison, and then this

04:05.880 --> 04:06.990
kills the cat.

04:08.500 --> 04:15.580
However, this will occur only if that one atom of the of the radioactive substance decays.

04:16.870 --> 04:24.670
Because because this is a perfectly quantum probabilistic event, as long as we do not open the box,

04:25.180 --> 04:32.980
the wavefunction still has not collapsed according to the rules of quantum mechanics, the cat radioactive

04:32.980 --> 04:40.100
material, the hammer, the mple containing poison must be in a superposition state.

04:41.470 --> 04:44.830
This means that the apple is broken and intact.

04:45.220 --> 04:52.330
At the same time, the hammer is released and not released at the same time, and therefore the cat

04:52.510 --> 04:54.970
must be dead and alive at the same time.

04:56.080 --> 05:02.150
Only when we open the box to check on the health conditions of the animal.

05:03.020 --> 05:11.890
Does the wavefunction collapse, which means we make the observation, the act of measurement and project

05:12.040 --> 05:16.210
the cat in either the dead or alive I state.

05:17.420 --> 05:25.640
However, before the instant of observation, quantum physics seems to suggest to us that the cat indeed

05:25.640 --> 05:32.170
exists in a sort of ambiguous reality in which it is alive and dead at the same time.

05:33.140 --> 05:39.080
This is substantially the famous Schrodinger paradox, cat paradox.

05:39.980 --> 05:48.200
In fact, as in the case of the single elementary particle such as an electron, we know that it can

05:48.200 --> 05:55.880
be in a coherent state as long as it does not undergo a measurement which projects it on one of its

05:55.880 --> 05:57.950
definite Igen states.

05:58.670 --> 06:06.620
Quantum coherent means that the face relation between the way functions describing all the constituents

06:06.800 --> 06:07.910
does not change.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.650
Recall the characterisation of quantum coherence and decoherence.

06:12.650 --> 06:19.100
We applied for the phase, the relation between the two light beams in young stubbles lit experiment

06:20.180 --> 06:20.690
there.

06:20.900 --> 06:27.800
Also, the presence or non presence of the interference term that causes the appearance or disappearance

06:27.800 --> 06:36.650
of the interference fringes is per definition, the coherence or coherence between the two beams.

06:37.730 --> 06:43.010
If interference exists, the single photon is supposed to go through both slits.

06:43.550 --> 06:50.810
That is, the photon is in a coherent state which we interpret interpret as being in a superposition

06:50.810 --> 06:53.780
state and we observe the fringes.

06:54.710 --> 07:02.840
If no if no interference is present, we imagine the photon going through only one slit, which means

07:02.840 --> 07:05.000
it is in a decoherence state.

07:05.690 --> 07:11.690
There is no superposition and we observe the bell shaped probability distribution intensity curve.

07:12.790 --> 07:20.620
The same can be extended to a large number of particles, describing them as waves, the debris meter

07:20.650 --> 07:28.330
wave relation, and it's that interfere or not that is are in a coherent or coherent state.

07:30.760 --> 07:37.930
The same applies to quantum cats, as long as a measurement does not take place, the cat finds itself

07:37.930 --> 07:41.740
in the superposition dead and alive at once.

07:42.730 --> 07:49.360
This is formalized in quantum mechanics with the state's vector as a sum of the representing Keat states

07:49.630 --> 07:57.400
over the normalization coefficients or whose models square gives a 50 percent chance for one or the

07:57.400 --> 08:00.330
other case happening, as you already know by now.

08:01.330 --> 08:08.050
And then once the measurement has taken place, the system here, the cat in its superposition state

08:08.200 --> 08:16.270
is projected onto one or the other axis representing a definite igan state, dead or alive.

08:18.070 --> 08:26.350
Note how all this is nothing else than the restatement of the measurement postulate and the linearity

08:26.350 --> 08:33.670
of Schrodinger's equation before opening the box, the cat is in a linear superposition of two possible

08:33.670 --> 08:39.370
igan states as necessarily prescribed by Schrodinger's equation linearity.

08:40.330 --> 08:48.820
And once we open the box, we project the cat into one of the two igan states, which will be confirmed

08:48.820 --> 08:54.760
by any other subsequent observation as stated by the measurement postulate.

08:57.900 --> 09:04.740
With this thought experiment, Schrodinger could show that it is not at all clear why we do not observe

09:04.740 --> 09:13.890
superposition states in the macro world as the strange possibility certainly exists in the microscopic

09:13.890 --> 09:16.350
quantum world, at least in principle.

09:16.350 --> 09:23.280
At this experimental set up shows that it is possible to have quantum superposition states for beings

09:23.310 --> 09:26.370
or objects the size of a cat.

09:28.180 --> 09:36.130
Did therefore, Schrodinger find a loophole in the this concept, if quantum mechanics is true, we

09:36.130 --> 09:41.380
should be able, at least in principle, to perform such an experiment and put cats in the dead alive

09:41.380 --> 09:42.460
superposition state.

09:43.690 --> 09:49.810
However, the fact is, in our everyday life experience, nobody has observed this.

09:49.810 --> 09:51.810
So we're aware it is a mistake.

09:52.180 --> 09:55.510
Are we perhaps working with some false assumptions?

09:56.710 --> 10:04.060
Showing us at deer is only a thought experiment experiment which can can't really be performed not so

10:04.060 --> 10:10.930
much because of technical or, if you will, ethical limitations, but because one must first open the

10:10.930 --> 10:13.220
box to see in which state the cat is.

10:14.450 --> 10:20.380
However, this is an act of measurement which will cause the collapse of the state production.

10:21.100 --> 10:27.100
Therefore, we will never be able to determine how the cat felt before the box was opened.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.150
Even if the cat survives, it can tell us because cats don't speak.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.480
So guess what we are.

10:34.510 --> 10:37.150
Why not use a human instead of cat?

10:37.150 --> 10:45.100
And after the experiment, ask him or her, him or her, how it feels to be in a dead and alive superposition.

10:45.430 --> 10:48.010
Would this be an alternative idea?

10:48.770 --> 10:56.110
Fortunately, we do not have to go that far to understand why there is no real paradox.

10:57.160 --> 11:04.360
However, we must first elucidate one of the most frequent misconceptions about quantum physics, one

11:04.360 --> 11:12.700
which is frequently stirred up by many popular media, as well as by some physicists who are eager to

11:12.700 --> 11:18.880
sell their books and which is a supposed role of the observer in quantum physics.

11:19.950 --> 11:28.270
This little phrase, the role of the observer in quantum physics, has caused many misunderstandings.

11:29.100 --> 11:36.780
This is a famous YouTube video you might recognize, which suggests that there is a role of a conscious

11:36.780 --> 11:44.070
observer, the eye blinking eye here in determining where the electron or the photon or whatever kind

11:44.070 --> 11:49.710
of particle in the double slit experiment will place itself on which interference?

11:49.710 --> 11:53.700
Fringe fringe on the detector screen.

11:55.010 --> 12:02.550
It suggests more or less implicitly, the role of our mind or of our consciousness in the experiment.

12:03.710 --> 12:04.920
This is quite incorrect.

12:05.270 --> 12:08.130
What is meant by an observer in quantum physics?

12:08.900 --> 12:11.580
This is a question that we have to pose ourselves.

12:12.080 --> 12:18.440
What do we really mean by the word measurement in quantum physics and how should we distinguish it from

12:18.440 --> 12:19.650
the word observer?

12:20.510 --> 12:22.730
After all, an observer measures.

12:23.850 --> 12:24.450
Doesn't it?

12:25.390 --> 12:32.410
It is necessary to be cautious about not playing with words which might lead accidentally or intentionally

12:32.410 --> 12:40.930
to several misunderstandings and measurement in physics is, after all, nothing but a physical information

12:40.940 --> 12:50.230
readout, which we usually but not always, as we shall see later, is carried out via an interaction

12:50.230 --> 12:51.910
with the system to be measured.

12:53.200 --> 13:00.520
Is it really necessary that a measurement be linked to the observation of a conscious being like a scientist,

13:00.520 --> 13:04.330
a human being looking up and something, this is a question.

13:04.960 --> 13:10.990
The point is, and this will turn out to be of paramount importance when we when people speak about

13:10.990 --> 13:16.450
the consciousness of the observer influencing the outcome of a quantum experiment.

13:17.110 --> 13:24.430
The point is that in quantum physics, the notion of observation and measurement must be intended as

13:24.430 --> 13:30.100
being extended to any possible interaction of one system onto another.

13:32.120 --> 13:39.860
No physicist in their laboratory has ever directly observed a quantum phenomenon at the microscopic

13:39.860 --> 13:43.820
scale, every measurement is not an observation.

13:43.850 --> 13:53.570
They perform with their senses of sight or touch, but a read out performed nowadays, usually by electronic

13:53.570 --> 13:58.340
devices like photo dietze cameras with laser beams.

13:59.570 --> 14:06.320
The wavefunction collapse or state reduction is caused by a measurement that these devices make, and

14:06.320 --> 14:12.410
that has no contact whatsoever with the Observer's mind or consciousness.

14:13.820 --> 14:17.380
Should we consider the photo diode a conscious observer?

14:18.560 --> 14:27.050
Can a thermal meter measuring the temperature in a room be regarded as an observer that observes observe

14:27.230 --> 14:29.960
temperature willingly and consciously?

14:31.200 --> 14:38.490
That is, if we would also like to think of an act of measurement performed by a mechanical apparatus

14:38.490 --> 14:47.070
as an observation, it must be clear that the mind or consciousness of the scientist using using these

14:47.070 --> 14:53.730
devices to perform the experiment has nothing to do with what causes the outcome of the measurement.

14:54.930 --> 15:02.280
Therefore, this is unfortunately widespread myth of the supposed role of the human mind or consciousness

15:02.280 --> 15:08.340
in quantum physics is only a misconception that has no scientific or logical ground.

15:09.830 --> 15:17.130
Observing in the quantum mechanical sense also means the interaction of one particle onto another.

15:18.110 --> 15:23.900
There is no logical reason to believe that the interaction between two particles or between a molecule

15:24.050 --> 15:30.500
and an electron is physically and conceptually different from the interaction between two physical objects,

15:30.680 --> 15:35.990
one which is the object to be observed and the other of which is the measurement device.

15:36.590 --> 15:45.290
Measurement is always about the interaction or information transfer transfer between two material objects

15:45.650 --> 15:48.450
in quantum physics by an act of observation.

15:48.650 --> 15:54.590
We must not intend a conscious being, our only macroscopic device, but must also include the interaction

15:54.590 --> 15:56.720
of a particle with another particle.

15:57.110 --> 16:05.720
Every single interaction of the gazillions of particles in our environment is according to quantum physics

16:05.740 --> 16:07.310
measurements, so to speak.

16:07.520 --> 16:14.120
Also, a single particle onto another can cause the entire wave function that describes the entire system

16:14.120 --> 16:23.570
as a unique quantum hole in a quantum coherence state to collapse instantly into a system of its separate

16:24.350 --> 16:32.150
constituents that is into the single particles which make up the cat, the hammer and all the objects

16:32.150 --> 16:33.150
surrounding it.

16:34.010 --> 16:40.040
That is what is called quantum decoherence, quantum decoherence.

16:40.460 --> 16:48.650
But the number of molecules which make up the air, the cat's body and the surrounding objects is huge

16:48.740 --> 16:52.070
is of the order of Avogadro's number.

16:52.250 --> 17:01.020
And that is no Avogadro's is abogado number is a number which tells us how many constituents a mole

17:01.040 --> 17:02.900
of a substance is made of.

17:03.290 --> 17:09.530
For instance, for instance, a mole of water is about eight point three grams.

17:10.130 --> 17:19.310
And Avogadro's a number of states that this these eight point three grams of water are made up of six,

17:19.310 --> 17:28.190
about six point zero to two times ten to the power 23 parts.

17:29.630 --> 17:37.580
This is an extremely huge number, and if you think about about how these constituents interact with

17:37.580 --> 17:46.970
each other continuously due only to the thermo motion of the atoms and molecules, the so-called Brownian

17:47.510 --> 17:55.610
motion, the Brownian motion that this was also described by Einstein, it becomes clear that the decoherence

17:55.610 --> 18:04.860
time must be vanishingly small only because of the interaction with the thermal excitations in the environment.

18:05.690 --> 18:08.600
This is called thermal decoherence.

18:09.580 --> 18:15.880
So does this imply that a single particle could collapse the way function of a quantum system?

18:17.080 --> 18:20.520
Well, things are a bit trickier than that.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.030
It turns out that it is only part of the truth.

18:24.730 --> 18:28.900
It's sold the Schrodinger's cat paradox only partially.

18:29.710 --> 18:36.940
In fact, in quantum mechanics, several particles can also be entangled and in quantum position while

18:37.120 --> 18:39.830
they are interacting with other particles.

18:40.480 --> 18:46.930
But this does not necessarily immediately lead to what we imagine as the wavefunction collapse.

18:48.370 --> 18:51.940
In fact, to have Schrodinger's cat experiments succeed.

18:52.480 --> 18:59.980
Not only must the tiny atom be in superposition state, that is, we can describe the state function

18:59.990 --> 19:08.740
BPCI as a some decade plus not decayed, but this is a superposition must also hold, at least for a

19:08.740 --> 19:15.690
short time, for all the atoms and molecules of which the Geiger counters, the hammer and the poison,

19:15.850 --> 19:23.410
the walls of the box, the air molecules in the box, and especially all the cells of the body of the

19:23.410 --> 19:31.810
cat are made, and with them all being quantum entangled in a unique and coherent whole.

19:32.410 --> 19:38.830
All the particles, quantum decoherence still does not completely explain quantum collapse.

19:39.760 --> 19:44.320
It tells us only that few particles get entangled with many.

19:45.070 --> 19:52.480
But that does not alone avoid the possibility to observe entangled objects also at microscopic scales.

19:53.410 --> 19:59.470
Still, after the opening of the box, we should see the cat in a superposition state entangled with

19:59.470 --> 20:05.410
all the particles or the environment, even though only four eventually only maybe a very short time.

20:05.980 --> 20:14.410
And since nobody has ever observed such a weird thing, there is a conceptual disconnect between what

20:14.410 --> 20:20.590
quantum mechanics suggests microscopically and what we experience macroscopically.

20:21.840 --> 20:28.770
Furthermore, since quantum decoherence does not really explain quantum collapse, not how this seems

20:28.770 --> 20:37.710
to imply that for macroscopic objects as we are, the linearity of Schrodinger's equation is violated

20:37.980 --> 20:41.410
and the measurement postulate remains unexplained.

20:42.240 --> 20:46.080
That's why it has been framed axiomatically as a postulate.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.470
After all, at what scale?

20:49.710 --> 20:58.350
Why and how does nature prevent linear superposition to take place, which it allows for at microscopic

20:58.350 --> 20:58.940
scales?

20:59.820 --> 21:02.820
And what is the true cause of the quantum collapse?

21:03.780 --> 21:09.300
This disconnect is an aspect of what is called the measurement of the quantum measurement problem,

21:09.900 --> 21:17.700
and in the next lecture, we will see how the Schrodinger's cat paradox can find only a partial solution

21:18.000 --> 21:23.280
with what is called the quantum decoherence process and in what sense.

21:23.280 --> 21:29.090
The measurement problem still leaves some questions open until the until today.
