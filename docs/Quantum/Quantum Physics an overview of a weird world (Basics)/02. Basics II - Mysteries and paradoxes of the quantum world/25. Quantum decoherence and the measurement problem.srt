00:00.960 --> 00:07.230
This is a somewhat more advanced lecture on decoherence and quantum decoherence and the measurement

00:07.230 --> 00:15.180
problem where we will make a bit more use of a formal mathematical description, if you feel uncomfortable

00:15.180 --> 00:18.940
with this, you can eventually also skip this single lecture.

00:19.530 --> 00:25.280
It is not so necessary for the understanding of the content or content of the following lectures.

00:26.100 --> 00:32.880
However, it is important for those who will eventually continue to research further in the quantum

00:32.880 --> 00:38.900
philosophical domain, so to speak, especially that concerned with the measurement measurement problem.

00:39.810 --> 00:45.630
It is also interesting in the sense that it represents still an unsolved problem of quantum physics,

00:45.780 --> 00:54.060
at least from the more philosophical foundational point of view, and might be useful if you intend

00:54.060 --> 01:02.730
to go deeper and dig further later on in dealing with these typical modern issues that philosophers

01:02.730 --> 01:05.400
of science are busy, busy with.

01:06.840 --> 01:13.330
In a in a previous lecture, we saw how the Schrodinger's cat paradox shows a paradoxical aspect of

01:13.330 --> 01:14.240
quantum mechanics.

01:14.260 --> 01:20.590
There is no reason to believe that quantum superposition, as every quantum law should hold only in

01:20.590 --> 01:23.590
the macroscopic area of particle physics.

01:24.280 --> 01:30.210
Quantum mechanics should hold equally well also at the scales of humans, cats or coins.

01:30.850 --> 01:38.890
Therefore, it is somehow a mystery why we can't set cats or any other living beings or objects into

01:38.890 --> 01:46.690
a life and death quantum superposition or coin in their heads and tails superposition at the same time,

01:47.050 --> 01:50.930
just as we can do with the particles spin.

01:51.220 --> 02:00.220
For example, we advance the hypothesis that somehow this could be explained away with the mutual interaction

02:00.220 --> 02:08.140
of particles of the cat's body scattering with the particles of the cat's body itself and all those

02:08.140 --> 02:14.740
of the environment that could cause the immediate collapse of the wavefunction and which is called also

02:14.740 --> 02:16.720
the decoherence process.

02:17.710 --> 02:24.660
Let us look at this somewhat further, in fact, that this state of affairs cannot be taken so, so

02:24.840 --> 02:32.260
lightly in quantum mechanics is illustrated through an application of Dirac's notation to a system that

02:32.260 --> 02:38.650
transitions from a superposition to a definite state that is to one of its agan states.

02:39.630 --> 02:47.490
Consider first an isolated system in a generic superposition state, and that does not interact with

02:47.490 --> 02:49.140
the with the environment.

02:50.150 --> 02:52.670
With, as usual, that.

02:54.060 --> 03:04.770
State vector BPCI given as some of the two igan states, A and B over a square two, which is of course,

03:04.770 --> 03:08.880
as usual, as you should know by now, that probability coefficient.

03:10.830 --> 03:20.280
And a and being, for example, spin up or down or kept alive and dead or generally two mutually exclusive

03:20.280 --> 03:28.260
igan states that is orthogonal physical states, when you describe it with the vectors you in a three

03:28.260 --> 03:35.910
dimensional vector space, you can recall that we describe it as two orthogonal vectors.

03:37.140 --> 03:44.130
If we want to calculate the probability that the Squantum system will change from a state BPCI to one

03:45.210 --> 03:53.610
of the two possible states say kept a record a we must work with the transition amplitude we introduced

03:53.610 --> 04:00.390
in the lecture on the state vector and Schrodinger's equation, namely that the probability of a transition

04:00.390 --> 04:08.460
from an initial state bracket BPCI to a final final state of A is given by this little formula that

04:08.460 --> 04:17.880
we discussed in that occasion, and which is the square models of the inner product of C and A.

04:18.900 --> 04:25.740
Now to proceed, you should know how to calculate a model squared, often in a product, if you are

04:25.740 --> 04:33.300
not acquainted, acquainted with this, please see also in the appendix where we dealt with this, it

04:33.300 --> 04:41.400
is the part which deals with the addition of two complex Wavves which added together and squared deliver

04:41.430 --> 04:53.820
the intensity of a beam with an associated interference term that are also how we calculated the interference

04:53.820 --> 04:56.840
fringes with a double slit experiment.

04:57.210 --> 05:04.150
Go back there and you will recall and we'll see how we are substantially doing the same thing.

05:04.470 --> 05:09.830
So let us do this here with the coherent state side.

05:11.010 --> 05:20.820
And if we take this expression for BPCI and take the model square with the Cat Agan state, we obtain

05:20.850 --> 05:21.810
this expression.

05:22.830 --> 05:30.480
That is, we simply insert the superposition state in this model square.

05:31.140 --> 05:39.750
In a further step, we calculate using the distributive law or the distributive rule.

05:40.860 --> 05:47.590
And we have the model square of a bracket, A plus a mixed term.

05:49.800 --> 05:54.150
Brought a cat B over of, of course, square to.

05:55.080 --> 06:05.070
Square it this, again, is equal to one half, obviously, because one of the square, two square is

06:05.070 --> 06:15.210
one 1/2 times the model, the square of the numerator here, which, if expanded, becomes this expression

06:15.210 --> 06:20.710
here, because recall that the Model Square is nothing as of quantity.

06:20.730 --> 06:26.910
The model square of a quantity is nothing else than the product of this quantity times its own complex

06:26.910 --> 06:27.540
conjugate.

06:27.930 --> 06:33.890
Therefore, we have here at the start the complex times the same value.

06:35.070 --> 06:36.680
This again is equal.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.370
We calculate now again with a distributive law.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.780
We take this to brackets.

06:42.780 --> 06:52.350
Here you have the complex conjugate times itself of the bracket A, which means that we have on one

06:52.350 --> 07:04.920
side we collect the terms and we obtain one half times the model square of bracket A plus one half model

07:04.920 --> 07:15.750
square of bread bracket A, B, the mixed terms and a more complicated term expression here, which

07:15.750 --> 07:22.950
is in fact complicated, but it is not so important to understand what its real meaning is term by term.

07:23.160 --> 07:33.360
We just sum this up and have a more compact term, obtaining again one half of the square of bracket

07:33.390 --> 07:44.370
A plus and term that we will call the interference term, because here this term expresses the interference

07:44.370 --> 07:48.420
between A and B, the two possible igan states.

07:48.990 --> 07:59.820
It contains the combined inner products products of Coté and can be it can be called an interference

07:59.820 --> 08:05.700
term because it is the same type of inter interference term we encountered in the double slit experiment

08:05.700 --> 08:06.450
in the electron.

08:06.450 --> 08:09.060
The double slit experiment we only.

08:10.040 --> 08:18.000
Exchanged, we only replaced the two light beams, side one and side two with here, in our case with

08:18.000 --> 08:25.310
a two Igan States, A and B. However, here, this has been set to zero in the last passage for the

08:25.310 --> 08:34.850
simple reason that the inner product of bracket A B equals bracket pay is zero because the inner product

08:34.850 --> 08:37.850
of orthogonal state vectors is zero.

08:38.660 --> 08:46.670
Recall how we encountered our orthogonality for spin states in the electoral lecture on Spinous and

08:46.670 --> 08:52.910
what remains is just what we already know, namely that there is a 50 percent chance of getting state

08:52.910 --> 08:53.630
bracket eight.

08:54.890 --> 08:55.880
This is fortunate.

08:56.660 --> 09:06.230
Otherwise those remaining terms would not make much sense if the inner product of bracket baby AI were

09:06.230 --> 09:12.950
not equal to zero, it would mean that there is still a non-zero probability that we could measure the

09:12.950 --> 09:20.240
system still being in two states in the same sentence at the same time against anything our worldly

09:20.240 --> 09:22.070
experience suggests.

09:23.730 --> 09:32.580
The disappearance of this interference term is a formal mathematical representation of the quantum decoherence

09:32.580 --> 09:33.270
process.

09:34.260 --> 09:41.940
It is this decoherence process people invoke to explain why microscopic bodies never show up with quantum

09:41.940 --> 09:42.690
properties.

09:44.560 --> 09:48.310
However, this is true only for a system in isolation.

09:49.360 --> 09:59.290
The fact is these conditions are very rarely met, any system that is not in a perfect vacuum will quickly

09:59.290 --> 10:02.890
somehow interact with its surrounding environment.

10:04.150 --> 10:10.750
Moreover, if we perform a measurement with some microscopic device, we must also take into account

10:10.750 --> 10:12.460
all the interactions with it.

10:13.820 --> 10:21.580
This means all the quantum states of the system to be measured will be will become entangled with a

10:21.800 --> 10:29.780
virtually infinite number of particles of all the environment, plus the measurement apparatus.

10:31.610 --> 10:42.920
Formally, this implies that the igan basis of the quantum system in our case get A and B, but its

10:42.920 --> 10:52.100
interaction with the external macroscopic world will become entangled with the environment and the apparatus

10:52.100 --> 10:53.560
as a whole as well.

10:54.670 --> 11:02.470
Let us therefore level the igan basis of all the possible quantum states of the environment, together

11:02.630 --> 11:13.480
with the measurement apparatus as Khaddafi, I wear the index, I runs over the virtually infinite number

11:13.510 --> 11:14.620
of igan states.

11:15.730 --> 11:22.110
Then the general environment and apparatus quantum state could be represented as a product over all

11:22.120 --> 11:25.090
of these all of all these igan states.

11:25.090 --> 11:36.520
As a Khaddafi, a level with Aetate, which stands for Environment A for the apparatus equals the product

11:36.520 --> 11:40.090
of one timeously to two, three and so on.

11:41.720 --> 11:49.240
Then the quantum state of the system entangled with the macroscopic world could be written as follows,

11:49.700 --> 12:02.030
that is now we have a new state side of the whole system and is represented by the capsid EPA, which

12:02.030 --> 12:11.810
is nothing else than the product of Capsid, the site that we had in the previous case in the isolated

12:12.170 --> 12:12.530
case.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.600
But this time it is not isolated.

12:14.630 --> 12:24.680
Therefore, we must take the product Khaddafi, E.A., and which if we calculate it explicitly, we

12:24.680 --> 12:28.660
obtain this expression here and which is nothing else.

12:28.670 --> 12:34.790
And the product of the previous superposition state times the Khaddafi E.A..

12:36.550 --> 12:44.080
Repeating then the calculation above all over again with this last term, which is quite cumbersome

12:44.080 --> 12:51.820
because it entails a multiplication of brackets running on the index eye and which we omit here, one

12:51.820 --> 12:59.890
obtains an analogous result as a previous equation, but extended to the environment and apparatus as

12:59.890 --> 13:00.220
well.

13:01.600 --> 13:09.430
So what we obtain here is a system driven amplitude between the state side of the system.

13:10.720 --> 13:18.850
To, uh, from a superposition state outside of the system to its igan state, A. under the condition

13:19.300 --> 13:29.160
that it is entangled also with the environment and the measurement apparatus formally, this goes as

13:29.170 --> 13:40.900
a model, the square of that bracket, a sigh of a and which is equal, again, as previously one half

13:41.380 --> 13:45.170
of the model square of the bracket A..

13:45.820 --> 13:54.700
This time, however, over a that means with entangled with environment plus an interference term.

13:56.120 --> 13:56.630
Of.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.550
Bracket B a.

14:01.050 --> 14:13.290
And where we use the shorthand that get a E.A. is equal, cut eight times the product of kaffiyeh and

14:13.290 --> 14:25.160
analogously Cat B is equal, B times FITA and with the interference term.

14:25.350 --> 14:34.230
But this time we cannot sweep under the carpet so easily by setting it to a zero value, because this

14:34.230 --> 14:44.490
mix term here, the bracket B A over the environment is the inner product of interacting igan basis

14:44.880 --> 14:49.150
that is non also non orthogonal basis.

14:50.460 --> 14:58.770
What this seems to suggest to us is that at least for a short time, the Kwanten system must be in the

14:58.860 --> 15:05.190
in its superposition state, which is truly entangled with the external world.

15:07.210 --> 15:14.770
So the upshot is that there is effectively a quantum interference between the object and its surroundings.

15:15.970 --> 15:22.990
This is another way of seeing quantum coherence extended to quantum systems, quantum systems that we

15:22.990 --> 15:25.530
imagine are made of many particles.

15:26.080 --> 15:34.390
In other words, we should truly observe the cat alive and dead at the same time, because now, since

15:34.390 --> 15:42.730
we have no longer orthogonal and orthogonal basis, the inner product baby does not disappear.

15:43.060 --> 15:44.020
It's still there.

15:45.560 --> 15:54.440
The fact that the decoherence interference term does not vanish, that is still some coherence seems

15:54.440 --> 16:01.820
to be present also after the measurement is contrary to whatever we know in quantum as in classical

16:01.820 --> 16:02.480
mechanics.

16:04.540 --> 16:10.150
However, the question is, how short is that short time of coherence?

16:12.310 --> 16:20.830
One can show that this loss of coherence, the so-called quantum decoherence or course on timescales

16:21.310 --> 16:28.510
that are inversely proportional to the number of particles involved and decreases exponentially with

16:28.510 --> 16:28.900
time.

16:30.330 --> 16:37.860
The number of molecules which make up the air, the cat's body and the surrounding objects and the measurement

16:38.040 --> 16:41.510
apparatus is of the order of Avogadro's number.

16:41.820 --> 16:49.450
And we already discussed in the lecture on the Schrodinger's cat paradox how huge this number is.

16:49.470 --> 16:59.310
It's something about the order of 10 to the power 23, and that because of this huge number of particles,

16:59.310 --> 17:02.350
the interference term had to disappear.

17:02.610 --> 17:08.110
And here we are discussing how fast does it disappear.

17:08.850 --> 17:16.020
And so according to this understanding of what is going on is that the macroscopic objects could also,

17:16.500 --> 17:20.760
in principle be in superposition or in an entangled state.

17:21.240 --> 17:33.330
But due to the Brownian motion, this thermal decoherence is extremely fast because the number of particles

17:33.330 --> 17:41.430
involved in this Brownian motion, in this thermal decoherence is so huge that the time interval of

17:41.910 --> 17:51.090
being in superposition is so ultra short that it can be considered, for all practical purposes, as

17:51.090 --> 17:52.140
instantaneous.

17:53.710 --> 18:01.750
Quantum decoherence sets in extremely quickly, and we won't notice anything strange that might suggest

18:01.750 --> 18:10.990
anything other than our good old classical world where cats live or dead or alive, but not both, but

18:10.990 --> 18:13.750
for an extremely short time interval.

18:14.080 --> 18:22.480
According to quantum physics, it is indeed possible to have cats in a superposition dead and alive.

18:23.670 --> 18:30.270
In principle, to avoid decoherence, we must be able to perfectly maintain the coherence of all the

18:30.270 --> 18:36.750
particles of the environment and every measurement device by eliminating the thermal agitation.

18:37.770 --> 18:43.950
This, in turn, would practically mean that any measurement device could not function in the first

18:43.950 --> 18:51.780
place and that the poor cat must be frozen to an absolute zero temperature, which, by the way, would

18:51.780 --> 18:55.980
at least solve that dead or alive dilemma from the outset.

18:57.570 --> 19:04.890
So when we consider a huge macroscopic systems which are not cooled down to absolute zero temperature

19:04.980 --> 19:12.630
and are not placed into very special physical conditions, we will never, ever observe quantum coherence.

19:12.990 --> 19:18.140
That is anything in quantum entanglement or in quantum superposition state.

19:18.870 --> 19:24.130
It is not that the laws of quantum physics no longer hold the hold at all levels.

19:24.810 --> 19:30.270
However, for large objects or the quantum effects disappear almost instantly.

19:32.220 --> 19:40.440
Nowadays, exceptions to this can nevertheless be realized with the so-called Bose Einstein condensate

19:40.890 --> 19:51.870
by complicated procedures placing a gas of helium in a container at fractions of degrees Kelvin avoiding

19:51.870 --> 19:54.450
its contact with the chamber walls.

19:55.320 --> 20:02.520
The realization of the Einstein condensate is in fact show that it is possible to create a relatively

20:02.520 --> 20:11.400
macroscopic systems less than a millimeter in diameter that are in a coherent state.

20:12.180 --> 20:13.820
So this is possible.

20:14.770 --> 20:22.030
And finally, the so-called Schrodinger's cat paradox is not a paradox at all, it can be explained

20:22.030 --> 20:28.750
with quantum decoherence taking place in very short times because of the interaction between the huge

20:28.750 --> 20:35.230
number of particles of which a macroscopic system is made and the particles of the rest of the environment.

20:36.370 --> 20:40.330
This is at present the most acceptable explanation.

20:41.020 --> 20:46.060
Showing us contribution was to point out that there is no reason to believe that, at least in principle,

20:46.060 --> 20:52.090
quantum superposition is a scale dependent, universal future of physical reality.

20:52.930 --> 20:56.090
However, the story still does not end here.

20:56.680 --> 21:04.120
One also hears professional physicists not particularly informed in the foundations of quantum physics,

21:04.510 --> 21:10.840
say that decoherence decoherence process solves the measurement problem.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.330
This is not completely correct.

21:13.930 --> 21:20.950
The quantum decoherence provides an explanation of why Schrodinger's cat paradox is not a paradox,

21:21.400 --> 21:24.390
but it does not entirely solve the measurement problem.

21:25.090 --> 21:31.990
Decoherence explains why we perceive objects as being classical, together with Borse corespondents

21:31.990 --> 21:32.530
principle.

21:33.590 --> 21:39.560
According to this principal, classical physics is a limiting case of quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics,

21:39.560 --> 21:45.070
that is quantum mechanics who produces quantum physics in the statistical limit of large quantum numbers.

21:46.290 --> 21:53.520
For example, recall how the the increase in energy quantum numbers behaves in the limit as a large

21:53.670 --> 22:03.990
or as large orbit's or large energy as we saw in Bors atomic model or how quantum numbers determine

22:03.990 --> 22:08.040
the orbitals, as we discussed in the lecture on atomic orbitals.

22:09.860 --> 22:16.580
However, note that decoherence is, strictly speaking, not the usual way function collapse, rather

22:16.580 --> 22:20.030
it is, so to speak, a quick interference suppression.

22:21.350 --> 22:29.720
The Schrodinger cat paradox cannot be explained with the coherence alone, the coherence souls, the

22:29.720 --> 22:39.410
measurement problem only partially as it still leaves open an anomaly that is intrinsic in the formalism

22:39.410 --> 22:47.330
of quantum mechanics as fast as it might be, decoherence should be described by an evolution in time

22:47.960 --> 22:53.690
described with the evolution operator, the unitary operator we discussed, and that, as you might

22:53.690 --> 23:00.290
recall again in the lecture on the Schrodinger equation in which I display here again for your convenience.

23:01.900 --> 23:07.720
In general, we spoke of the evolution, quantum evolution of a system, of a quantum system from a

23:07.720 --> 23:20.560
time zero to a time T. And we displayed this with a quantum state vector BPCI at time zero, which goes

23:20.560 --> 23:31.990
into BPCI at time T. This was described with a unitary operator, unitary because it's complex conjugate

23:31.990 --> 23:40.180
times itself gives identity or one if you prefer, and is described also with exponential function.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.430
And the Hamiltonian Hamiltonian.

23:42.430 --> 23:49.510
If you don't remember this, go back to the lecture we where we discussed this, at which this unitary

23:49.510 --> 23:57.610
operator transports, so to speak, evolves the state vector at time zero zero.

23:58.550 --> 24:07.910
To state better at a time to step back to apply so the application of this unitary operator describes

24:07.910 --> 24:10.280
the quantum evolution of the system.

24:12.940 --> 24:20.440
If so, in our case, the same unitary operator must describe the time evolution from the quantum state

24:20.440 --> 24:26.650
of the system entangled with the macroscopic world, that is a state entangled with the environment,

24:26.650 --> 24:35.140
plus the measurement apparatus, and that we can label as cat, BPCI, E.A. to one of the two possible

24:35.140 --> 24:37.360
macroscopic state outcomes.

24:37.690 --> 24:45.910
And that we describe this time also analogously CAT, a E.A. as also.

24:46.880 --> 24:52.550
Get BGA, because these are two different possible outcomes of the same initial state.

24:53.740 --> 25:06.880
Informal language, this implies that Keat, a E.A., is the result of a time evolution of capsid.

25:07.880 --> 25:11.420
Entangled with the environment and the apparatus.

25:13.070 --> 25:23.330
Under the application of the unitary operator, that is, you times the cat CETA and at for the same

25:23.330 --> 25:27.390
reason, this one that can't be E.A. is equal.

25:27.390 --> 25:35.900
If you applied on to the state vector capsid, E.A. then recall also from the lecture on the direct

25:35.900 --> 25:45.650
notation, that indirect notation, the model is squared off the in a product of BPCI with itself.

25:46.700 --> 25:54.980
Is equal one just because it is the sum of all the probability coefficients and which obviously must

25:55.100 --> 26:03.680
be certainty, then applying, putting this together, we can right that the transition probability

26:04.430 --> 26:14.240
from a state A to a state B of a system microscopic system, which is, however, entangled with the

26:14.240 --> 26:17.840
environment and eventually a measurement apparatus.

26:18.380 --> 26:22.490
And with that we can describe with this bracket A B.

26:23.510 --> 26:36.860
With level E.A. is equal to the same bracket where we replace the A and B states by their description

26:36.860 --> 26:46.460
with the evolution operator as as the outcome of an evolved state from side to a or from side to B,

26:47.330 --> 26:49.310
then we obtain this expression here.

26:50.430 --> 27:00.600
But you start you is per definition of unitary operator one, therefore, we obtain, we reduce this

27:00.600 --> 27:02.700
expression reduces to this expression.

27:04.290 --> 27:10.640
With the identity operator in between and since this is an identity operator, it can be left out,

27:10.640 --> 27:12.870
just is just the multiplication by unity.

27:13.470 --> 27:20.460
So we arrive at this expression here, the inner product of PSI.

27:21.060 --> 27:21.380
Right.

27:21.690 --> 27:24.630
And as we said, this must be equal one.

27:26.270 --> 27:33.440
This, however, is a strange result because this means that indeed we have certainty to observe the

27:33.440 --> 27:35.240
two states and superposition.

27:36.300 --> 27:41.910
Also at the microscopic environmental scale of the measurement apparatus or the cat.

27:43.160 --> 27:51.020
This is contrary to the previous statement that due to decoherence, the interference term is rapidly

27:51.020 --> 27:51.710
suppressed.

27:52.370 --> 28:00.630
That is previously we had that the bracket A B of A with the environment is equal zero.

28:01.640 --> 28:08.960
So this has led us to a contradiction that this contradiction is somehow intrinsic to the mathematical

28:08.960 --> 28:18.080
description of quantum mechanics and emerges when we resort to decoherence only as a solution to the

28:18.080 --> 28:18.980
measurement problem.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.840
But with that, we have proven that it isn't.

28:24.200 --> 28:31.340
Here, the main discrepancy with the known rules of quantum mechanics is that besides the violation

28:31.340 --> 28:37.970
of the linearity of Schrodinger's equation and the measurement postulate also unitary t seems to be

28:37.970 --> 28:38.740
violated.

28:38.870 --> 28:40.400
That is this expression here.

28:43.550 --> 28:54.530
This is one of the most fundamental pillars of the rules of quantum mechanics, as we have discussed

28:54.530 --> 28:59.420
in the lecture on training on the training equation.

28:59.780 --> 29:10.280
It guarantees that the theory is time reversal invariant, which means that if a operator, you evolve

29:10.420 --> 29:19.040
the system forward in time, the complex conjugate of it that is used to evolve it backwards in time,

29:19.610 --> 29:29.150
implying that the product you start, you must keep that identity necessarily because so it means that

29:29.150 --> 29:36.020
you go back and forth in time and you get the same system as in the initial conditions.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.500
If that would be incorrect.

29:38.510 --> 29:44.920
Everything what quantum mechanics tells us the theory of quantum mechanics tells us would be wrong.

29:45.890 --> 29:49.700
And yet we know it works another way.

29:49.730 --> 29:55.760
Another way to state what the measurement problem is all about is to recognize how the physical state

29:55.760 --> 30:04.190
of a large object like a detector is not deducible from the properties of the quantum state of the small

30:04.190 --> 30:08.450
objects, it is made up of the measurement postulate.

30:08.540 --> 30:14.610
The linearity of Schrödinger's equation and unique clarity are at odds with reductionism.

30:15.740 --> 30:21.950
The issue is still debated among physicists and perhaps even more among philosophers, because it does

30:21.950 --> 30:28.880
not really prevent, uh, physicists from carrying out their calculations and make precise predictions

30:29.270 --> 30:32.240
on the macroscopic scale with elementary particles.

30:33.210 --> 30:40.640
Uh, some of the interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as the many world interpretations, the

30:40.640 --> 30:49.190
Bali bomb pilot wave or the object of collapse interpretation, these are very different interpretations

30:49.190 --> 30:54.240
that we eventually will discuss, could in principle resolve this contradiction.

30:55.160 --> 31:02.030
However, these interpretations why they reproduce the predictions of quantum physics and are empirically

31:02.030 --> 31:10.460
indistinguishable from the orthodox theory, and which is why they are called interpretations, also

31:10.460 --> 31:14.470
suggests mutually exclusive ontologies.

31:14.930 --> 31:22.170
Nobody knows which must be preferred and whether any of it at all has something to do with reality.

31:23.450 --> 31:27.350
Maybe this shows us that Einstein was not so wrong.

31:27.350 --> 31:32.530
After all, quantum mechanics might not be so complete them.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.380
Some seems to be still something missing.

31:35.840 --> 31:43.070
However, whatever resolution the measurement problem might find inside an alternative complete description

31:43.070 --> 31:50.420
of reality, it's certainly it certainly will not be that for which Einstein had hoped for.

31:51.200 --> 31:59.000
Moreover, also, what all this tells us is that we still have not a clear understanding what at bottom

31:59.540 --> 32:00.650
a measurement is.

32:01.860 --> 32:12.450
It is something somehow unclear, it remains an overall intuitive concept and this concept of measurement

32:12.540 --> 32:20.700
and that everyone speaks about, but it escapes a precise and clear definition that does not lead to

32:20.700 --> 32:23.100
contradictions or paradoxes.

32:24.140 --> 32:33.650
So finally, the measurement problem is still not solved, and this shows us that we still do not understand

32:33.650 --> 32:42.740
completely why there is this divide between the classical world as we experience it and the quantum

32:42.740 --> 32:43.100
world.
