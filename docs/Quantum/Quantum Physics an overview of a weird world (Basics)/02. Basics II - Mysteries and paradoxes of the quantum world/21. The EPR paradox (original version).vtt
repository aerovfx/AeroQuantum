It was the year 1935 Einstein's debate with Barr saw the letter emerge as the winner.

00:11.100 --> 00:19.320
Yet Einstein did not give up in a famous paper entitled Can Quantum Mechanical Description of Physical

00:19.320 --> 00:21.240
Reality Be Considered Complete?

00:22.020 --> 00:32.370
Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, they're from the acronym EPSA, proposed an interesting

00:32.550 --> 00:39.200
thought experiment which was supposed to show why quantum mechanics cannot be complete after all.

00:39.900 --> 00:48.420
As so, at least their argument to end it inherently contains a statement which denies physical reality.

00:49.260 --> 00:56.490
If by physical reality we mean any physical quantity that can in principle be determined with certainty.

00:57.550 --> 01:04.620
To show what they felt was inconsistent with the present formulation of quantum mechanics, Epper Cho's

01:04.630 --> 01:11.020
position, momentum complimentarity, we know that if we precisely measure the position of a particle,

01:11.020 --> 01:14.580
we will lose information about its momentum and vice versa.

01:14.770 --> 01:20.920
If we measure its momentum, we can no longer say something precise about its position, not because

01:20.920 --> 01:28.060
of an interaction between the measurement device and the particle, but because of a fundamental inherent

01:28.060 --> 01:32.770
indefiniteness of these quantities intrinsically in themselves.

01:34.090 --> 01:41.530
That's Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that I hope you know, and now by now, you grasp this important

01:41.530 --> 01:42.160
distinction.

01:42.940 --> 01:51.460
So what was the EPRI argument, which so they believed shows that there is a possibility of overcoming

01:51.460 --> 01:52.630
this limitation?

01:53.710 --> 01:58.210
If you understand the real meaning of the complementarity between position and momentum expressed by

01:58.210 --> 02:06.640
the commutation relation, it is easy to understand what they had in mind by using the following measuring

02:06.640 --> 02:10.480
scheme applied to a system of entangled particles.

02:11.350 --> 02:19.000
Suppose we have a source which we assume to be addressed relative to our laboratory that produces by

02:19.240 --> 02:27.730
a nuclear nuclear decay process, for example, two entangled particles which fly apart into two different

02:27.730 --> 02:31.840
and opposite directions, like the figure here.

02:33.560 --> 02:40.730
Then, according to our standard, an intuitive understanding of Newtonian dynamics, which, as everyone

02:40.730 --> 02:47.690
knows, implies the conservation of energy and momentum, we should think of each particle as having

02:47.690 --> 02:50.240
the same, but contrary momentum.

02:51.740 --> 02:57.950
That is P for particle A and minus P for particle B.

02:59.670 --> 03:10.620
Now measure the position of position X of one particle, say particle A, for example, by inserting

03:10.620 --> 03:17.850
a tiny pinhole in its path or whatever, but without making any attempt to gain information about its

03:17.850 --> 03:18.330
momentum.

03:18.350 --> 03:24.150
P Because we know according to quantum mechanics we have, we are not allowed to know the position and

03:24.150 --> 03:30.270
momentum at the same time, because otherwise once we measure the momentum, we will destroy the information

03:30.270 --> 03:31.530
over its position again.

03:32.460 --> 03:38.850
So we perform only one position measurement on Particle A and get the measurement result X.

03:40.050 --> 03:46.200
With this information, we should have also established the position of particle B, at least according

03:46.200 --> 03:52.910
to our common sense, as it was ejected from the source at the same time and with the same momentum

03:53.190 --> 03:56.640
that means the same velocity in the opposite direction.

03:57.760 --> 04:05.890
Therefore, at the time of the measurement, the position of particle B must have been minus X, we

04:05.890 --> 04:12.670
can deduce this without any measurement, simply by an inference which relies only on the assumption

04:12.790 --> 04:15.860
that the conservation of energy and momentum holds.

04:16.420 --> 04:24.430
The interesting point is that because so far no measurement on Particle B has been made, quantum mechanics

04:24.430 --> 04:26.890
allows us to make a second measurement.

04:27.550 --> 04:31.090
The measurement of the momentum of the second particle.

04:31.090 --> 04:31.360
B.

04:32.610 --> 04:38.640
Measuring momenta is somewhat more complicated from a practical point of view, but not not impossible

04:38.640 --> 04:45.330
in principle, as long as we make the second measurement on the second particle B, quantum mechanics

04:45.330 --> 04:47.800
has no objections now.

04:49.290 --> 04:53.820
By doing that, we have the momentum minus P of particle B.

04:54.960 --> 05:01.500
And again, for the conservation laws, we deduce from that without any measurement that the momentum

05:01.500 --> 05:04.400
of a particle A must have been P.

05:05.530 --> 05:11.860
Therefore, by this thought experiment, we can, at least in principle, retrieve the position X and

05:11.860 --> 05:21.760
momentum P of Particle A and also the position minus X and momentum minus P of particle B without having

05:21.760 --> 05:25.870
to measure both position and momentum on the same particle.

05:27.110 --> 05:35.180
And this apparently having deceived nature, so to speak, which imposes the connotation relation on

05:35.180 --> 05:41.180
these observables, stating the impossibility of knowing them both, not even in principle.

05:42.160 --> 05:49.930
Note that because the position of A and the momentum of B have been inferred mentally by deduction,

05:50.320 --> 05:58.570
not from a measurement, the implication is that if nature nevertheless maintains Heisenberg's principle

05:58.600 --> 06:06.760
as valid, the uncertainty cannot arise due to the perturbation or disturbance of the system for the

06:06.760 --> 06:14.380
simple reason that no measurement of P on A minus X on B has occurred in the first place.

06:15.790 --> 06:23.110
This also means that if the particles, positions and momentum are really definite, as Epper argue,

06:24.010 --> 06:31.300
then the wave function and all the other Jabri construct describing a quantum system, lack of the complete

06:31.300 --> 06:38.740
information since it allows only for one or the other dynamic variable to be to be determined according

06:38.740 --> 06:42.340
to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and the commutation relations.

06:43.630 --> 06:54.550
So by this simple reasoning, EPR concluded as follows, if without any way disturbing a system, we

06:54.550 --> 07:02.560
can predict with certainty that is with probability equal to unity, the value of a of a physical quantity,

07:03.130 --> 07:08.740
then there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.

07:10.500 --> 07:18.360
Later on, they also write, while we have thus shown that the wavefunction does not provide a complete

07:18.360 --> 07:24.960
description of the physical reality, we left open the question of whether or not such a description

07:24.960 --> 07:25.710
exists.

07:26.310 --> 07:30.800
We believe, however, that such a theory is possible.

07:32.640 --> 07:42.120
We can sum this up by stating also the following is the condition for the reality of a physical quantity

07:42.120 --> 07:48.020
is the possibility of predicting it with certainty without disturbing the system.

07:49.050 --> 07:56.400
Then first, the description of reality given, by the way, function in quantum mechanics is not complete.

07:57.920 --> 08:06.860
Or second, second possibility, these two quantities, X and P, cannot have simultaneous reality.

08:08.410 --> 08:17.350
This is known as the EPR paradox, the paradox is not in the logic or the math, but in what this logic

08:17.800 --> 08:18.600
suggests.

08:18.610 --> 08:26.440
In contrast to our physical, macroscopic, everyday experience, nature seems to opt for the second

08:26.440 --> 08:34.240
possibility, with quantum mechanics complete, contrary to any form of realism to which we are accustomed.

08:35.500 --> 08:43.240
Moreover, Epper argued that if quantum mechanics is a complete theory, this must imply a causality

08:43.240 --> 08:50.650
violation in the relativistic sense, there can be causes and effects which arise apparently due to

08:50.650 --> 08:53.290
an interaction faster than the speed of light.

08:54.330 --> 09:03.030
This is because if one measures the position of a particle A and by doing so discovers that this instantly

09:03.030 --> 09:10.740
causes an uncertainty over the momentum of Particle B as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle requests.

09:12.180 --> 09:20.040
Even if it is light years away, then this looks like an interaction at a distance that is aluminum

09:20.550 --> 09:25.560
in the same manner we already saw in the previous section with quantum entanglement.

09:28.750 --> 09:36.940
Because relativity was already an experimental test in accepted theory, in EPA's view, therefore,

09:36.940 --> 09:39.850
quantum mechanics had to be modified.

09:40.930 --> 09:45.940
It could at best be considered only a provisional theory and not a complete theory.

09:46.980 --> 09:54.060
This because if quantum mechanics imposes the noncommitted ability of operators as a fundamental principle,

09:54.990 --> 10:02.040
a thought experiment like that which are proposed should not be allowed to circumvent it.

10:03.590 --> 10:11.570
What Epper were looking for was a local theory that is a theory that does not need apparently instant

10:11.590 --> 10:19.730
super luminal correlations over long distances and that does not deal with intrinsically undetermined

10:19.850 --> 10:20.530
states.

10:21.440 --> 10:28.070
They were looking for a theory which would reveal how quantum mechanics in its present form must be

10:28.070 --> 10:34.880
incomplete and which ultimately explained facts in terms of predetermined and well-defined states,

10:35.120 --> 10:42.710
as in Newtonian mechanics or relativity, and which rested on the assumption that hidden variables exists

10:43.010 --> 10:47.770
that rule the phenomenon, even if they have yet to be found.

10:49.180 --> 10:55.510
In this thought experiment, the predetermination they were seeking was some mechanism, some still

10:55.510 --> 11:03.000
unknown process, which poses the two particles into an opposite spin state at the time of their creation

11:03.520 --> 11:04.840
already at the source.

11:05.710 --> 11:11.860
And that could dispense with the requirement of any annoying faster than light correlation.

11:13.390 --> 11:19.780
EPA were apparently able to show that the principle of complementarity expressed by computational relations

11:19.780 --> 11:27.010
seems to be a form of mathematical abstraction, but cannot describe how things are really objectively

11:27.040 --> 11:28.650
out there, so to speak.

11:30.070 --> 11:37.810
Physical objects must ultimately have intrinsically definite properties, even if, for whatever reason,

11:37.810 --> 11:39.610
we can't measure them directly.

11:40.370 --> 11:50.440
That is, EPR tried hard to reintroduce counterfactual definiteness into the physical picture in the

11:50.670 --> 11:52.570
EPR thought experiment.

11:52.720 --> 12:00.400
One deduces properties such as the position of particle B in the momentum of particle A, not measuring

12:00.400 --> 12:09.160
it by a retroactive reasoning that assumes more or less implicitly, that particles inherently have

12:09.160 --> 12:13.090
a position and momentum even if we are not able to know them.

12:14.520 --> 12:18.790
Quantum mechanics, however, seems to shed serious doubt on that.

12:19.110 --> 12:23.900
The question at this point is where Epper really right?

12:25.370 --> 12:28.720
Is quantum mechanics an incomplete theory, after all?

12:29.680 --> 12:36.250
Where are they finally successful in finding a loophole in quantum mechanics that shows its incompleteness?

12:37.350 --> 12:45.360
We will answer these questions, however, before let us also review the EPR thought experiment itself

12:45.360 --> 12:52.440
in its modern version, since this is the experimental setup that nowadays physicists work with.
