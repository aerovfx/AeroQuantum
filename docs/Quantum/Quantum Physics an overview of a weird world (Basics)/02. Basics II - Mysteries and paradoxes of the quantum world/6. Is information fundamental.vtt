00:00.360 --> 00:10.290
The usefulness of the STEM Galla devices does not stop here as an appendix, so to speak, to the previous

00:10.290 --> 00:17.220
section, we will focus on an experiment, the so-called modified Stanzler experiment.

00:17.760 --> 00:27.150
Also briefly shortly, S.G. Experiment, which digs deeper into what we call the quantum ontology.

00:27.720 --> 00:36.600
This experimental setup was not conceived by Stern and Gowalla, but about 30 years later, in 1951

00:36.870 --> 00:45.510
by David Boehme, it is powerful, the tactical tool that better highlights some quantum phenomena but

00:45.510 --> 00:55.140
is unfortunately explained only rarely in physics undergraduate studies which go directly into the algebra

00:55.140 --> 01:01.080
without establishing a deeper understanding of its meaning and where it comes from.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.380
The basic building block of an MSgt.

01:08.630 --> 01:16.820
Can be realized with an apparatus, as in this figure here, here one uses three magnets, the first

01:17.000 --> 01:27.710
separates the particle beam, as usual, into its spin components, say here the x axis spin, where

01:27.710 --> 01:40.250
the particle with X Kate plus spin will follow the upper path, while those those with X in minus spin

01:40.250 --> 01:42.410
state will follow the lower one.

01:43.930 --> 01:55.360
Then a second longer magnet with opposite polarity manages to reverse that the Asian path, finally,

01:55.360 --> 02:04.450
the third magnet stops the trajectories from diverging and merges the two beams into one single output,

02:04.810 --> 02:06.790
making them indistinguishable.

02:08.190 --> 02:17.070
Now, let us repeat the same experiment as in the measurement deals of the previous section of the previous

02:17.070 --> 02:25.290
lecture about the computational relations I depicted here, it here again in a corner for your convenience,

02:26.280 --> 02:32.310
but this time with the MSG instead of the SGX.

02:33.030 --> 02:39.870
That is the experimental situation we have in measurement e of this experimental set up.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.570
The particle, the particles in the.

02:44.920 --> 02:56.290
Said Kate Plus State are selected first and go through the Mawji, which deviates it up or down according

02:56.290 --> 03:00.410
to its plus or minus spin state.

03:01.630 --> 03:09.550
In fact, it physically performs internally the same measure as in the measurement D, but it hides

03:09.580 --> 03:17.320
the result to an outside observer by reuniting the two beams at its output.

03:18.840 --> 03:28.260
At this point, the question is, what will the last as that stage measure, that which repeats that

03:28.260 --> 03:29.580
that spin measure?

03:30.990 --> 03:37.640
We might be tempted to say that there is no reason to believe that a different result than in measurement

03:37.920 --> 03:47.490
emerges as the MSG device performs an interaction free measurement along the X axis and should not change

03:47.490 --> 03:50.130
anything along that axis.

03:51.770 --> 03:57.950
Compared to measurement, I mean, because, of course, it changes something because the connotation

03:57.950 --> 04:01.220
relations hold, but compared to the it should be the same.

04:02.110 --> 04:08.590
Moreover, according to our classical logic and understanding of the world, what we know about what

04:08.590 --> 04:13.960
happens internally to the MSG is irrelevant measurement.

04:13.960 --> 04:22.300
It could be considered equivalent to measurement because we might believe that inserting the MSG simply

04:22.300 --> 04:27.190
does nothing if it is perfect and ideal measurement device that does not disturb the system.

04:27.760 --> 04:36.820
And we would expect, again, a 50/50 chance of getting that spin up or spin down along the Z axis.

04:38.770 --> 04:48.370
Nature's answer, however, is that of measurement, it is not equivalent to measurement, the better

04:48.400 --> 04:49.120
measurement be.

04:50.670 --> 04:54.480
Which is, again, depicted in the lower right for your convenience.

04:55.650 --> 05:00.480
Indeed, the particles all remain remain unaffected in the.

05:01.440 --> 05:08.410
That Kate Plus I can state and remain as they are at the entrance of the whole device.

05:09.870 --> 05:19.440
This is despite the fact that inside the SGX that is hidden from our side, a sort of measurement along

05:19.440 --> 05:28.380
the x axis is done just as in measurement D with the only difference being that the information it is

05:28.380 --> 05:33.330
supposed to hold is erased at the exit of the MSG.

05:35.110 --> 05:45.610
Once this cascading of S.G. and MSJ devices is put in place, it does not alter the initial state that

05:45.610 --> 05:51.700
Kate plus of the particle apparently in complete contradiction to what we got a measurement de.

05:53.890 --> 05:58.100
So what does all this tell us?

05:59.230 --> 06:04.060
There are different ways in which one can describe it using human language.

06:06.070 --> 06:13.600
One way to explain the reality that emerges from this is to state that we perform a spin measurement

06:13.600 --> 06:22.360
on a particle along its x axis and accordingly, accordingly make it travel along the upper or lower

06:22.750 --> 06:24.700
path inside the MSG.

06:25.600 --> 06:35.680
However, by merging the two particle paths into one, we erase the data which way information the particle

06:36.580 --> 06:37.180
followed.

06:38.110 --> 06:44.590
It is a sort of blind measurement in the sense that physically the measurement is performed, but one

06:44.590 --> 06:49.090
does not look at the result and quickly erases the information.

06:50.270 --> 06:57.320
Strictly speaking, it shouldn't even be called a measurement, because by definition, this word implies

06:57.320 --> 07:05.990
a readout of information is separately that for a long time has not been taken seriously and has therefore

07:05.990 --> 07:11.260
led to countless misinterpretation and endless confusion to the present day.

07:12.350 --> 07:14.120
And we will see this again later.

07:15.680 --> 07:23.450
In fact, this was one of the first examples of so-called quantum eraser devices, which we shall see

07:23.450 --> 07:25.940
again later in its modern formats.

07:26.840 --> 07:35.330
The MSgt experiment, therefore, seems to suggest that what really counts is the information we have

07:35.330 --> 07:36.590
about the particles.

07:37.910 --> 07:45.410
That is also why most physicists tend to believe that the wavefunction represents solely pure information

07:45.950 --> 07:51.350
and not a physical entity in nature out there, so to speak.

07:53.120 --> 08:00.800
This sounds quite mind boggling because like the wavefunction, the very concept of information is hard

08:00.800 --> 08:07.730
to imagine as something being out there in the world, as something independent from our abstractions.

08:08.630 --> 08:12.220
We think of information as numbers or mental categories.

08:12.980 --> 08:22.010
But how can it be something concrete like particles, property, or the qualities of macroscopic object,

08:22.040 --> 08:24.530
say a flower or a stone?

08:26.080 --> 08:29.090
Yet in quantum physics, this seems to be the case.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.450
The question is, is it really?

08:34.400 --> 08:41.960
Another way to explain the same observed quantum phenomenon is more abstract, but it conforms more

08:41.990 --> 08:42.740
to the truth.

08:44.390 --> 08:55.100
The idea of a quantum particle following distinct paths here inside an MSG device is a common fallacy

08:55.100 --> 09:01.850
of the human sense mind, which is accustomed to dividing the macroscopic world into distinct objects

09:01.850 --> 09:10.260
and which infers its past whereabouts by means of the so-called reproductive reasoning.

09:11.420 --> 09:18.530
In fact, we can say that that there is no which way information erasure because there is no distinct

09:18.530 --> 09:23.630
particle following one or the other distinct path in the first place in the first place.

09:24.830 --> 09:32.540
But only something which is in a superposition state of both possibilities and which is described by

09:32.540 --> 09:41.000
all wavefunction or state vector that contains the two potentialities at the same time, and that evolves

09:41.420 --> 09:45.490
evolves in time and space without collapse.

09:47.090 --> 09:51.760
Only when we measure with a detector, it is in quantum mechanics.

09:51.770 --> 10:00.650
This means operate with an operator, the observable on the wave function or state vector by somehow

10:00.650 --> 10:06.980
interacting with and eventually absorbing the particle and obtaining a readout.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.930
That is the eigenvalue.

10:10.950 --> 10:19.710
Only, therefore, when this detector measurement takes place, then does a state projection occur.

10:20.990 --> 10:27.260
It would, however, be incorrect to make any statement about the particles whereabouts before that

10:27.260 --> 10:35.840
projective measurement, because there was no such thing as a particle travelling along the upper or

10:35.840 --> 10:41.510
lower path inside the NSG before information Rasiah in the first place.

10:43.030 --> 10:51.490
The information is not lost by merging the beams, but by detecting or simply blocking them and inducing

10:51.490 --> 10:55.630
a projection to only one of the possible aying states.

10:57.150 --> 11:04.050
We will take this up again later, because it is a subcommittee that will require more clarification

11:04.050 --> 11:10.890
and insight to avoid a very common misunderstanding and one among even experienced experienced physicists.

11:12.660 --> 11:21.930
Meanwhile, note how from this also emerged the fact that the measurement act in itself did not disturb

11:22.020 --> 11:26.460
the system state and the determined and experiment's outcome.

11:27.920 --> 11:35.450
This also is a popular misinterpretation due to Heisenberg's microscope analogy and what we have already

11:35.450 --> 11:39.550
dismissed in the lecture on the Uncertainty Principle.

11:40.850 --> 11:48.440
What ends up leaving that that's been determined or not is the kind of experimental arrangement that

11:48.440 --> 11:53.600
allows for the knowledge about the spin state along the X axis or not.

11:54.080 --> 11:59.120
In other words, quantum mechanics responds to us depending on the context.

12:00.260 --> 12:07.460
One speaks of quantum context, reality, it is called quantum contextual, it is that is that strange

12:07.460 --> 12:15.350
behavior of quantum objects whereby the measurement of a quantum observable depends on the specific

12:15.350 --> 12:22.610
experimental set up, and the answer depends on what we are already allowed to know about it.

12:23.840 --> 12:31.790
The result depends not only on the intrinsic physical properties of a quantum object or system, but

12:31.790 --> 12:36.020
also on the context in which an experiment is done on it.

12:37.580 --> 12:42.110
And we will see that much more about this with follow.
