00:01.020 --> 00:07.080
If you have followed so far, you will probably agree that the picture of the universe that emerges

00:07.080 --> 00:14.280
from quantum physics is really weird, at least from the point of view of our everyday human experience.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.980
Many strange things happen.

00:17.290 --> 00:24.030
We have the wave particle duality whereby before we observe it, particles do not behave as particles

00:24.030 --> 00:25.500
at all, but as waves.

00:25.710 --> 00:31.470
And yet when we measure it, we always get only point like interactions as an answer.

00:32.070 --> 00:38.160
There is the Heisenberg and Time, Energy Uncertainty Principle in which these particles seem to have

00:38.160 --> 00:44.460
intrinsically fuzzy properties in their position, momentum and energy, so that we can no longer conceive

00:44.460 --> 00:51.990
them as objects with definite physical attributes, but only as objects measured out in time and space.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.480
To describe all of this.

00:54.690 --> 01:00.930
Physicists have come up with what they call the wavefunction, which has the annoying properties of

01:00.930 --> 01:08.670
collapsing immediately at the instant when an observation, of course, and when nobody knows for sure

01:09.360 --> 01:17.850
whether it is a thing that has some reality out there or whether it is simply a mathematical abstraction.

01:18.570 --> 01:25.290
We saw then that particles can tunnel through a barrier, even though they do not have the classical

01:25.770 --> 01:28.280
required amount of energy to do so.

01:28.890 --> 01:36.210
Then because of the ground state of energy, of the vacuum, empty space seems to be not so empty after

01:36.210 --> 01:45.030
all, and according to a probably bit too naive interpretation, lots of particles can quickly pop in

01:45.030 --> 01:48.540
and out of existence, so to speak.

01:49.980 --> 01:55.230
Moreover, even in the quantum domain must be described with probabilities because everything is random

01:55.230 --> 01:56.320
and unpredictable.

01:57.330 --> 02:03.480
This is not the case in the sense of classical physics in which the description of unpredictable events

02:03.480 --> 02:10.770
with statistics reflects our ignorance and limitation in computation in quantum mechanics even can occur

02:10.770 --> 02:12.700
entirely without a cause.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.610
It is a cause less real.

02:16.680 --> 02:23.970
How is it possible that the double slit experiment by maintaining exactly the same experimental condition

02:24.090 --> 02:26.930
and eliminating all possible measurement errors.

02:27.090 --> 02:34.950
Nevertheless, one electron hits the screen in one position while another electron will be found in

02:34.950 --> 02:36.840
a completely different position.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.130
How can this be?

02:38.140 --> 02:43.050
This is only the beginning of a long list of weird things in quantum physics.

02:44.310 --> 02:51.030
What emerges from this picture is a reality that looks tremendously counterintuitive to our understanding

02:51.030 --> 02:53.820
of the physical world from childhood.

02:54.060 --> 03:01.290
Our brains have been trained to see and interpret phenomenon in terms of classical mechanics in which

03:01.290 --> 03:07.740
objects have well-defined properties and do not have these ambiguous behaviours that quantum physics

03:07.740 --> 03:08.390
displays.

03:09.360 --> 03:15.600
On the other hand, it is a fact that quantum physics, as it is with this mathematical structure founded

03:15.600 --> 03:24.060
on the notion of the wavefunction or the state vector which delivers probability waves, works exceptionally

03:24.060 --> 03:24.450
well.

03:25.050 --> 03:30.630
It is able to describe the phenomenon from particle to mullock, molecular physics and also beyond.

03:30.810 --> 03:36.660
And it makes precise quantitative predictions where classical physics fails.

03:38.440 --> 03:46.450
Yet while from the mathematical perspective, everything works fine from a more philosophical one which

03:46.450 --> 03:53.020
tries to make sense of all this and wants to satisfy the human thirst to know the deeper meaning and

03:53.020 --> 03:59.080
essence of things, even the brightest minds were not able to find a clear description.

04:00.050 --> 04:08.150
The math works fine, but at the epistemological and ontological level, nobody agrees.

04:09.080 --> 04:15.620
We also will see how a great physicist and genius like Schrodinger was puzzled by the implications of

04:15.620 --> 04:20.700
quantum physics, which led him to propose the famous quantum cat paradox.

04:21.350 --> 04:29.120
However, among the physicists of the time, the one who was most dissatisfied with the state of affairs

04:29.300 --> 04:30.920
was Albert Einstein.

04:32.030 --> 04:36.440
This was because Einstein series or his own theories.

04:36.800 --> 04:44.180
Above all, special and general relativity relied heavily on the opposite world conception in which

04:44.180 --> 04:51.290
the focus is rather a mathematical approach that preserved elements of the classical mechanics of Newton

04:51.290 --> 04:52.040
and Galileo.

04:52.850 --> 04:56.210
In relativity, everything has well-defined properties.

04:56.210 --> 05:03.470
Particles follow precise path, and at least in principle, everything is predictable, deterministic

05:03.830 --> 05:08.780
without statistical considerations, just as in classical physics.

05:09.890 --> 05:14.980
Contrary to quantum physics, relativity is a purely deterministic theory.

05:16.070 --> 05:23.060
That is one of the reasons why relativity is sometimes categorized as still being a classical theory,

05:23.810 --> 05:28.610
though it's superseded Newton and Newtonian Newtonian mechanics.

05:30.230 --> 05:37.430
Moreover, as we will see in the section about quantum entanglement, quantum theory seems to suggest

05:37.430 --> 05:44.180
even faster than light interaction's something which Einstein could certainly not take seriously because

05:44.180 --> 05:47.660
his own theory of relativity strictly forbade it.

05:48.350 --> 05:54.620
His approach to physical reality was so successful that Einstein was not willing to accept that quantum

05:54.620 --> 05:56.330
physics is a complete theory.

05:56.510 --> 06:04.940
Describing a real world, he looked at it as only a provisional model that sooner or later had to be

06:04.940 --> 06:12.470
replaced by a better theory to account for all those strange and counterintuitive facts in this context.

06:12.680 --> 06:20.960
Einstein once formulated his belief that God does not play dice, referring to the mysterious randomness

06:21.290 --> 06:22.410
of quantum physics.

06:23.360 --> 06:32.060
He expressed this in a letter to Born in 1926 when he said Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing,

06:32.450 --> 06:36.800
but an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing.

06:37.370 --> 06:43.580
The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us closer to the secret of the old one.

06:44.190 --> 06:48.890
I, at any rate, am convinced that he is not playing at DICE.

06:50.050 --> 06:59.320
Much later in 1944, Einstein returned back to this point, still writing to Born, and he said, We

06:59.320 --> 07:03.450
have become antipodean in our scientific expectations.

07:04.120 --> 07:13.030
You believe in the God who plays dice and I incomplete law and order in a world which objectively exists

07:13.180 --> 07:17.910
and which I in a wildly speculative way and trying to capture.

07:18.970 --> 07:20.110
I firmly believe.

07:20.110 --> 07:28.030
But I hope that someone will discover a more realistic way or rather a more tangible basis than it has

07:28.030 --> 07:37.330
been my lot to find even the great initial success of the quantum theory theory does not make me believe

07:37.330 --> 07:45.280
in the fundamental dice game, although I am well aware that our younger colleagues interpret this as

07:45.280 --> 07:47.350
a consequence of senility.

07:48.430 --> 07:55.810
No doubt the day will come when we will see whose instinctive attitude was the correct one.

07:57.000 --> 08:06.690
On the other side of the front was Niels Bohr, not born Baw Baw, Lightbourne was more prone to accepting

08:06.690 --> 08:10.110
the strange reality that quantum physics suggests.

08:10.770 --> 08:15.490
This is not surprising because he had a rather different professional experience.

08:16.080 --> 08:24.090
His theory of the atom structure was not as successful as Einstein's relativity and was quickly replaced

08:24.090 --> 08:26.550
by the quantum mechanical picture itself.

08:27.810 --> 08:34.380
But success relied more on discoveries which had their roots in quantum physics rather than in classical

08:34.380 --> 08:34.980
mechanics.

08:36.060 --> 08:42.780
Therefore, while Einstein was puzzling on the nature and essence of quantum physics, both took a more

08:42.780 --> 08:45.030
pragmatic view of the whole problem.

08:45.870 --> 08:52.560
For him, it was easier to embrace quantum physics, as a matter of fact, that we should accept, as

08:52.560 --> 09:02.070
it is from these two diverging point of view, emerged a debate over the conceptual foundations of quantum

09:02.070 --> 09:11.430
physics, which nowadays is known as Bhau Einstein debate and which took place from about the 1930s

09:11.430 --> 09:13.950
until the end of World War Two.

09:16.150 --> 09:23.710
I understand the approach was to look at loopholes in the theory, some aspects in the current foundations,

09:23.980 --> 09:29.830
which must lead to a contradiction to some form of contradictions or inconsistencies.

09:30.760 --> 09:37.480
He thought that such flaws could finally vindicate the classical understanding of physical reality because

09:37.480 --> 09:45.130
he found it unacceptable to consider a theory that displays such fuzzy and undetermined Rehame as quantum

09:45.130 --> 09:53.530
physics that therefore he tried hard to find some way out, something that would show us that this theory

09:53.530 --> 10:00.580
is incomplete and requires further improvement and development by incomplete.

10:00.850 --> 10:09.910
It is meant that the theory must have hidden variables which assume that the quantum events are caused

10:09.910 --> 10:15.460
by something we haven't yet discovered and which would explain the fuzziness.

10:15.760 --> 10:22.120
This fuzziness and uncertainty and apparent are causality of quantum mechanics.

10:23.310 --> 10:31.050
Einstein and other physicists hope to explain quantum indeterminism and where it appears by resorting

10:31.050 --> 10:38.100
to a deterministic conception of reality, just like the theory of gases, for example, in thermodynamics,

10:38.340 --> 10:47.340
explain the molecular chaos of molecules and atoms with the Brownian motion that is with the exception

10:47.340 --> 10:49.800
of molecules due to thermal effects.

10:50.370 --> 10:58.080
Analogously, a future refined quantum theory should explain its indeterminacy as a superficial manifestation

10:58.080 --> 11:05.250
of hidden components, or at least more general unknown, unknown variables, which in the current,

11:05.250 --> 11:09.850
supposedly incomplete form of the theory are still not evident.

11:10.680 --> 11:17.430
In fact, it is difficult to escape the impression that in a world where things happen only by chance,

11:17.700 --> 11:25.770
just out of the blue, so to speak, apparently with no causal relation, we are eventually missing

11:25.770 --> 11:26.340
something.

11:27.330 --> 11:32.510
The very principle of cause and effect seems to no longer work here.

11:33.540 --> 11:41.220
Is there perhaps something we still don't know, some hidden variables in the theory we don't see that

11:41.220 --> 11:50.130
once found will explain all this reality that is so alien to our daily common sense by returning to

11:50.130 --> 11:53.880
our good old Newtonian and deterministic understanding.

11:55.380 --> 12:02.130
Bore instead argued that there are no hidden variables, quantum mechanics is a complete theory, and

12:02.130 --> 12:07.070
we should accept it as it is because after all, it works well.

12:07.470 --> 12:13.950
It is mathematically consistent and it furnishes the quantitate quantitative predictions we need.

12:14.670 --> 12:18.050
And this is precisely what science should be about.

12:18.810 --> 12:25.330
The rest is philosophy that should not bother physicists for the rest of his life.

12:25.350 --> 12:30.650
Einstein tried to reconcile quantum mechanics with a deterministic understanding of the world.

12:31.500 --> 12:39.450
He published articles in which he proposed interesting and very smart experiments to show why quantum

12:39.450 --> 12:42.040
mechanics couldn't be a complete theory.

12:43.320 --> 12:51.480
The most famous one was written with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen and is illustrated in the so-called

12:51.480 --> 12:54.900
EPR paradox that we will discuss later.

12:55.710 --> 13:03.450
On his side, Bhau answered Einstein's attacks on the foundations of quantum theory with other articles

13:03.450 --> 13:06.930
in which he showed Einstein's fallacious thinking.

13:07.830 --> 13:14.900
It was an historical and very interesting battle between two titans of science, so to speak.

13:16.340 --> 13:24.020
To provide an example of how this debate developed, it might be interesting to look at how Einstein

13:24.020 --> 13:30.440
argued and Baugh answered with one of the experiments that Einstein proposed.

13:32.070 --> 13:37.730
For instance, Einstein proposed a thought experiment to suggest that quantum mechanics cannot be a

13:37.730 --> 13:40.220
complete theory for the following reasons.

13:41.750 --> 13:48.460
Let us send a single particle through a single slit device as shown in this figure here.

13:49.460 --> 13:53.180
In truth, Einstein argued initially with the double slit.

13:53.180 --> 14:00.230
But for the sake of simplicity, let us illustrate his ideas in a manner that Bore summed up later.

14:01.930 --> 14:10.390
This singers lit hangs at the spring as depicted in the figure and which, by the way, bore himself

14:10.420 --> 14:13.890
through, not how he edits the screws.

14:14.350 --> 14:17.590
And this might say a lot about Paul's personality.

14:19.300 --> 14:23.370
As we know, when the particles pass, this passes as lit.

14:23.830 --> 14:30.820
It will statistically suffer a deflection from the straight incoming direction line, according to Heisenberg's

14:30.820 --> 14:36.770
Uncertainty Principle, or equivalently, if you prefer, because of the wave particle duality.

14:37.900 --> 14:47.170
However, if we maintain that the conservation of momentum is a universally true law, this deflection

14:47.170 --> 14:55.740
of the particle by the lit must also cause a more recoil of the slit itself in the opposite direction.

14:57.170 --> 15:03.920
And we should be able to measure this record by observing houses lit, which is directly attached to

15:03.920 --> 15:12.080
the spring, must move and eventually cause an oscillatory movement of the spring and the slit structure.

15:13.920 --> 15:20.610
It is the particle is deflected upwards, the slit will suffer a recoil downwards.

15:21.780 --> 15:28.350
On the other hand, if the particle is deflected downwards, the slit will suffer a recoil upwards.

15:30.420 --> 15:36.030
Once detected on the other side of the device, we know how large this deflection was.

15:36.750 --> 15:42.210
This means that at least in principle, one should be able to trace back the position of the particle

15:42.210 --> 15:49.740
when it first was lit, the position of the bullet itself and also its momentum at the same time by

15:49.740 --> 15:51.660
observing the recoil.

15:52.670 --> 15:59.720
However, this is contrary to all that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states, which excludes the

15:59.720 --> 16:06.280
notion that we can know the position and momentum of a particle at the same time, even in principle,

16:07.100 --> 16:10.830
this is, of course, only an ideal representation of the experiment.

16:11.000 --> 16:17.420
It would be difficult to build such a device for tiny elementary particles as we would need a perfectly

16:17.420 --> 16:23.030
friction free slit and a system which is microscopic compared to the particles.

16:23.960 --> 16:30.360
Extremely precise measurement devices would be necessary to detect any motion produced in it.

16:31.460 --> 16:38.740
That is the reason why they are called thought experiments from the German Gattung, an experiment and

16:38.930 --> 16:45.340
they cannot be realized practically but are nevertheless logically and physically consistent.

16:46.610 --> 16:53.210
This kind of thought experiment was for Einstein, a perfectly legitimate experimental arrangement that

16:53.210 --> 16:59.690
contradicts the conventional interpretation of quantum mechanics, at least Heisenberg's uncertainty

16:59.690 --> 17:09.140
principle, which for this reason must be considered not as fundamental, but a manifestation of a deeper,

17:09.140 --> 17:15.890
hidden variable theory, which in turn means that quantum physics must be considered incomplete.

17:17.150 --> 17:25.400
This was how Einstein's argument went, an argument that seemed quite convincing to Einstein, who certainly

17:25.610 --> 17:27.770
was a very smart guy.

17:29.540 --> 17:34.670
However, Bor was a smart guy, too, and he disagreed.

17:35.420 --> 17:43.670
In fact, he showed that Einstein forgot something very important in this picture, that the uncertainty

17:43.670 --> 17:48.140
of the position of the zealot itself must be taken into account.

17:49.430 --> 17:53.960
Also for the split structure as a whole, despite its being.

17:55.090 --> 18:00.160
A macroscopic object, we must apply the uncertainty principle.

18:01.480 --> 18:09.010
The point is the tiny recoil of the slit, say, caused by an electron, for instance, would be so

18:09.010 --> 18:13.840
extremely small that we must use the rules of quantum physics to determine it.

18:15.340 --> 18:22.800
In his response to Einstein, Bore showed that if we also take into account Heisenberg's uncertainty

18:22.810 --> 18:31.040
relations for the slit, we must also conceive of its position as slightly but not negligible.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.560
Negligibly uncertain.

18:33.550 --> 18:40.890
The oscillations of the slit would be so small its position and momentum shifts due to the electrons

18:40.900 --> 18:48.430
recall would be of the same order of magnitude as the position and momentum and certainty of the particles

18:48.610 --> 18:50.890
that traverse the slit itself.

18:52.440 --> 18:59.580
This uncertainty over the position itself is just that uncertainty that will remove the information

18:59.760 --> 19:09.240
about the magnitude of this, let's recall, and ultimately render Einsteins thought experiment useless

19:09.420 --> 19:11.910
in determining the particles momentum.

19:13.390 --> 19:21.190
Therefore, Einstein thought experiment relied on a fallacious thought, it will not allow us to determine

19:21.190 --> 19:27.760
at the same time the position of momentum of particles, not even in principle, and he could no longer

19:27.760 --> 19:35.590
state that this kind of reasoning leads to any demonstration of the incompleteness of quantum mechanics.

19:37.240 --> 19:44.440
In essence, what Einstein seemed to have forgotten was that there is no reason to believe that Heisenberg's

19:44.440 --> 19:51.880
uncertainty principle no longer holds for macroscopic objects, the uncertainty relations always hold

19:51.880 --> 19:59.970
for any microscopic particle, to any macroscopic object, even for things, for things as big as black

19:59.970 --> 20:00.640
as a planet.

20:01.910 --> 20:08.480
But at the scales of a planet or a microscopic object, the quantum effects are so extremely small and

20:08.480 --> 20:12.630
undetectable that there is no need to take them into account.

20:13.970 --> 20:20.510
Already, the quantum uncertainty on position and momentum for a tiny object like a grain of sand is

20:20.510 --> 20:27.260
far beyond any possibility of detection, even for our most advanced measurement apparatus.

20:28.310 --> 20:38.330
In the context of macroscopic objects like our human body or also a grain of sand, we can simply forget

20:38.840 --> 20:41.910
about it, about the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

20:42.200 --> 20:50.570
Not so, however, for thought experiments like that with the recoiling slit, it might help young students,

20:50.990 --> 20:57.800
those who are struggling to learn the basics of physics, to keep in mind that great scientists like

20:57.800 --> 21:02.470
Einstein also made quite blatant errors.

21:03.530 --> 21:11.660
This was one of the most famous examples illustrating the Boer Einstein debate, Bohr and Einstein engaged

21:11.660 --> 21:18.680
each other in a friendly way as gentlemens with respect and mutual admiration.

21:19.280 --> 21:28.740
Regretfully, something one rarely sees nowadays, but defended their own views with papers and articles.

21:29.630 --> 21:37.340
Einstein refused until the last of his days to give up a classical understanding of the world will see

21:37.340 --> 21:45.740
how modern experiments which were performed after Einstein and Borse death clearly indicate that a deterministic

21:45.770 --> 21:54.680
local hidden variable theory is no longer tenable, at least not in a locally realistic form that Einstein

21:54.710 --> 21:55.970
would have desired.

21:57.490 --> 22:04.270
On the other hand, we might also question whether a more pragmatic approach is the final answer to

22:04.270 --> 22:11.560
quantum physics, both approach was more at ease in this intellectual challenge.

22:12.040 --> 22:18.280
While Einstein had to think of more or less complicated, complicated thought experiments trying to

22:18.280 --> 22:27.910
falsify the current conceptions or essentially had to do nothing except reply to reply to Einstein attacks

22:28.000 --> 22:29.890
and defend the status quo.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.370
Borse attitude towards Einstein.

22:33.400 --> 22:41.770
Einstein doubts and his interpretation of quantum physics is nowadays summed up in the so-called Kopenhagen

22:41.770 --> 22:50.740
interpretation of quantum mechanics and interpretation, which is since then was adopted by almost the

22:50.740 --> 22:54.460
entire community of physicists for a long time to come.

22:55.750 --> 23:03.220
It was considered the final nail in the coffin on the subject and is still considered as such by many

23:03.220 --> 23:04.700
physicists as a present day.

23:06.070 --> 23:14.140
However, in the last three decades, thanks to new technology, technological advances that allow us

23:14.140 --> 23:21.760
to perform experiments previously impossible to perform, and due to the well funded research which

23:21.760 --> 23:29.650
attempts to build quantum computers, the debate has returned to the stage and continues to occupy several

23:29.650 --> 23:32.690
philosophers of science and also some physicists.

23:33.610 --> 23:39.810
We will go deeper into this subject in the following lectures.

23:40.240 --> 23:46.750
However, it is important to know what essentially the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics

23:46.750 --> 23:54.130
is about so that we have an idea and perception of the kinds of philosophical and ideological backgrounds

23:54.280 --> 23:57.040
that influence quantum physics to this day.

23:58.060 --> 24:04.540
In reality, the Copenhagen interpretation is not an official declaration that was announced by someone

24:04.540 --> 24:14.380
or during a Congress, it is sometimes somewhat incorrectly associated with a standpoint that supposedly

24:14.380 --> 24:21.610
physicists adopted during the fifth SOLWAY International Conference on Electron Electrons and Photons

24:21.610 --> 24:24.910
in Brasso in 1927.

24:25.750 --> 24:33.970
In this meeting, the most prominent figures of the time convened, such as Einstein, Madame Curie,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.280
Heisenberg, Schrodinger and so on.

24:37.540 --> 24:43.870
However, there is no official statement that emerged from that conference, at least not about the

24:43.870 --> 24:45.700
interpretations of quantum mechanics.

24:46.630 --> 24:56.950
Therefore, the Copenhagen interpretation began to arise during the late 1920s and early 1930s and is

24:56.950 --> 25:04.540
more associated with the figure of Bohr, who was a professor at the university in Copenhagen in Denmark.

25:06.220 --> 25:12.910
There is no piece of paper or historical act that clearly defines this interpretation.

25:14.020 --> 25:22.600
It loosely expresses an understanding and interpretation of of things and a spirit of the of the time,

25:22.610 --> 25:23.500
so to speak.

25:24.910 --> 25:25.780
That is why.

25:27.370 --> 25:35.290
I feel authorized to express it in my own words, even though there are several other ways to express

25:35.290 --> 25:35.880
it as well.

25:35.890 --> 25:42.790
Of course, one way to stay, the Copenhagen interpretation is simply to say that quantum mechanics

25:42.790 --> 25:45.130
is about measurement outcomes.

25:45.280 --> 25:49.480
We should not attempt to infer objective realities from it.

25:50.630 --> 25:55.410
This is a strictly pragmatic and utilitarian approach.

25:56.210 --> 26:02.780
Stop thinking about the deeper philosophical issues to your calculations, see if they fit with the

26:02.780 --> 26:06.840
experiments and be happy with that, especially if they do fit.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.430
In fact, this approach has its logic.

26:11.510 --> 26:19.310
After all, the human mind and the human and scientific mind is one of the senses, a mind which evaluates

26:19.430 --> 26:26.000
in fears and extrapolates and interpretation of the world from empirical data, which, however, can

26:26.000 --> 26:30.800
lead to different models and interpretation interpretations of what is seen.

26:31.950 --> 26:38.160
Think, for example, of the Gestalt figures, you might see two faces or a.

26:39.880 --> 26:46.390
But the figure remains remains the same, you know, this kind of figure that when you look at it first,

26:46.390 --> 26:51.310
you see two faces or the moment later you see a vais.

26:52.450 --> 26:59.650
So in this view, it is dangerous to make these extrapolations according to the Copenhagen interpretation,

26:59.650 --> 27:02.950
which must stop there at least as physicists.

27:04.720 --> 27:11.200
Another typical statement that could be ascribed to the Copenhagen interpretation is of the kind that

27:11.200 --> 27:19.270
wavefunction is only a mathematical abstraction which furnishes probabilities that a specific event

27:19.270 --> 27:23.110
or cause this is not a real physical object.

27:24.800 --> 27:32.060
This, again, is a mathematical, pragmatic approach, simply do your calculations with wavefunction,

27:32.690 --> 27:37.010
but do not attempt to infer from that a deeper ontology of things.

27:37.410 --> 27:44.840
That is the nature of how things are, in reality, independent from what we perceive.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.950
After all, what is reality?

27:48.710 --> 27:55.940
What follows from that is also that according to the Copenhagen interpretation, there is no such thing

27:55.970 --> 27:57.620
as a wavefunction collapse.

27:58.850 --> 28:04.670
This should be considered only a mathematical update of the information we have about the state of the

28:04.670 --> 28:05.210
system.

28:06.390 --> 28:12.370
What collapses is the lack of information about the system state before the measurement.

28:12.390 --> 28:18.520
We don't know while after the measurement, we know something more about the state of a particle system.

28:19.860 --> 28:28.190
So in this view, it is quite natural, a natural thing, and that a collapse seems to occur.

28:28.470 --> 28:35.400
It is just an abstract, formal act of encoding information from one instant before the measurement

28:35.520 --> 28:37.180
to that after the measurement.

28:37.770 --> 28:44.190
The problem is solved because according to this standpoint, no problem exists in the first place.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.960
Yet another statement of the same point of view.

28:49.070 --> 28:56.450
The wavefunction describes the state of a system and is all that can be known about the way function

28:56.450 --> 29:04.550
is, all that can be said, it is futile to ascribe a deeper meaning and reality to it just just as

29:04.550 --> 29:07.900
it is futile to attempt to get more out of it.

29:09.340 --> 29:18.220
Finally comes the question of why then this discrepancy exists between the physics we observe in the

29:18.220 --> 29:21.000
microscopic versus the microscopic.

29:22.390 --> 29:28.270
Why do we see things so differently in the classical world as compared to the quantum one?

29:29.500 --> 29:37.870
The Copenhagen interpretation answers with a well-known Bors correspondence principle, which can be

29:37.870 --> 29:45.280
summed up by saying that a large collection of quantum particles will exhibit classical behavior with

29:45.280 --> 29:53.650
a growing number as a number of particles grows even if they have very different properties and states.

29:54.220 --> 30:01.780
These properties average out when a certain quantity of particles is present, and just that average

30:01.780 --> 30:08.230
emerges on the macroscopic scale, defining the qualities of the world we know.

30:09.120 --> 30:15.360
In other words, according to those who embrace the Copenhagen interpretation, there isn't much to

30:15.360 --> 30:23.880
understand and investigate in terms of the deeper meaning of things, simply let us accept what we observe

30:24.120 --> 30:26.790
and posit it as a principle.

30:28.070 --> 30:29.150
In the first place.

30:30.560 --> 30:37.940
The scientific utilitarianism, which is especially incarnated in the Copenhagen interpretation, might

30:37.940 --> 30:45.410
sound a bit dry and not really satisfying for those inclined towards a deeper understanding of things

30:46.160 --> 30:51.200
and inclination that seeks to find the the the ultimate realities.

30:52.130 --> 30:57.560
However, it is a fact that it worked well for several generations of physicists.

30:58.400 --> 31:05.300
This pragmatic approach gave us the modern standard model of particle physics, which was one of the

31:05.300 --> 31:10.560
most successful theories, not only physics, but of perhaps all science.

31:11.630 --> 31:19.850
It also gave us the modern theories of particle astrophysics and cosmology, as well as allowed us to

31:19.850 --> 31:26.990
build many devices, especially in the electronics branch and in information technologies, computers

31:26.990 --> 31:27.560
and so on.

31:28.310 --> 31:35.810
Therefore, contrary to popular belief for a long time, apart from rare exceptions, physicists no

31:35.810 --> 31:42.950
longer worked on the conceptual foundations of quantum physics but were busy developed, developing

31:42.950 --> 31:51.170
quite complicated mathematical and abstract theories that allowed them to make calculations, predicting

31:51.410 --> 31:54.780
the empiric data not much more.

31:55.640 --> 32:03.260
Even today, most are not working on it, as it is highly unlikely that they will find a job and make

32:03.260 --> 32:04.130
money from this.

32:05.390 --> 32:14.000
And now quite famous sentence with which David Mermin, a physics professor at Cornell University,

32:14.000 --> 32:23.540
summed up the Copenhagen interpretation and its attitude towards foundational IS issues is simply saying

32:23.930 --> 32:25.640
shut up and calculate.

32:26.610 --> 32:35.610
This is how physicists work nowadays, not all, but most, and how physics was and still largely is

32:35.940 --> 32:42.200
taught in universities and regretfully in schools as well.

32:43.200 --> 32:50.850
Do not ask questions, just do your exercise and your homework, which are complicated and time consuming

32:50.850 --> 32:57.510
enough and which leave almost no time and psychological energy to do anything else.

32:58.770 --> 33:07.800
No wonder that in a world so profoundly conditioned by science and technology, the younger generations

33:07.800 --> 33:12.390
are less inclined to apply for studies and jobs that require technical skills.

33:13.920 --> 33:21.630
However, while the human spirit of inquiry can fall asleep for some time and on some occasions for

33:21.630 --> 33:25.490
a very long time, it cannot be suffocated forever.

33:26.400 --> 33:36.690
As we will see in the late 1960s, Sir John Stewart Bell and Northern Irish physicist came along with

33:36.870 --> 33:44.910
very interesting considerations that reopened the gates to new speculation's and new thought experiments,

33:45.390 --> 33:50.010
which could historically be considered a continuation of the Boer Einstein debate.
