00:00.180 --> 00:08.640
Let us focus now on another very important concept of quantum physics, which is the so-called quantum

00:08.640 --> 00:10.270
superposition principle.

00:11.250 --> 00:18.330
It is a very interesting but also weird aspect of quantum reality, which has been discussed by scientists

00:18.330 --> 00:26.160
and philosophers throughout the 20th century and still remains a deeply counterintuitive property of

00:26.160 --> 00:29.160
particles at not only particles.

00:30.570 --> 00:36.890
So let us see what it is all about by looking back briefly again to the good old Dubbo's little experiment.

00:37.800 --> 00:46.050
You recall how on that occasion we conceived of an experiment where we could use only one particle at

00:46.050 --> 00:53.010
a time, say, a single electron at a time, which we sent through the double towards the screen.

00:54.610 --> 01:04.240
It is hard enough to imagine a single particle distracting and interfering with itself, but if we stick

01:04.240 --> 01:08.230
with this picture, we must give up the logical or reasoning.

01:09.280 --> 01:17.290
We must think of the particle going through this little one and lead to something that in classical

01:17.290 --> 01:23.490
physics as well as classical logic, would be mutually exclusive.

01:25.110 --> 01:34.500
As weird as this may appear, experimental facts show that our intuitive understanding, which presupposes

01:34.500 --> 01:43.800
an interpretation based on a logical, disjunctive or would be in contradiction with the observed interference

01:43.800 --> 01:44.300
phenomena.

01:46.440 --> 01:53.400
Since this state of affairs sounds counter to intuitive and the model of a single particle becoming,

01:54.000 --> 02:03.090
so to speak, ubiquitous and going through to or eventually also Maunsell, it is a quite doubtful.

02:03.990 --> 02:12.120
One physicist refrain from trying to imagine any model and ontology at all, one then simply says that

02:12.120 --> 02:20.850
the state of the particle, as long as there is no measurement, is undetermined, uncertain or simply

02:20.850 --> 02:21.840
undefined.

02:24.830 --> 02:33.050
We encountered a similar situation with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which we visualized with

02:33.050 --> 02:39.950
the with the help of a single bullet or the pinhole experiment and which is summarized again here,

02:40.640 --> 02:48.200
you should know now at is not what we observe on the screen is the distribution of points of pride,

02:48.200 --> 02:55.850
tiny spots on the screen, which statistically can be interpreted by a bell shaped, bell shaped curve

02:56.300 --> 02:59.120
centered on the lit aperture.

02:59.870 --> 03:06.350
This tells us where the single particles hits the screen, accumulating one after the other in a region

03:06.350 --> 03:13.880
around the little center, and which describes our uncertainty on the whereabouts of the particle that

03:13.880 --> 03:18.950
formally is given by the Heisenberg's uncertainty relation.

03:20.660 --> 03:29.390
This means that before the measurement, we can interpret the particle as being in all places at once

03:29.780 --> 03:40.130
when it when it traverses Region Delta X of this size, and once it is in front of the screen, which

03:40.130 --> 03:48.680
is shortly before the wavefunction collapses to a point, it is everywhere simultaneously allowing the

03:48.680 --> 03:52.580
space interval described by the distribution function.

03:53.940 --> 04:00.360
Considering that the position in space of a particle is also a property that describes its quantum state,

04:01.230 --> 04:08.970
recall that in quantum mechanics the position is in fact obtained via the position observable the upright

04:08.970 --> 04:16.620
position of the operator, which is the ex operator, then this suggests a more general interpretation,

04:17.250 --> 04:24.870
namely that before this instant of interaction of the particle with the detector or the detector screen,

04:25.590 --> 04:31.990
we must consider it in a superposition of states before they enter that area.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.940
The interaction, the particles location in space is not just unknown.

04:36.210 --> 04:41.040
It is in a position of several possible locations.

04:43.030 --> 04:50.170
That is also why we cannot interpret Heisenberg's uncertainty as something due to our ignorance about

04:50.170 --> 04:58.450
the position of the particle in terms of a logical or reasoning that that is the particle is in one

04:58.570 --> 05:07.720
or the other state, it must instead be interpreted as a logical end, as a coexistence of states,

05:08.050 --> 05:11.800
that is, with all possible states superimposed.

05:13.180 --> 05:18.100
We should we should say the particle is simultaneously in many possible states.

05:19.560 --> 05:28.020
Note how this is in line with the linearity of Schrodinger's equation and that we defined in the lecture

05:28.320 --> 05:29.880
on Schrodinger's equation.

05:30.930 --> 05:39.390
And this is an equation which is ultimately that which one calculates to calculate the evolution in

05:39.390 --> 05:41.550
time of the quantum state.

05:42.480 --> 05:49.740
And in that occasion, we said that if you have two solutions of this, of the Schrodinger equation,

05:50.340 --> 05:56.270
the sum of these two solutions is, again, a solution of running an equation here.

05:56.970 --> 06:01.680
The same reappears in a different form, but it is the same principle.

06:01.980 --> 06:10.680
If a particle is allowed to be in one or another place, then it is also allowed to be in both places.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.850
Quantum mechanics should be taken seriously in this sense.

06:13.860 --> 06:22.170
In fact, it challenges us to believe that a physical object can be in two or even many possible places

06:22.170 --> 06:23.190
at the same time.

06:24.170 --> 06:27.350
Or in no physical state at all, we might say.

06:29.340 --> 06:38.190
This strange ubiquity of particles conveys a deeper meaning to the computational relations, the fact

06:38.190 --> 06:48.120
that observable the of the observable X and P do not commute means not only that, once we try to determine

06:48.120 --> 06:58.050
X with high precision the values of the get zumaya, so to speak, but that this implies also the existence

06:58.050 --> 06:59.520
of state superposition.

07:00.450 --> 07:08.070
If two dynamical variables are represented by two NONCOMMUTATIVE operators, once a measurement of the

07:08.070 --> 07:13.950
first is done, a superposition of states corresponding to the other dynamic variable is automatically

07:13.980 --> 07:14.640
induced.

07:15.970 --> 07:23.770
This suggests also how this weird super position effect must not be exclusive to space, but is a much

07:23.770 --> 07:31.210
more general principle of quantum mechanics, since, as we know, there are also other observables

07:31.210 --> 07:32.410
that do not commute.

07:34.210 --> 07:41.200
For instance, as you will remember, the spin does not commute in quantum physics, the concept of

07:41.200 --> 07:51.640
the state uncertainty must be interpreted as superposition of states, not as an and our ignorance of

07:51.640 --> 07:53.140
which state is realised.

07:53.260 --> 07:59.350
It is not about not knowing there is some state out there that is realised.

07:59.440 --> 08:07.480
The particle is perhaps in spin up, but we don't know know the particle is in spin up and spin down

08:07.480 --> 08:07.930
state.

08:09.970 --> 08:16.090
Let us visualize and define this a bit more rigorously with the with the help.

08:17.600 --> 08:25.790
Of this scheme, and that should be known to you if you followed the lectures on the S.G. experiments

08:26.030 --> 08:28.340
and the commutative and the computational relations.

08:29.390 --> 08:39.260
As usual, a first as jetset device prepares a particle in that Kate Plus eight and state here to prepare

08:39.380 --> 08:46.850
means that those particles showing up with a spin upstate along that were first selected from the source

08:47.090 --> 08:56.870
by performing a measurement that project them into the that plus I can state that is the best that observable

08:57.050 --> 08:58.640
comes into the plate.

08:58.940 --> 09:06.530
First, since the asset observable this that operator does not commute with A.

09:06.530 --> 09:09.530
S, X and Y observables.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.760
This measurement automatically renders the particle spin.

09:15.290 --> 09:19.970
State along the X and Y axis as uncertain.

09:21.100 --> 09:30.430
And uncertain does not only mean that once measured, there is a 50 percent chance of finding the particle

09:30.430 --> 09:40.450
in a XCAP plus or minus Eisenstaedt, but that before the next measurement, it is in both states.

09:41.900 --> 09:46.070
The XCAP plus and minus states coexist.

09:47.150 --> 09:54.080
Before such a measurement takes place, therefore, we can represent the state of the spin up particle

09:54.080 --> 10:03.440
along that that axis that that plus I can state in superposition of both spin up and spin down along

10:03.440 --> 10:07.520
the x axis basis as shown here.

10:08.330 --> 10:15.410
That is, we have that plus equals one over squared, two times X squared plus.

10:16.860 --> 10:26.380
Plus one over square to X minus, this is not just a mathematical description which furnishes the statistics,

10:26.380 --> 10:34.320
the probable probabilities of a result, that little tiny plus here represents a superposition of spin

10:34.320 --> 10:35.070
and states.

10:36.050 --> 10:41.270
Whereas, as usual, the square root of coefficients tell us something about the probability of getting

10:41.270 --> 10:48.380
one or the other result should an X directed measurement take place.

10:50.440 --> 10:58.900
Therefore, the two particles intrinsic momentum along the x axis and this example, similar considerations

10:58.900 --> 11:02.020
would hold for the Y axis as well.

11:03.390 --> 11:12.370
These are both present as if the particle is spinning clockwise and anticlockwise at the same time.

11:14.210 --> 11:23.030
Again, formally, one can see this as a natural consequence of Schrodinger's equation linearity, if

11:23.450 --> 11:32.390
the eigenvector get X plus and the eigenvector get X minus are two allowed states.

11:33.140 --> 11:43.850
And our solution of the Schrodinger equation, then also there are some get X plus and minus are also

11:44.060 --> 11:46.910
an allowed single quantum state.

11:47.180 --> 11:50.390
That is a solution of the Schrodinger equation.

11:50.390 --> 11:56.620
And the same fits also for the Z and X, Y and Z component, whatever component you wish.

11:57.740 --> 12:06.650
Not only do quantum particles, so to speak, multi locate and are ubiquitous, but they even multi

12:06.650 --> 12:08.210
spin, so to speak.

12:10.530 --> 12:18.030
If you make a second measurement, then let us so proceed with a S.G. construction that we have already

12:18.030 --> 12:22.920
seen, but now at this time we will interpret it with a superposition principle.

12:23.760 --> 12:30.720
Therefore, if we make a second measurement which projects the particles spin along the x axis with

12:30.720 --> 12:40.890
the SGX device, the X spin has been measured and the spin up in state X plus selected.

12:42.180 --> 12:53.010
The get minus 18 states are blocked internally in the S.G. device, I place the equation of the first

12:53.400 --> 13:01.170
set of eyes on the EU that the device figure here, block diagram here again, there's a superposition

13:01.170 --> 13:03.240
along the x axis has gone.

13:03.360 --> 13:07.170
Now Wetterstedt reduction has occurred.

13:08.310 --> 13:17.370
But since the spin operator as X does not compute with that, the particle state along the Z axis is

13:17.370 --> 13:18.900
now no longer in.

13:18.900 --> 13:30.360
I can state that get plus the spin up particles igan state along the x axis basis, the X plus I can,

13:30.490 --> 13:39.150
it can be represented now as being in superposition of both spin up and spin down along that, that

13:39.150 --> 13:40.520
axis basis.

13:41.430 --> 13:46.140
So we have a similar equation as before, but with the X and Z.

13:47.500 --> 13:52.120
Directions replaced with one another.

13:52.670 --> 13:53.290
Yeah, we have.

13:54.290 --> 14:04.980
X plus equals one always right to square root to that Kate plus plus one over square to that minus with

14:04.990 --> 14:06.410
the usual interpretation.

14:07.010 --> 14:17.600
Finally, the third stage device in that selects out either that kid plus or the that kid minus state

14:18.050 --> 14:22.180
as amply discussed in the section on the S.G. devices.

14:22.520 --> 14:32.360
And from this equation, this means it selects out one or the other against it, which however it previously

14:32.390 --> 14:34.130
was in a superposition state.

14:34.910 --> 14:42.230
So now we have a different state of the system each time that they're.

14:43.220 --> 14:50.360
Selection is being made or the measurement, of course, therefore the same quantum state that Kate

14:50.360 --> 14:56.600
Plus represented in that basis can be represented in the X-axis eigenvector basis as well.

14:57.260 --> 15:05.030
But there it appears as a superposition along that component in a similar fashion.

15:05.030 --> 15:13.270
Quantum algebra allows for the representation of a quantum state in any desired eigenvector basis.

15:13.970 --> 15:22.610
We just made an example between that set an X coordinate system, but we could make this equally well

15:22.610 --> 15:26.330
also for the Y axis basis or any basis in between.

15:27.180 --> 15:37.010
It is like seeing the very same quantum state from different geometric perspective by a change of coordinates

15:37.250 --> 15:45.200
or just rotating the system, for example, with a rotational translation, but leaving it physically

15:45.560 --> 15:46.490
unaltered.

15:49.150 --> 15:56.710
So far, we have considered particles with a mass, but another example where quantum superposition

15:56.710 --> 16:00.010
takes place is a superposition of photon states.

16:01.650 --> 16:09.450
Photons are massless particles and in vacuum, always travel with the speed of light, which is about

16:09.750 --> 16:10.560
three times.

16:11.560 --> 16:20.050
Ten to the power, eight meters per second, whatever the speed and dynamic state of the observer or

16:20.080 --> 16:28.660
the measurement apparatus is, this is one of the main principles of special relativity that tells us

16:28.840 --> 16:31.200
the speed of light is always the same.

16:32.320 --> 16:40.570
You will never see a photon at rest as you do as you can can do in the case of particles, material,

16:40.570 --> 16:42.190
particles possessing a mass.

16:43.840 --> 16:50.620
And we already saw that the positive or negative spin of a photon is oriented along the direction of

16:50.620 --> 16:58.150
propagation or contrary to it, and is determined by the right or left handed rotation of circular,

16:58.480 --> 17:00.790
polarized electromagnetic waves.

17:01.910 --> 17:05.810
What polarizers select out?

17:06.740 --> 17:15.290
However, are not spins, but if the photons electric field orientation, this does not mean that photons

17:15.290 --> 17:20.950
can't be in superposition state as particles can be in two places at once.

17:21.450 --> 17:26.200
Material particles can be in two places at once or have two spins at once.

17:26.600 --> 17:30.290
Also, photons could have two polarizations at once.

17:31.940 --> 17:39.230
We can apply a similar reasoning to photons as we have done to two electrons, provided we remember

17:39.230 --> 17:47.870
that the former are particles with spin, one directed along or contrary only to the momentum.

17:49.360 --> 17:57.160
Of direction, momentum, contrary to fermions, which are particles with only two possible spin one-half

17:57.160 --> 18:00.940
outcomes that, however, can point towards any direction.

18:02.140 --> 18:10.180
And for photons, we must also keep in mind that the polarization vector is restricted to any x Y plane

18:10.720 --> 18:19.000
perpendicular to the direction of propagation in this case, we labeled it that Z direction and that

18:19.000 --> 18:28.240
photons are not described by Spinous, but by the electromagnetic field vectors which return on to themselves

18:28.240 --> 18:31.200
after 360 degrees rotation.

18:31.780 --> 18:39.490
That is all angles here are half as much as those of fermions.

18:41.650 --> 18:49.870
Then let us agree on how to use certain symbolic conventions, since in the literature, this can be

18:49.870 --> 18:50.950
quite different.

18:51.160 --> 18:56.380
Let us be flexible and use different symbolic conventions according to the context.

18:58.360 --> 19:05.460
We will use the following state rectors notation for the up and down vertical polarisation state vector.

19:05.950 --> 19:12.090
This cat here with the arrow that goes up or just a.

19:13.140 --> 19:24.960
And we get vertical standing V Capital Letter V extending for vertical and also the arrow pointing down

19:25.470 --> 19:33.900
because they are obviously parallel and parallel to each other, but both represent the vertical paralyzation

19:34.740 --> 19:39.300
for the right and left, horizontal paralyzation there, right and left.

19:39.300 --> 19:44.750
Kett, which correspondence corresponds to the horizontal parallelization?

19:44.760 --> 19:53.820
Keat for the diagonal, 45 degrees under 35 degrees to under 25 degrees and 315 degrees polarizations

19:54.180 --> 20:05.940
their respective cats and cat arrows that you can see here, or the corresponding codes written in degrees

20:06.720 --> 20:07.530
respectively.

20:09.230 --> 20:18.500
And we can also just write a generic polarisation of teta degrees as cat teta degrees.

20:20.730 --> 20:26.850
Here, let us use first GraphicLy, more intuitive error convention here.

20:26.910 --> 20:35.520
First, we have linearly polarized light along the vertical direction or simply vertically vertical,

20:35.520 --> 20:36.870
polarized photons.

20:38.220 --> 20:46.260
Now notice how due to simple geometrical trigonometric considerations, a vector, a vertical vector

20:46.260 --> 20:48.270
can be decomposed as a sum.

20:48.690 --> 20:59.540
That is the superposition of two diagonal vectors of 45 and minus 45 degrees or instead of minus forty

20:59.820 --> 21:00.510
five degrees.

21:00.540 --> 21:04.980
We can also consider a 315 degrees component.

21:06.240 --> 21:14.940
Then we can reason by analogy and say that as an electron spin along at the Z direction, it changes

21:14.940 --> 21:19.200
its X spin component into X spin superposition state.

21:20.040 --> 21:29.220
So a photons polarisation again, not to confuse with a photon spin along the vertical y direction selected

21:29.220 --> 21:37.710
from an unauthorized light source superimposes it's minus 45 degrees and plus 45 degrees.

21:38.040 --> 21:46.500
Polarisation components into a diagonal paralyzation superposition state as.

21:47.650 --> 21:48.130
Written.

21:49.590 --> 21:51.390
In the equation here.

21:52.750 --> 22:00.580
And what this equation tells us is that a photon in a vertical polarization state.

22:02.070 --> 22:06.240
Is as superposition of the two diagonal.

22:07.360 --> 22:16.420
Polarizations state, and when we measure the photon and vertical polarization stayed a long one or

22:16.420 --> 22:24.010
the other diagonal 45 degrees direction, we have 50 percent chance to.

22:25.330 --> 22:28.390
Have a photo getting through or not?

22:29.390 --> 22:37.720
That's what this equation tells us, and it is about superposition and it tells us about the quantum

22:37.720 --> 22:47.860
state of a photon in a vertical position, in a vertical polarization state and which can be decomposed

22:47.860 --> 22:56.560
as a superposition of two diagonal states and the corresponding measurement outcome in case we make

22:56.830 --> 23:00.860
a measurement along these two diagonal directions.

23:01.720 --> 23:09.370
Notice how we use the word selection when speaking of the action of polarizers.

23:10.570 --> 23:14.770
Polarizers do not involve state reduction.

23:15.430 --> 23:21.190
State reduction is always something that happens when a measurement is done.

23:21.640 --> 23:28.690
That is, there is a measurement device from which we can read out information.

23:29.560 --> 23:33.910
As long as there is a polarizer in between, it changes.

23:33.910 --> 23:39.040
It selects the state of a quantum particle.

23:39.610 --> 23:48.700
But there is not still not a real measurement since there with let alone you do not read out any information,

23:49.060 --> 23:52.200
you transform the state of the system.

23:52.720 --> 24:00.580
So it is also necessary to distinguish between a selection and a state reduction, which are two different

24:00.580 --> 24:02.500
things, as we will see later.

24:04.310 --> 24:08.150
Since this turns out to be extremely important for.

24:09.110 --> 24:12.110
Understanding also other quantum phenomena.

24:14.580 --> 24:20.220
Similarly, similarly, the same thing can be said about a diagonal polarization vector.

24:20.790 --> 24:29.160
This also can be decomposed as a sum of two vectors, namely as a superposition of two vertical polarization

24:29.160 --> 24:32.140
vectors of zero degrees and 90 degrees.

24:32.940 --> 24:40.980
That is, one can represent the diagonal polarisation as a superposition of the vertical and horizontal

24:40.980 --> 24:42.630
one as shown here.

24:44.510 --> 24:49.040
I assume now that you understand the meaning of these equations.

24:51.320 --> 24:58.850
Or another example not shown, we just display the equation here, the horizontal polarization vector

24:58.850 --> 25:06.200
can be represented as a sum of the 45 degrees and 135 diagonal vectors as shown here.

25:08.190 --> 25:14.790
Of course, many other combinations are possible, after all, that is nothing else than the vector's

25:14.790 --> 25:18.150
summation, according to the parallelogram law.

25:18.660 --> 25:26.700
See also how this has been shortly explained in the appendix and that you should have learned in school

25:26.880 --> 25:29.190
and does not look particularly surprising.

25:29.790 --> 25:37.740
Paralyzation Vector's as any other physical vector quantities such such as speed, accelerate, acceleration

25:37.740 --> 25:47.520
forces, etc. are treated with a vector formalism and can be decomposed appropriately in different ways,

25:47.520 --> 25:48.390
different vectors.

25:48.930 --> 25:53.550
In quantum physics, however, this acquires a deeper significance.

25:54.210 --> 26:01.020
A quantum state superposition superposition is not just the addition of two states resulting into another

26:01.020 --> 26:06.510
state, but the realization of both states simultaneously.

26:08.310 --> 26:16.170
Let us place the previous equation here and this angle on the upper left just to get an overall view.

26:18.330 --> 26:25.440
Now, this suggests to introduce for Fortum polarization a more general, better basis description,

26:25.980 --> 26:29.160
as we have already done with FermÃ­n Particle's.

26:30.200 --> 26:38.450
Here, the first base is Vector is the vertical paralyzation, the second base is vector is the horizontal

26:38.450 --> 26:46.390
parallelization Keat and which are described by these vector one zero and zero one, respectively.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.820
And the third is a generalized version.

26:50.930 --> 26:55.730
Pluralization state director, Independence of the Angelita.

26:57.970 --> 27:05.620
The letter one can be treated as a superposition of the two Baz's vectors and be can be formulated as

27:05.620 --> 27:16.060
follows, a catheter is nothing as as a superposition of the vertical and horizontal Keat vectors.

27:17.250 --> 27:23.460
Times for the horizontal force, for the vertical get, because I'm Teater.

27:24.420 --> 27:36.510
Plus, the horizontal at times, Santita, note that this time the cosine and sine functions have titta

27:36.510 --> 27:46.230
instead of to dependent's, which means photons return to themselves after rotations of 360 degrees

27:47.010 --> 27:54.030
and we might see the world behave nicely in human terms again.

27:56.430 --> 28:03.450
Then finally, applying Bond's rule, as we have done for Spinous, taking the model square of the state

28:03.450 --> 28:10.560
vector gives finally this expression for the probability to find some.

28:12.050 --> 28:19.730
Polarization along some direction, that is, this tells us that there is a cosine square teater probability

28:19.850 --> 28:27.350
that a photon slips through a polarizer, rotated relative relatively to the vertical y axis by two

28:27.360 --> 28:31.100
degrees if it has been prepared in the.

28:31.950 --> 28:41.310
Cat, we are state and equivalently assigned square to probability to measure a photon if it has been

28:41.310 --> 28:43.560
prepared in the cat.

28:45.690 --> 28:47.190
Horizontal Eisenstaedt.

28:49.460 --> 28:56.930
To sum up and conclude this tour on the quantum superposition principle, what we should keep in mind

28:56.930 --> 29:04.520
is the bottom line of all this, at least for noncommutative observables, it makes no sense to say

29:04.520 --> 29:12.010
that a particle is in one or another state until a measurement has projected it into an Afghan state.

29:12.770 --> 29:19.220
We can only say something about the probability to measure one or another outcome and not because of

29:19.220 --> 29:27.800
ignorance, but because the system is intrinsically in a position of states until you measure it.

29:28.780 --> 29:36.910
Or that might look impossible or unappealing to some, but what is definite is that once you use the

29:36.970 --> 29:43.360
quantum superposition in the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, then everything, everything

29:43.360 --> 29:44.040
works fine.

29:45.100 --> 29:53.740
Only if the superposition principle is taken seriously with the match between the theory and the experimental

29:53.740 --> 29:56.840
check with reality turned out to be correct.

29:57.820 --> 30:05.170
And later on, we shall encounter other experiments which will underline this further.
