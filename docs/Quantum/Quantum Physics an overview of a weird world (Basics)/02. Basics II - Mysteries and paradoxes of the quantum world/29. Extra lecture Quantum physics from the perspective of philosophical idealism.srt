00:00.700 --> 00:07.840
The philosophical implications of quantum phenomena evidenced in the experiments, in the proceedings,

00:07.990 --> 00:16.480
in the preceding lectures are in fact, many in particular, the kind of world view that emerges from

00:16.480 --> 00:18.460
it is a matter of debate.

00:18.460 --> 00:25.300
And to a certain degree, we may also say it's a matter of personal preference and tastes.

00:26.130 --> 00:36.000
So to speak, however, before concluding this chorus, I would like to focus our attention on an aspect

00:36.000 --> 00:44.670
that most physicists and not really philosophers as well who would like to maintain an ordinary form

00:44.670 --> 00:53.790
of realism, prefer to suppress and ignore, namely that quantum physics seems to support some sort

00:53.790 --> 00:55.920
of idealistic worldview.

00:58.260 --> 01:06.510
The doctrine of philosophical idealism dates back to the time of Plato, it reemerged then in different

01:06.510 --> 01:13.890
forms over and over again throughout the centuries and continents and continues to influence philosophical

01:13.890 --> 01:16.050
inquiry to the present day.

01:17.490 --> 01:24.720
There are so many versions of idealism and subtleties to be considered that it is difficult to define

01:24.720 --> 01:26.370
them in a few sentences.

01:26.370 --> 01:30.490
And we won't be able to go through all of the details here.

01:31.290 --> 01:39.990
However, what they all have in common and what is relevant for purposes of philosophical considerations

01:39.990 --> 01:48.180
in quantum physics is the recognition that mere empiricism, that is the act of measurement of physical

01:48.180 --> 01:56.640
quantity alone and which characterises all the exact sciences, does not lead to the revelation of an

01:56.640 --> 01:59.790
objective and ultimate reality and truth.

02:01.600 --> 02:09.310
Whether we like it or not, we are always forced to observe reality through our throughout through our

02:09.310 --> 02:19.660
perceptions and which are mediated by human senses or through also measurement devices, and we have

02:19.660 --> 02:24.780
to interpret reality through the lens of our mind.

02:26.410 --> 02:33.160
The question of what should be regarded as an objective reality, independent from our sensorial means

02:33.160 --> 02:40.960
and mental representations, is a much more contrived matter than we are accustomed to believe in,

02:41.830 --> 02:44.950
especially among scientists, I would say.

02:46.770 --> 02:53.520
We have already seen many examples of this in quantum physics, and it is precisely in the quantum domain

02:53.670 --> 02:57.130
that this issue presents itself most pressingly.

02:58.410 --> 03:05.490
However, to clarify the question of what reality is and what the world what what the word reality is

03:05.490 --> 03:11.790
supposed to mean, let us reason first with experiments taken from a classical world.

03:13.940 --> 03:20.750
For example, think of the measurement or the measurement of temperature, we associate temperature

03:20.750 --> 03:24.920
with the sensation that of a body being hot or cold.

03:25.670 --> 03:33.050
However, human sensations are subjective and are relative characterizations of the physical domain,

03:33.620 --> 03:40.850
not scientific statements that are supposed to describe what we believe to be an objective reality.

03:41.810 --> 03:49.610
Out there, so to speak, and which is supposed to be independent from what we believe, perceive or

03:49.610 --> 03:50.120
think.

03:51.940 --> 03:59.890
What then does a thermometer really measure according to thermodynamics, a temperature is a measure

03:59.890 --> 04:07.120
of a quantity directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of the body, solid

04:07.870 --> 04:15.880
gas of fluid, and which is caused by the Brownian motion and resulting from its random scattering of

04:15.880 --> 04:18.270
the particles in physics.

04:18.520 --> 04:25.300
Another way to express the same phenomenon is to state the temperature measures the ability of a body

04:25.300 --> 04:27.670
to transfer to transfer heat.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.650
The hotter object will transfer heat to the colder one.

04:34.090 --> 04:41.950
However, when we read a temperature from a thermometer, we see a number evalu just as color quantity

04:41.950 --> 04:48.250
expressed in a particular scale Kelvin Celsius or Fahrenheit, Fahrenheit or whatever.

04:49.970 --> 04:57.230
Instinctively, we associate that number with the sensation or in the case of scientist with a mental

04:57.230 --> 05:06.080
projection that depicts molecules vibrating randomly due to Brownian motion or imagining he transfers.

05:07.240 --> 05:13.660
Of course, you can take a microscope and literally, literally see the random walk of pollen grains

05:13.660 --> 05:21.190
and water, as Robert Brown did, and convince convince yourself that the thermometer is a device that

05:21.190 --> 05:28.180
translates the objective reality of the Brownian motion of molecules into a number.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.990
We should, however, be aware of the fact that the measurement of physical magnitude, reducing it

05:36.990 --> 05:46.230
to a sign on a number like that of a temperature tells us nothing about the objective truth for which

05:46.230 --> 05:47.580
that symbol stands.

05:48.730 --> 05:56.890
If we knew only the symbol, the number without relation, we any relation to what it levels, we could

05:56.890 --> 05:59.470
say nothing about what it really represents.

06:01.120 --> 06:07.330
Moreover, Brown only shifted the measurement from a measurement apparatus like a thermometer to a human

06:07.330 --> 06:11.140
side sensor mean amplified by a microscope.

06:12.670 --> 06:17.350
Does this finally tell us something about an ultimate objective reality?

06:19.240 --> 06:26.920
Hardly any scientist or philosopher will admit that human perception furnishes an objective understanding

06:26.920 --> 06:30.880
of reality from the practical point of view.

06:30.910 --> 06:32.080
We don't bother.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.850
We just take a measurement.

06:34.660 --> 06:43.150
And most scientists are happy with the empiric data and introduction in exploring how we perceive and

06:43.150 --> 06:52.330
conceive the world could be that of following British philosopher and author Owen Barfield and who once

06:52.330 --> 06:57.110
invited us to do and ask ourselves the following question.

06:57.910 --> 06:58.900
Look at the rainbow.

06:59.260 --> 07:00.700
Is it really there?

07:02.860 --> 07:10.510
Of course, we should not regard a rainbow as an object having and any concrete spatial and material

07:10.510 --> 07:18.640
existence, it is, so to speak, an intangible appearance about which we can't say that it is really

07:18.640 --> 07:19.120
their.

07:20.590 --> 07:25.320
We believe that only the raindrops and the sun are really there.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.900
But the rainbow is not.

07:30.030 --> 07:37.380
Nonetheless, we can't state that the rainbow is a mere hallucination either, since also others are

07:37.380 --> 07:38.010
seeing it.

07:39.550 --> 07:46.330
This fact, however, doesn't imply that the rainbow is actually there, rather that it is a shared

07:46.360 --> 07:55.240
or collective appearance or representation that is an inter subjective experience, not an objective

07:55.240 --> 07:55.870
entity.

07:57.620 --> 08:05.630
While we agree that the rainbow isn't really there, in what sense instead is a tree, a mountain or

08:06.290 --> 08:07.910
the moon really there?

08:10.090 --> 08:18.220
The distinction between the two cases is less obvious than we might believe, because as the appearance

08:18.220 --> 08:25.150
of the rainbow comes into existence, due to the interaction of the sunlight with the rain droplets,

08:25.990 --> 08:32.740
so the appearance of the tree, a mountain or the moon comes into existence due to the interaction of

08:32.740 --> 08:35.980
the sunlight with their molecules and atoms.

08:37.640 --> 08:44.600
One can press the argument for further and note how also molecules and atoms are themselves again,

08:44.910 --> 08:51.530
another appearance which is realized due to the interaction of a measurement device with the elementary

08:51.530 --> 09:00.800
particles they are made of and out of which by a mental extrapolation, we construct a mental atomic

09:00.800 --> 09:01.280
model.

09:02.930 --> 09:08.570
In fact, nobody has seen molecules, atoms and elementary particles directly.

09:10.080 --> 09:18.180
And this leads us into the realm of quantum physics, where instead of reaching a final objective entity

09:18.870 --> 09:27.900
that is really there, whatever that might mean and from which we can in principle build by a bottom

09:27.900 --> 09:37.230
up process, all there is nature instead answers us, as you know by now, very well, with even more

09:37.380 --> 09:46.360
elusive phenomena further detached from any of our sensory means and conceptual constructs at bottom.

09:46.920 --> 09:54.840
Everything boils down to representations of our sense minds, so to speak, our sensory, our mind based

09:54.840 --> 10:00.600
on our sense perceptions, using barflies words.

10:01.830 --> 10:11.280
The familiar world, which we see and know around us, the blue sky with white clouds in it, the noise

10:11.280 --> 10:19.560
of a waterfall or a motor bus, the shapes of flowers and their scent, the gesture and utterance of

10:19.560 --> 10:27.990
animals and the faces of our friends, the world to which, apart from the special inquiry of physics,

10:28.950 --> 10:32.970
experts of all kinds methodically investigate.

10:33.940 --> 10:37.330
Is a system of collective representations.

10:39.510 --> 10:46.980
The time comes when we must either accept this as a truth about the world or reject the theories of

10:46.980 --> 10:49.200
physics as an elaborate delusion.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.060
We cannot have it both ways.

10:54.750 --> 11:02.910
But to illustrate how the demarcation between objective and subjective is much subtler, then we are

11:02.910 --> 11:10.920
accustomed to believing let us employ another example still remaining in the classical macroscopic world

11:11.460 --> 11:14.760
from the standpoint of neurobiology.

11:16.530 --> 11:20.070
Let us think how we know that objects exist.

11:21.230 --> 11:24.420
How do we know that an object exists?

11:24.750 --> 11:27.060
What does it mean this world existing?

11:28.670 --> 11:31.730
Say, for example, you see a table in a room.

11:32.890 --> 11:33.610
First of all.

11:34.620 --> 11:42.900
For that to be possible, you would need a light source illuminating the table, obviously not without

11:42.900 --> 11:49.470
light as a medium which encodes in an electromagnetic signal the table, you can tell nothing.

11:50.460 --> 11:58.560
What you see is not the table directly, therefore, in itself as it is in itself, but the light reflected

11:58.560 --> 11:59.000
from it.

12:00.540 --> 12:07.830
You can't claim that you see the table as it is, you can say only how the table presents itself to

12:07.830 --> 12:11.400
your eyes through an electromagnetic interaction.

12:13.200 --> 12:20.070
However, the decisive point we should realize is that when the light reaches the retina, our eye retina,

12:20.640 --> 12:25.380
at which point the eyes anatomy has already distorted the input into it.

12:25.560 --> 12:33.930
Two dimensional Upside-Down image, by the way, at that point, there is still a long way to go before

12:33.960 --> 12:34.950
you see something.

12:36.250 --> 12:43.770
Because the photons must, first of all, be transformed and translated further into another representation,

12:44.770 --> 12:51.610
they must first trigger a very complex sequence of biochemical reactions in the retina photoreceptors,

12:51.730 --> 12:53.460
photoreceptors of your retina.

12:54.730 --> 13:02.470
Once the electromagnetic wave has been absorbed, it it is now an electrical and chemical signal which

13:02.470 --> 13:06.880
represents the table that you are seeing, not still not seeing.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.080
Because, in fact, do you see something at that point?

13:10.840 --> 13:12.900
No, you still don't see anything.

13:13.510 --> 13:21.310
The visual information codified in the electro biochemical impulse must still travel from the retina,

13:21.400 --> 13:30.160
from your eye retina and through the optic nerve to a part of your brain, the so-called optic miasma.

13:31.070 --> 13:39.740
Where the left and right visual fields get mixed up between the left and right hemisphere brain hemispheres

13:40.250 --> 13:48.740
and before being sent to the lateral Jenny Koolade nucleus, so-called air relays a relay center in

13:48.740 --> 13:49.460
the thalamus.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.050
Then.

13:52.210 --> 14:02.980
These information can get through your brain, but still at this point, you still see absolutely nothing

14:04.750 --> 14:11.890
because the visual information must be relayed further to the visual cortex of the posterior part of

14:11.890 --> 14:12.360
the brain.

14:13.990 --> 14:20.320
We at this point, we still see nothing because the visual cortex not only receives signals that no

14:20.320 --> 14:28.390
longer have much to do with what once represented the table, but must first perform an extremely complex

14:28.390 --> 14:33.190
process of analysis, segmentation and integration of information.

14:35.020 --> 14:41.800
The visual visual cortex is divided into five areas based on function and structure.

14:42.840 --> 14:51.060
First, the relayed signal from the thalamus reaches the first area, which processes information for

14:51.060 --> 14:55.530
pattern recognition purposes, but you still see nothing.

14:56.520 --> 15:04.020
The second region of the visual cortex cortex receives this further altered representation from the

15:04.020 --> 15:11.940
first layer and continues to filter out other information, such as colors, spatial properties and

15:11.940 --> 15:14.880
more complex patterns of the objects perceives.

15:15.420 --> 15:18.480
And still no table is inside.

15:19.350 --> 15:22.760
Still, at this point, you see nothing later.

15:23.070 --> 15:30.870
The remaining three areas perform other tasks, other tasks such as spatial tasks and detection of movements

15:30.870 --> 15:31.520
and so on.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.630
It's quite complicated matter.

15:33.630 --> 15:37.260
And still nowadays we do not know exactly what the brain is doing.

15:37.260 --> 15:40.730
But this is not so important for our purposes.

15:41.610 --> 15:47.550
But at this point that ends the information processing of the visual cortex.

15:49.050 --> 15:59.910
And then finally, you see something, right, no, you still don't see anything to become conscious

15:59.910 --> 16:08.820
of the table, the visual cortex must disseminate all its synthesized information to all areas of the

16:08.820 --> 16:09.240
brain.

16:10.280 --> 16:17.600
Then after another very complex neuronal electrochemical process that takes place throughout the brain,

16:18.290 --> 16:25.670
suddenly, for some mysterious reason that nobody can explain, you become literally enlightened by

16:25.670 --> 16:34.100
a visual conscious experience and become aware of how out there is what we call in common language,

16:34.100 --> 16:34.850
a table.

16:36.850 --> 16:44.770
You never had not in the least any contact, direct contact with that object you call table, what you

16:44.770 --> 16:51.220
see at this point is something that has absolutely nothing to do with the electromagnetic signal that

16:51.220 --> 17:01.330
encoded the representation of this representation by biochemical and neuronal representation of the

17:01.330 --> 17:04.330
table and let alone the table itself.

17:05.500 --> 17:13.660
What you perceive of the outer world of the table is a biochemical and electric single signal inside

17:13.900 --> 17:14.680
your brain.

17:15.430 --> 17:16.600
Not more than that.

17:17.710 --> 17:25.600
It is not even a model or not even a representation in the best case, we could call it a mere symbol.

17:27.410 --> 17:34.640
The difference between a model or a representation and the symbol is that the former retains something

17:34.640 --> 17:37.480
of the inherent reality of an object.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.240
The latter is just a symbol, an index.

17:42.980 --> 17:51.890
For example, the sculpture of Plato is a model since it retains something of the form of his appearance,

17:52.550 --> 17:53.600
form and figure.

17:54.620 --> 18:02.690
The name Plato, however, is a symbol you are reading on a piece of paper and you write it Plato and

18:02.690 --> 18:08.050
retains nothing of the of the inherent reality of the person.

18:08.210 --> 18:11.100
It indicates it were played.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.380
Plato is an index.

18:12.860 --> 18:16.510
What we perceive of reality is therefore not even a model.

18:16.700 --> 18:17.240
It is.

18:18.530 --> 18:22.610
Not even a representation, it is a symbol, an index.

18:25.420 --> 18:34.600
However, fortunately for us, it still conveys an illusion of objective reality that is clearly extremely

18:34.600 --> 18:35.410
complex.

18:35.410 --> 18:44.230
Reshuffling of altered, converted, transform, transformed and remodeled impulses is what we perceive

18:44.230 --> 18:45.460
of the outer world.

18:45.850 --> 18:46.730
Nothing else.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.290
What is what we call reality.

18:50.710 --> 18:59.020
Therefore, from the standpoint of you, we have never experienced the world outside of the biochemistry,

18:59.200 --> 19:08.380
inside our brains, and nobody can have any clue as to what reality is objectively, objectively out

19:08.380 --> 19:16.570
there as it is inherently independent from our sensorial and mental representations.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.200
Or symbols, if you prefer.

19:22.280 --> 19:29.420
Turning to the analogy of the previous example with the thermometer, our perception of the world with

19:29.420 --> 19:39.380
our senses and mind stands to its objective reality, just as the read out of temperature with a thermometer

19:39.590 --> 19:42.350
stands to the zigzagging molecules.

19:44.100 --> 19:50.640
And nothing is left of that reality other than an electoral biochemical.

19:51.720 --> 20:01.740
Representation triggering a conscious experience inside of us, just like the heat of Mercury column

20:02.040 --> 20:05.580
in the thermometer, represents the Brownian motion.

20:07.390 --> 20:14.530
Unfortunately, this time we can't resort to Brown's microscope, so to speak, because we don't even

20:14.530 --> 20:22.150
know what that is supposed to mean in some sense, we live in a virtual reality without knowing it,

20:22.510 --> 20:31.080
sort of like in the film The Matrix and can't have access to the real reality, so to speak.

20:33.950 --> 20:41.870
At this point, it becomes clear how while all of this is of no concern for our practical lives and

20:41.870 --> 20:52.010
also for most scientists, I would say the philosopher or the scientist aiming to arrive at objective

20:52.010 --> 21:02.960
truth in questioning the ultimate intrinsic reality of things has a much bigger fish to fry here, because

21:02.960 --> 21:09.710
the distinction between real and unreal, objective and subjective things and the representation of

21:09.710 --> 21:18.620
things, or even the existence or nonexistence of something becomes becomes not at all obvious.

21:20.390 --> 21:29.120
This is not really a new issue for the philosophers of ancient Greece or of the 18th and 19th, 19th

21:29.120 --> 21:36.530
century, did not know anything about nature, about biology and quantum physics, but they were acutely

21:36.530 --> 21:44.240
aware of the fact that our senses and our minds have no direct access to reality as it is.

21:45.820 --> 21:53.860
This led several of them to take sides regarding a conception of reality in which we cannot abstract

21:53.860 --> 21:55.600
from human sense, cognition.

21:57.550 --> 22:04.150
Broadly speaking, one can distinguish at least two categories of philosophical idealism.

22:05.200 --> 22:12.280
One is the so-called ontological or metaphysical idealism, which holds that all reality is a mental

22:12.280 --> 22:21.460
construct and at its foundation regards mind instead of matter as a fundamental constituent of reality.

22:23.030 --> 22:31.670
One of its most notorious supporters was the 18th century Irish bishop and philosopher George Burke

22:31.670 --> 22:32.210
Berkeley.

22:34.540 --> 22:41.230
But since quantum physics does not or does not necessarily support the claim that all of reality is

22:41.230 --> 22:47.860
a mental construct, we will focus our attention on some formulations of the second type of idealism

22:48.760 --> 22:57.850
that of the so-called epistemological or former idealism expressed by the 18th and 19th century German

22:57.850 --> 23:05.950
philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, phratry shelling out to Schopenhauer and later taken up by the

23:05.950 --> 23:13.390
20th century British idealist movement represented by philosophers like Thomas Hale Green and Francis

23:13.390 --> 23:14.980
Herbert Bradley and so on.

23:16.540 --> 23:21.910
These are just some names that may furnish you a direction for further for further reading.

23:22.390 --> 23:26.650
We will certainly not go into their philosophical thought in detail here.

23:27.790 --> 23:36.010
Instead, we will try to illustrate how a similar, very similar worldview emerges from quantum physics.

23:36.440 --> 23:45.970
If we give up our naive realism and embrace a larger concept of reality that questions whether science

23:45.970 --> 23:55.840
is the ultimate tool for investigating ultimate truth without having the pretension of exposing a rigorous

23:55.840 --> 24:02.770
definition and explanation of epistemological idealism, we try to characterize it as follows.

24:04.450 --> 24:13.270
Epistemological idealism posits that all our knowledge about reality being innervate, inevitably mediated

24:13.270 --> 24:19.540
through our senses, is only a formal representation emerging in our minds.

24:19.540 --> 24:31.900
And that these forms can be taken as representatives of things, as they are really relating to an object

24:32.560 --> 24:41.710
should not be mistaken for knowledge of the thing in itself as can't use, used to call it being undistorted

24:41.710 --> 24:44.200
and independent from any mental activity.

24:45.590 --> 24:52.880
Every insight that our knowledge reflects is a structured thought in our minds where we conflate knowledge

24:53.240 --> 24:54.890
with the object of knowledge.

24:56.370 --> 25:05.370
Our minds process census data by organizing it into abstract propositional knowledge that refers to

25:05.370 --> 25:11.640
a quantitative and qualitative properties which the things in themselves do not have.

25:13.400 --> 25:23.030
Kant, in his magnum opus critique of Pure Reason, introduced the form of idealism known as transcendental

25:23.060 --> 25:23.780
idealism.

25:24.950 --> 25:34.460
Idealism, says Kant, does not concern the existence of things, but is only about our modes of representation

25:35.030 --> 25:36.560
of the perceived things.

25:38.000 --> 25:46.370
Also, entities that we take as self-evident and fundamental, such as space and time, are not things

25:46.370 --> 25:52.760
in in themselves, but rather are emerging phenomena in our minds.

25:54.610 --> 26:03.430
Whatever we know, we can't avoid knowing it by filtering it through a sense mine perspective, this

26:03.430 --> 26:11.080
doesn't imply that there is nothing at all or that we must surrender to some form of relativism or nihilism.

26:12.370 --> 26:21.190
There exists a mind independent reality out there in which something else must be the ultimate foundation

26:21.490 --> 26:22.720
of all things.

26:23.890 --> 26:31.840
However, that ultimate reality of things cannot be apprehended by our senses and our minds, which

26:31.840 --> 26:35.490
can present us with only a representation.

26:35.500 --> 26:39.010
Or, I prefer to say, only a symbol of it.

26:40.820 --> 26:49.430
Once we realized this, we must conclude the scientific knowledge which extends and delegates our senses

26:49.820 --> 26:58.790
by mechanical measuring devices also cannot avoid investigating reality by modes of perception and the

26:58.790 --> 26:59.660
representation.

27:01.430 --> 27:09.770
Science, it is is objective only in the sense that it is entirely subjective, but not truly objective.

27:12.010 --> 27:19.750
By intersubjectivity, we mean common, consensual, subjective experiences that.

27:20.500 --> 27:24.610
Can be shared among scientists without ambiguities.

27:27.040 --> 27:36.430
Also, the strictly empirical science is essentially inevitably and necessarily inter subjective and

27:36.430 --> 27:38.350
not really objective.

27:39.220 --> 27:45.970
We can all agree that we see a table in a room or measure the same physical value of a property of something,

27:46.450 --> 27:48.480
say the length of the table.

27:49.420 --> 27:57.340
But that does not imply that we are becoming aware of the way in which the world is constituted beyond

27:57.340 --> 28:02.950
the appearances fabricated inside the brain of a human subject.

28:04.610 --> 28:12.020
Nevertheless, most scientists hold the opinion, more or less unconsciously, that science is the tool

28:12.050 --> 28:19.040
for arriving at an object and subject independent conception of an ultimate and intrinsic reality.

28:20.420 --> 28:28.130
We are, however, not aware of the fact that already is down to earth and simple but strictly scientific

28:28.130 --> 28:29.630
reasoning itself.

28:29.990 --> 28:38.690
As we have exemplified with the neuro biological example of the site process, one can make it clear

28:38.690 --> 28:42.240
that the issue must be somewhat more complicated.

28:43.070 --> 28:50.840
The belief that replacing the human perception such as that of of eyesight with that measurement device,

28:51.260 --> 29:00.500
say with a photo detector and a microscope or a telescope, supposedly allows us to rise to a higher

29:00.500 --> 29:08.410
ontological level from a subjective to a purely objective understanding of a pure and inherent reality.

29:09.590 --> 29:15.710
That is a delusion strongly engraved in our modes of cognition.

29:17.430 --> 29:26.130
This may also be hardwired genetically in our brains due to survival necessities, however, we must

29:26.130 --> 29:35.310
realize how we, as cognize subjects actively contribute to the construction of the object of knowledge

29:36.720 --> 29:42.840
that might well be a subject independent world with things having a being.

29:43.770 --> 29:52.950
Without us looking at it, but this is beyond the possibility of our normal cognition, one by one might

29:52.980 --> 29:57.990
argue for or against an absolute truth, but if any.

29:58.350 --> 30:06.600
Also in science, we are allowed to know it only by a fiction based on subjective experiences as acts

30:06.600 --> 30:07.410
of cognition.

30:08.750 --> 30:16.790
It is precisely when we forget that this process takes place in our mind and our brain in our consciousness,

30:17.180 --> 30:25.910
that we are lured into counterfactual definiteness, which assumes the existence of the properties of

30:25.910 --> 30:33.580
objects even when they have not been measured directly at this point.

30:33.860 --> 30:40.820
We might also answer Einstein's question about the existence of the moon by saying that it continues

30:40.820 --> 30:49.520
to exist when nobody is looking at it, but does so as a subject, the independent state of being that

30:49.520 --> 30:57.830
has nothing to do with a faked existence that our visual and mental representations of the moon lure

30:57.980 --> 31:02.450
us into believing what we take for real.

31:02.450 --> 31:08.870
In contrast to a subject, independent reality stands like the picture of an object projected on a computer

31:08.870 --> 31:16.910
monitor to the electric charges that encode in bits and bytes the picture in a memory.

31:18.560 --> 31:25.520
The picture on the monitor is a projection on a screen which has absolutely no ontological connection

31:26.060 --> 31:32.450
to the letter thing, namely that bits and bytes the electric states in the chip memory.

31:33.890 --> 31:41.540
Instead, in our naive and instinctive apprehension of the things we misinterpret, the former for the

31:41.540 --> 31:47.180
latter, it is the picture for the electoral states in the chip.

31:48.160 --> 31:55.630
As we have seen, EPWs, realism states that if we can predict with certainty the value of a physical

31:55.630 --> 32:02.920
quantity, then there there exists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.

32:04.750 --> 32:12.250
From the Idalis point of view, this is not necessarily an incorrect statement, provided, however,

32:12.250 --> 32:18.390
that we realized that the value of a physical quantity tells us absolutely nothing.

32:18.620 --> 32:23.140
What about what the essence of that element of reality is?

32:24.170 --> 32:33.620
No more no less than that temperature, the sculler quantity that we call temperature reflects the reality

32:34.100 --> 32:36.040
of the Brownian motion.

32:38.990 --> 32:45.800
Transcendental idealism remains agnostic as to the constitution of the ultimate reality of things,

32:46.820 --> 32:54.920
if by realism we mean that objects exist independently of us, then idealism does not contrast with

32:54.920 --> 33:04.130
real realism, though we know only the mind content structure of perceptions inside of us without any

33:04.130 --> 33:07.930
possible direct contact with things outside of us.

33:08.600 --> 33:16.460
We have no reason to deny the existence of the external objects that trigger these sensations, concepts

33:16.580 --> 33:23.210
and apprehensions the human mind can't have and knowledge by identity with things.

33:24.200 --> 33:32.930
Our knowledge of the world begins with a sensorial experience which translates itself into representations,

33:33.440 --> 33:41.630
pictures, figures, symbols, figments and reflections leading to a state of mind.

33:44.420 --> 33:51.830
As I said, this is no new realization or philosophical conception of the year of the relationship between

33:51.830 --> 34:00.830
our conscious perceptions and reality, but it is something we tend to forget, perhaps blinded too

34:00.830 --> 34:09.860
much by the overwhelming success of science and that we instinctively but falsely take for the ultimate

34:09.860 --> 34:15.950
tool to unveil the object of reality of things as they are in themselves.

34:17.340 --> 34:26.640
In fact, already Plato tried to make us aware of this, that we live in what is called nowadays Plato's

34:26.640 --> 34:37.680
Cave, it is like those who lived all their lives chained inside a cave, forced to stare at a blank

34:37.710 --> 34:45.060
wall without having access to the outer world, other than by seeing on the wall the project of the

34:45.120 --> 34:53.220
projected shadows of people passing in front of a fire placed at the caves entrance.

34:54.930 --> 35:01.020
We misinterpret the shadows for real persons because we know nothing else.

35:02.100 --> 35:11.370
Unless we become aware that we know only projected shadows of reality, we will forever live in a world

35:11.370 --> 35:14.780
of delusion without even being aware of it.

35:16.180 --> 35:24.400
Even if we become aware of the fact that we are living in a virtual reality, we can't avoid refiring

35:24.400 --> 35:29.230
inside of us those phenomenal appearances in our minds.

35:31.470 --> 35:37.240
For idealism, things exist, at least for epistemological idealism, things exist.

35:37.920 --> 35:40.270
There is something really out there.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.630
It's not all an illusion of our mind.

35:43.620 --> 35:51.750
Your reality is not degraded as mere illusion, but it is this reality is not endowed with the forms

35:51.750 --> 35:55.320
and qualities we represent it as having.

35:56.430 --> 36:05.310
It's like for the observers in Plato's Cave, they see the shadows, they believe the shadows are the

36:05.340 --> 36:14.620
ultimate reality, and once they awaken, they may believe that then shadows are just illusions.

36:14.670 --> 36:23.330
Yes, they are illusions, but they they are the projection of true reality out there out of the cave.

36:23.730 --> 36:27.600
These persons which shadows they see.

36:29.070 --> 36:34.020
Exist, really, but not in the form of the shadows.

36:36.100 --> 36:44.440
So there is indeed some sort of underlying reality, the universe is not just a fiction in our mind,

36:45.010 --> 36:52.390
but that reality has nothing in common with the constructs and appearances it triggers inside of us,

36:53.470 --> 37:00.610
no more than a shadow of a human body telling us something about the nature and complexity of living

37:00.760 --> 37:01.720
of a living body.

37:04.040 --> 37:13.940
Metter forces, space time forms and numbers subjected to the physical laws have some in here, in here

37:13.940 --> 37:23.150
and existence in itself independent from us, we are able to create in ourselves on an internal screen

37:23.150 --> 37:31.670
of consciousness, like the projections of the shadows on the wall of Plato's Cave, sensory representations

37:31.670 --> 37:39.080
of things which, however, do not reveal to us anything about the things in themselves.

37:41.430 --> 37:48.480
The fact that things like stones and mountains are permanent objects of perception and are subjected

37:48.480 --> 37:54.690
to what we call the laws of physics is by no means a guarantee for an object of knowledge.

37:55.350 --> 38:04.920
If by objective we mean the inherent essence of things as they are independent of our perceptions and

38:04.920 --> 38:06.180
modes of cognition.

38:07.770 --> 38:14.970
What we call matter space, time and forces and particles also are the reflection of a cosmos, which

38:14.970 --> 38:25.500
we experience as mere fabrications in our mind without any objective truth, what things are in themselves

38:25.500 --> 38:27.930
remains completely unknown to us.

38:28.860 --> 38:36.360
The real nature of things independent from ourselves is forever precluded to our human and also scientific

38:36.360 --> 38:36.750
sense.

38:36.750 --> 38:47.760
My knowledge, at least in our evolutionary state, at least as human beings, perhaps some higher form

38:47.910 --> 38:53.420
or more evolved form may be able to have knowledge by identity.

38:54.150 --> 38:57.200
But in our case, that's not for humans.

38:57.210 --> 39:07.380
This is not the case because to use still again Plato's allegory, again, cutting the chains and leaving

39:07.380 --> 39:17.940
the cave so that we know things in themselves as they really are, means that we must first eliminate

39:17.940 --> 39:21.870
the sensory perception and the mental construction of it.

39:23.430 --> 39:31.890
We live in the world given to us as being without allowing us to gain direct contact with that state

39:31.890 --> 39:32.580
of being.

39:33.690 --> 39:37.980
At least not with our present abilities of cognition.

39:40.540 --> 39:50.140
Having existence of being is all there is, everything else is derivative idealism, at least in the

39:50.140 --> 39:52.270
form of a epistemological.

39:52.270 --> 40:01.540
Idealism is therefore not an anti realist conception of the world and of the universe, but rather is

40:01.540 --> 40:09.040
a different form of realism, which does not posit matter spacetime forces or any other phenomena and

40:09.040 --> 40:13.330
mental experiences as a fundamental stuff of reality.

40:15.920 --> 40:22.930
It is in this sense that science should by no means be considered exempt from philosophical idealism.

40:24.250 --> 40:33.100
Also, the most empiric exact rational and analytic science as physics could be considered, must resort

40:33.100 --> 40:42.190
to experiments composed of mechanical sensors and measurement devices which replace, extend and delegates

40:42.520 --> 40:45.100
for our human sensory abilities.

40:45.910 --> 40:55.600
But at the end of the experimental chain, it must always and inevitably convey its result in the form

40:55.600 --> 41:04.000
of numbers, data or pictures that the human mind can interpret and which are interpreted by and through

41:04.060 --> 41:04.870
the human mind.

41:06.500 --> 41:15.020
The character of things in themselves cannot be inferred from any amount of empirical data, science

41:15.020 --> 41:22.820
can only speak about the appearances of cognition, but can it can't go far enough to tell us anything

41:22.940 --> 41:27.800
about the inherent essentiality of the things it cognize us.

41:29.900 --> 41:37.430
Also, our experiments in the laboratory as precise and objective and independent of human intervention

41:37.430 --> 41:46.210
as we might consider them, must be reduced to a cognition of appearances rather than an inherent objective

41:46.220 --> 41:47.390
knowledge of things.

41:48.910 --> 41:57.340
Ideas, concepts, laws and mathematical abstractions are useful guidelines for scientific research

41:57.760 --> 42:07.060
and are necessary for our practical survival, but they do not tell us much about things as they are

42:07.090 --> 42:07.570
really.

42:08.510 --> 42:09.380
In itself.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.460
Scientists should be aware.

42:13.870 --> 42:23.270
And of this something which unfortunately, most of the time they are not that empirical facts are not

42:23.270 --> 42:31.510
the revelation of ultimate truth, and at least when making philosophical claims should distinguish

42:31.660 --> 42:34.900
between appearances and things in themselves.

42:37.350 --> 42:44.580
So let us look at quantum phenomena from the perspective, from this perspective, that of the philosophical

42:44.580 --> 42:53.370
idealist, then several aspects that previously seemed utterly at odds with a naive sense, mind based

42:53.370 --> 42:59.280
form of realism now acquire a different significance.

43:01.480 --> 43:10.000
For example, we realize how the notion of spin, the rotational intrinsic angular momentum of a particle

43:10.840 --> 43:20.920
is already a heavily sensorial and mental laden representation borrowed from the everyday macroscopic

43:21.490 --> 43:22.030
real.

43:23.750 --> 43:32.030
Here, we imagine, which means we project a shadow on our internal mental screen, an extended body

43:32.030 --> 43:39.350
with some form and properties changing its appearance, appearances periodically in space and time.

43:40.710 --> 43:49.590
The very notion of rotation is, however, a concept we reconstruct from a series of subsequent subsequent

43:49.590 --> 43:58.650
appearances, presenting themselves as stimuli in our brains and that we bind together like one does

43:58.650 --> 44:03.060
with the sequence of photographs of a film into a mental movie.

44:04.510 --> 44:13.000
And when it comes to the question of whether this macroscopic notion we call angular momentum makes

44:13.000 --> 44:21.070
any sense at the fundamental level of the of the of an inherent reality of things like they are really

44:21.730 --> 44:28.990
we must realize that we are speaking of useful interest, subjective qualities that, however, have

44:28.990 --> 44:33.730
nothing to do with properties of an ontological reality.

44:35.090 --> 44:42.080
In this sense, the spin of a particle stands to an objective reality, like the subjective experience

44:42.080 --> 44:46.460
of the color of an object Stansel to the object itself.

44:48.240 --> 44:50.040
What about quantum superposition?

44:51.480 --> 44:57.750
This is aspect of quantum mechanics become so weird because we unconsciously equate the very elementary

44:57.750 --> 45:07.710
concept of what we call a physical state of an object to a precise configuration of properties that

45:07.710 --> 45:17.010
this object is supposed to inherently possess, but without being aware that these properties are our

45:17.040 --> 45:21.150
own, just the proposed sense mind constructs.

45:22.600 --> 45:31.000
When we say that the particle has a specific position in space, we are already working with an internal

45:31.210 --> 45:40.420
representation of it, which mistakes mental projections like space and point like entities for real

45:40.420 --> 45:45.200
properties of something that is out there, so to speak.

45:46.850 --> 45:55.370
By doing so, we have already projected into ourselves a fiction of reality that is detached from reality

45:55.370 --> 45:56.150
as it is.

45:57.690 --> 46:06.270
In this sense, the position of a particle in space and time is no more or less objectively real than

46:06.450 --> 46:09.320
its taste, smell or color.

46:11.440 --> 46:20.260
Finally, we can't say with our limited sense mind abilities what a physical state of an object really

46:20.260 --> 46:26.200
is in itself other than formulating it as a state of being.

46:27.600 --> 46:34.050
Quantum states are states of being which we would like to project into a conception of a distinct and

46:34.050 --> 46:42.330
unique spatial temporal relation of properties typical of the macro world, and that we are accustomed

46:42.330 --> 46:44.760
to mapping into our brains.

46:46.230 --> 46:50.280
However, a map does not say much about the territory.

46:51.630 --> 46:59.340
The superposition of a quantum state is simply another state of being, of something that finds no correspondence

46:59.340 --> 47:08.190
in our cognitive map because the reality we perceive with our bodily senses is always in an Afghan state.

47:10.940 --> 47:18.890
To use a metaphor, again, we could compare it to the projection of the shadow of a cylinder on a two

47:18.890 --> 47:26.150
dimensional surface, the measurement of an object in quantum superposition and its related way, function,

47:26.150 --> 47:36.140
collapse or state reduction in quantum projection onto an Afghan state correspond in this analogy to

47:36.140 --> 47:43.370
the projection of the cylinder into the figure of a circle or a square, as you can see in this figure.

47:44.850 --> 47:52.350
At each measurement, we randomly get one or the other result, and we cannot understand how that could

47:52.350 --> 47:58.470
be considered, that from the quantum mechanical point of view, the initial physical state of the object

47:58.470 --> 47:59.850
is always the same.

48:01.780 --> 48:10.630
The cylinder represents the real object in itself, in its state of being, in its essence, as it really

48:10.630 --> 48:11.140
is.

48:12.190 --> 48:22.510
Why are the two possible Two-dimensional figures that Square or the disc stand for the shadowy scientific

48:22.510 --> 48:32.320
sense mind perspective that modifies and alters a projected experience into an abstract internal representation

48:32.890 --> 48:40.990
which is inside of us and which no longer has anything of the essentiality proper to the measured object?

48:42.660 --> 48:48.390
The random appearance of one or the other shape does not imply a modification of the original state

48:48.390 --> 48:55.890
of the cylinder to force the system into an Afghan state means by analogy to maintain the orientation

48:55.890 --> 49:00.480
of the of the cylinder with the direction of the light source.

49:03.130 --> 49:11.170
Additionally, quantum entanglement appears somewhat less mysterious from the standpoint of the philosophical

49:11.170 --> 49:20.170
idealist, our difficulty in accepting a state of being of something singular with no parts and distinctions

49:20.860 --> 49:28.210
can be tracked back to the intrinsic disposition and natural cognitive function of the mind to distinguish,

49:28.780 --> 49:38.770
particularize, dissect, divide and fragment in space and time for analysis and interpretation or what

49:38.770 --> 49:41.350
it perceives all the things of the world.

49:42.640 --> 49:52.210
A quantum entangled object without differentiation and distinguishable parts is in a state of being

49:52.630 --> 49:59.350
which is inherently other and opposite to what the mind's function is able to apprehend.

50:01.040 --> 50:08.250
Because my mind always particularize is fragments, the sex it is in its nature.

50:09.230 --> 50:16.490
It is like trying to understand the meaning of a word by analyzing it in terms of phonemes.

50:17.870 --> 50:25.280
If one is cognitively unable to bind together, sounds into a unique and undifferentiated perception,

50:26.210 --> 50:31.790
the real meaning that the word represents will forever remain precluded.

50:33.150 --> 50:39.960
A quantum entangled system is in a state of being of inherently unity in plurality.

50:41.020 --> 50:48.610
Something that to the mind is self-contradictory and that cannot be reconciled, the principle of quantum

50:48.610 --> 50:56.300
in this indistinguishably is an inherent state of being of electrons or particles.

50:57.100 --> 51:04.240
It is the mind with its instinctive and natural function of separation and distinction that can follow.

51:05.740 --> 51:13.480
At least for those who embrace a bit in this epistemological idealism and who do not regard mental constructs

51:13.480 --> 51:21.100
as a representation of an inherent reality, it is not entanglement that constitutes a conceptual and

51:21.100 --> 51:22.190
ontological problem.

51:23.050 --> 51:23.860
Quite the contrary.

51:24.580 --> 51:31.990
Once we accept that mental conceptions of space and time are mere projects and projections in our conscious

51:31.990 --> 51:36.920
internal experience and that they have no substantial reality.

51:37.720 --> 51:45.660
The question arises why does a fragmented universe appear to us at all in the first place?

51:46.740 --> 51:55.650
Why isn't everything permanently entangled and undifferentiated state, why does this appearance of

51:55.650 --> 51:58.620
fragmentation emerge in the first place?

51:58.950 --> 52:05.970
This is a much more mysterious fact than the question which asked about things the other way around.

52:07.980 --> 52:15.450
From the point of view of idealism, it becomes clear why the pervading and almost irresistible desire

52:15.870 --> 52:22.970
to reduce everything to deterministic path of point particles is simply another sense.

52:22.980 --> 52:30.930
Mind reification in us and does not represent an inherent aspect of reality as it is.

52:32.220 --> 52:40.530
The very notion of a particle is a conceptual entity that arises due to a cognitive mental act of distinction

52:40.530 --> 52:50.070
and separation that points dots on a mental screen of consciousness due to the interpretation of a sensorial

52:50.070 --> 52:50.880
datastream.

52:52.430 --> 52:57.050
But this is already a fiction created by a state of mind.

52:58.000 --> 53:05.260
And a representation arising in our conscious experience and must not be mistaken for the inherent reality

53:05.260 --> 53:05.890
of things.

53:07.370 --> 53:15.650
Quantum uncertainty is a natural state of being, of things which become defined and determinant only

53:15.650 --> 53:22.460
at the instant of the experimental measure, which is always and inevitably a mapping into a mental

53:22.460 --> 53:27.890
representation based on distinction, reduction, division and separation.

53:29.720 --> 53:36.620
We must come to the conclusion that just as we can't describe the physiology of a person's body by looking

53:36.620 --> 53:44.740
at the shadow that the body projects, so can physics describe the inherent truth of things like Espin,

53:45.050 --> 53:53.120
a path in spacetime, the position of a particle, or the notion of a particle itself as they are independent

53:53.120 --> 54:00.440
of our sensorial perceptions and mental constructions, which are built up in abstractions that are

54:00.440 --> 54:06.260
in turn based on the other sensory data and cognitive constructs.

54:08.490 --> 54:14.850
The world we perceive is a symbol, everything we perceive is a symbol of what is experienced.

54:16.180 --> 54:23.440
The question is no longer why microscopic things appear to be uncertain and resist being cast into a

54:23.440 --> 54:32.110
reductionist worldview, but rather why an intrinsically undifferentiated whole allows itself to be

54:32.110 --> 54:41.080
reduced to what we perceive at the macroscopic scale as being an extremely fragmented and definite reality.

54:43.200 --> 54:50.970
Another intimately related question is, why should we regard quantum physics as a source of idealistic

54:50.970 --> 54:51.920
considerations?

54:52.200 --> 54:57.960
After all, this is a philosophical school of thought that existed long before the inception of quantum

54:57.960 --> 54:58.830
physics itself.

54:58.830 --> 55:07.110
As I already underlined and pointed out, since the times of ancient Greece, philosophers questioned

55:07.110 --> 55:10.080
what reality is and the fundamental essence of things.

55:11.040 --> 55:17.850
Philosophical idealism can also be discussed and defended inside a purely Newtonian paradigm, and one

55:17.850 --> 55:20.130
does not need to resort to quantum mechanics.

55:21.880 --> 55:28.690
The point, however, is that quantum mechanics let us a step further or many more steps further, I

55:28.690 --> 55:37.000
would say, by confronting us with facts that clearly evidence how mental abstractions and constructions

55:37.300 --> 55:45.220
are tools for practical purposes, but not represent not are not representations of an inherent reality.

55:47.190 --> 55:55.380
Previously, we could still delude ourselves into regarding the appearances of the permanence and solidity

55:55.410 --> 56:03.540
of a deterministic and predictable clockwork universe as the ultimately true properties that built up

56:03.540 --> 56:11.910
and in here and in inherent in intrinsic reality, independent of our subjective perceptions and conceptions

56:12.570 --> 56:20.250
of Newtonian mechanics and also Einstein's relativity are still in line with these unaware assumptions

56:20.490 --> 56:26.880
and idealism seemed to be a distant philosophical remnant or romanticism.

56:28.770 --> 56:36.750
However, if quantum mechanics is taken seriously, that is not just as a calculation tool or a theory

56:36.750 --> 56:45.060
that we would like to see fall back to a naive Newtonian or Einsteinian deterministic realism, then

56:45.240 --> 56:50.280
philosophical idealism in one form or another is inescapable.
