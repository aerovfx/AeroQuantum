00:00.640 --> 00:09.280
In quantum mechanics, one is usually more concerned with single particles or many particle systems

00:09.280 --> 00:11.500
than with extended bodies.

00:12.730 --> 00:17.530
So what about elementary particles like electrons?

00:17.950 --> 00:27.790
When it comes to the notion of the angular momentum, it is not difficult to extend the notion of the

00:27.790 --> 00:34.730
orbital angular momentum of a material particle having a mass like, for example, the electron.

00:34.870 --> 00:45.310
In the case we conceived of it in Bors atomic model as a particle flying around the atoms nucleus.

00:47.070 --> 00:56.490
This conception is dubious enough because we should actually have in mind the atomic orbital model not.

00:57.960 --> 01:06.750
Borse atomic model, but the orbital atomic model that in any event, so far, this picture of reality,

01:06.750 --> 01:11.030
that, of course, atomic model to some degree still works.

01:12.330 --> 01:20.060
And here the orbital angular momentum of the electron can be defined as the product of its mass times

01:20.160 --> 01:28.500
velocity at which we imagine, believe it to orbit the nucleus times, the orbital distance from it

01:29.430 --> 01:35.720
according to the formula we have defined in the previous lecture.

01:37.520 --> 01:46.300
However, this is where the analogies to the classical world, uh, finish, they they end here.

01:47.780 --> 01:57.230
In fact, what about the spin that is what in quantum mechanics is called the the intrinsic angular

01:57.230 --> 02:06.350
momentum of a particle rotating around an axis that goes through its center, as in the case of the

02:06.350 --> 02:06.710
earth?

02:08.210 --> 02:16.430
The problem is this analogy analogy breaks down because we think of so-called elementary particles as

02:16.430 --> 02:19.100
a mathematical point like objects.

02:20.330 --> 02:26.630
Thus, it becomes somewhat unclear what the spin of a points structure should mean at all.

02:27.610 --> 02:36.880
What is a point that spins around itself into it intuitively and even mathematically, it doesn't make

02:36.880 --> 02:37.700
much sense.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.970
So either electrons are not point like.

02:43.690 --> 02:52.810
But no experiment has so far revealed any internal structure, at least not as of 2019, where I'm speaking

02:52.810 --> 02:53.080
now.

02:54.910 --> 03:02.740
Or we must consider the notion of the spin of particles in quantum mechanics as something that must

03:02.740 --> 03:05.770
not be viewed as we do intuitively.

03:06.330 --> 03:07.780
The macroscopic scale.

03:08.860 --> 03:15.550
For this reason, in quantum mechanics, one more loosely speaks of particles carrying an intrinsic

03:15.730 --> 03:23.320
momentum, intrinsic angular momentum or spin simply without suggesting literally the the image of a

03:23.320 --> 03:26.650
spinning sphere, as in a classical theory.

03:28.590 --> 03:36.810
And yet we know that even elementary particles, such electrons or protons and neutrons, well, protons

03:36.810 --> 03:42.450
and neutrons are not really elementary because we know nowadays they are composed of so-called quarks.

03:42.970 --> 03:50.100
But in any event, that also these particles have a tiny but measurable spin.

03:51.510 --> 03:57.030
Can the spin of a particle as tiny as an electron be measured?

03:58.290 --> 04:00.930
The answer is positive and even surprising.

04:01.710 --> 04:06.900
It is possible to measure and associate a spin to elementary particles.

04:07.800 --> 04:17.310
The interesting point is that as we saw energy being quantized in quantum mechanics, the spin also

04:17.670 --> 04:21.390
of particles, this also turns out to be quantized.

04:23.010 --> 04:30.870
Nature allows only discrete, not continuous quantities of intrinsic angular momentum spin.

04:31.110 --> 04:37.050
Therefore, in quantum mechanics is a quantized dynamical property of all particles.

04:38.960 --> 04:44.730
How physicists reached this conclusion will be elucidated now.

04:44.750 --> 04:51.840
We will explain this now with the so-called Stand Galla experiment.

04:53.030 --> 04:59.840
It is easier to understand how this works if we first introduce some basics and anticipate some of the

04:59.840 --> 05:00.530
results.

05:02.770 --> 05:11.590
For elementary particles, the spin has only two possible values if we take as a convention the vertical

05:11.590 --> 05:22.510
axis being the upward set axis, we can show experimentally that, say, an electron or a photon has

05:22.510 --> 05:30.820
only two possible spins along that axis, a fixed specific amount of spin up or spin down states.

05:32.080 --> 05:39.880
We will never, ever observe the electron having other amounts of spin and being directed towards another

05:39.880 --> 05:41.260
direction in between.

05:43.100 --> 05:50.630
Or if you would like to stick to the classical intuitive understanding, elementary particles rotate

05:50.630 --> 05:58.610
clockwise or counterclockwise around an axis, always with the same angular frequency.

06:01.700 --> 06:08.480
What must be added to this picture is the fact that we should not forget that several particles like

06:08.480 --> 06:14.230
electrons and protons are electrical, electrically charged particles.

06:14.390 --> 06:21.260
They have an electric charge where neutrons and not the fact as such.

06:21.410 --> 06:28.760
But internally, the internal structure of a neutron is made of quarks again, and these have an electric

06:28.760 --> 06:29.200
charge.

06:29.210 --> 06:35.450
So from the outside, a neutron is seen as not being electric charge.

06:35.450 --> 06:36.500
But this is another matter.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.750
Let's focus on electrons.

06:38.750 --> 06:43.750
Eventually they all possess an equal.

06:44.180 --> 06:54.050
So electrons, protons possess an equal tiny charge, which is also taken as the elementary electric

06:54.050 --> 07:08.060
charge leveled with a small letter E which amounts to E equals one point six to a six seven two times

07:08.510 --> 07:19.970
the power of ten to the minus 19 km where the letter C stands in fact for Coulomb and is the standard

07:19.970 --> 07:23.150
international unit for the electric charge.

07:24.530 --> 07:31.490
This is the number E should not be confused with the oil, a number, which is a completely different

07:31.490 --> 07:37.020
thing, of course, at this elementary charge.

07:37.370 --> 07:39.530
Is an extremely small charge.

07:40.160 --> 07:48.260
For example, a typical household electric device, say, is more lamp that works with an electric current

07:48.260 --> 07:49.400
of one ampere.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.660
Ampere stands for a.

07:55.450 --> 08:02.400
For the unit of the intensity of an electric current that you probably have also noticed in your household

08:02.670 --> 08:05.730
as something of the order of six times.

08:07.400 --> 08:18.890
Ten to the power, 18, 18, which means six quintillion electrons, six billions of billions of electrons

08:18.890 --> 08:25.280
per second flowing through this, the secretary of the small lamp.

08:26.150 --> 08:32.960
So you can imagine that the charge and the end of an electron and the electron itself is an extremely

08:33.200 --> 08:34.650
small object.

08:35.570 --> 08:43.310
However, despite its small value, the electric charge of an electron can be measured using relatively

08:43.310 --> 08:48.810
simple consideration and consideration and experimental arrangements.

08:49.010 --> 08:58.580
Well, not so simple, but they believe this could be already measured in the beginning of the first

08:58.580 --> 09:01.460
of the last half of the last century.

09:01.730 --> 09:11.480
In fact, electrically charged particles produce an electric field in the surrounding space around an

09:11.480 --> 09:13.710
electric charge, their electric field.

09:13.790 --> 09:17.000
Otherwise the definition you would not have an electric charge.

09:17.300 --> 09:26.360
And this interacts with other charged particles or also with other magnetic fields.

09:27.890 --> 09:34.640
These electric fees are graphically shown with the field lines in case of a positive charge.

09:35.180 --> 09:42.230
Uh, the lines are directed outwards and for negative charges inward.

09:43.500 --> 09:53.550
The stronger a field is in general and is, the denser the field lines are represented also for other

09:53.550 --> 09:58.480
types of fields like the magnetic fields, the gravitational field or whatever.

10:00.330 --> 10:07.980
Just to add another example, similarly for the interaction of two positive electric charges, one obtains

10:08.490 --> 10:09.930
pictures like these.

10:11.040 --> 10:15.920
These are, however, only pictorial representations.

10:15.930 --> 10:21.450
You must not consider these lines as being really existing objects out there.

10:22.110 --> 10:29.760
They just represent the intensity and of the field and the direction in which the forces of these fields

10:30.510 --> 10:30.950
act.

10:31.710 --> 10:39.840
They are, however, in any case and aid for our mind to represent the strength and structure of a field.

10:41.910 --> 10:46.480
Electric charges are also themselves the source of magnetic fields.

10:47.610 --> 10:56.130
In fact, it is a simple law of nature that every moving electrically electrically charged particle

10:56.490 --> 11:00.090
always produces a corresponding magnetic field.

11:01.560 --> 11:08.430
For example, also a cable through which an electric current that is electrons flow will also manifest

11:08.430 --> 11:09.400
a magnetic field.

11:10.770 --> 11:14.610
This is always true and is fundamental, a fundamental physics.

11:14.610 --> 11:21.870
Wherever electric particles travel throughout space or through a conductor, there will always produce

11:21.870 --> 11:22.910
a magnetic field.

11:24.540 --> 11:33.690
The construction of electromagnets, for example, relies on this principle, a loop of electric current,

11:33.900 --> 11:42.690
a bar magnet, an electron, a molecule, and the planet always have magnetic moments as they all contain

11:42.690 --> 11:47.390
in one form or another, circulating electric charges.

11:48.970 --> 11:56.860
This is something we imagine also happening with the earth's magnetic field, the earth's interior must

11:56.860 --> 12:05.350
contain a huge amount of magma, of hot currents, of magma fluid, which is electrically charge charged,

12:06.430 --> 12:14.170
and therefore its movement around the earth's axis causes the earth, the Earth's magnetic field, to

12:14.170 --> 12:14.680
build up.

12:16.840 --> 12:24.820
However, the interesting point is that also the opposite is true as well, wherever a magnetic field

12:25.210 --> 12:27.100
changes in time.

12:28.050 --> 12:30.420
An electric field will appear.

12:31.400 --> 12:38.150
This is what we already hinted at when discussing the nature of light as an oscillating electromagnetic

12:38.150 --> 12:45.530
field, and it is at the foundation of Maxwell's equations.

12:47.420 --> 12:56.990
Therefore, an electrically charged spinning object is also expected to display some magnetic field

12:57.920 --> 13:01.130
as it is a charge in rotation rotational movement.

13:03.020 --> 13:12.320
And because only to fix spin states are possible, the result is also that only two magnetic moments

13:13.220 --> 13:19.250
with the magnetic field lines directed in one or the other direction, according to the Spin's, particle

13:19.250 --> 13:21.860
orientations are possible.

13:23.390 --> 13:30.080
The magnetic moment of a magnet is a physical quantity that tells us how strong the magnet is, more

13:30.080 --> 13:37.940
precisely, it is a vector quantity which determines the talk to you that the magnet here, the particle

13:38.420 --> 13:44.900
will experience in the presence of another external external magnetic field.

13:45.700 --> 13:54.910
Say some produced in the laboratory with electromagnets, and if we can measure a particles magnetic

13:54.910 --> 14:02.710
moment, we can be sure that it possesses a spin and therefore we can evaluate its magnitude.

14:04.600 --> 14:12.280
Of course, because the spins of quantum objects are quantized, the same must hold for its magnetic

14:12.280 --> 14:12.730
moment.

14:13.780 --> 14:22.090
Electrons and protons therefore have only two magnetic moments due to their corresponding spin as equals

14:22.090 --> 14:28.930
plus minus half one half, which are accordingly labelled as M.

14:28.930 --> 14:36.940
S equals plus minus one half Y half integers and not plus minus one.

14:37.570 --> 14:39.460
Well, we will see this later.

14:41.690 --> 14:50.780
This approach, this is precisely this is an experimental approach is precisely what in 1922, the German

14:50.780 --> 14:57.980
physicists, Otterton and Walter Gaila were able to demonstrate.

14:59.200 --> 15:06.820
In particular, they showed they showed this, first of all, on Adams and Silver items, but this can

15:06.820 --> 15:14.470
be used also to this day that they are technique, I mean, can be used also to show the existence of

15:14.800 --> 15:20.160
intrinsic angular momentum, of momentum of single particles.

15:21.490 --> 15:28.720
This D'Angela experimental set up from now on, let's just label it as G.

15:29.050 --> 15:34.990
O or S.G. experimental setup was constructed as follows.

15:37.540 --> 15:40.840
They sent a beam of silver atoms and they said.

15:41.920 --> 15:51.810
Previously prepared in a source of head at hot items, in that case using a furnace and column column

15:51.830 --> 16:01.870
into the beam of outcoming atoms by Haslet sending it through and in homogeneous magnetic field created

16:01.870 --> 16:09.760
by magnets that had a special form and orientation of the sort seen in this figure here.

16:11.540 --> 16:19.850
The choice of silver atoms was due only to practical considerations, silver atoms are easier to handle

16:19.850 --> 16:24.000
and have only one unpaired electron and the outer atomic shell.

16:24.680 --> 16:33.380
Why the electric and magnetic properties due to all the other inert electrons are canceled out mutually

16:33.960 --> 16:38.930
will explain this further when we are dealing with the Pauli exclusion principle.

16:40.190 --> 16:47.540
Therefore, the measurement of the magnetic momentum of a solar silver atom reduces to that of one single

16:47.540 --> 16:49.250
outer shell electron.

16:51.290 --> 17:00.440
Now, when an atom or a particle or whatever object that has a magnetic moment is sent through an inner

17:00.440 --> 17:10.070
homogeneous magnetic field, it experiences a force and therefore is deviated in one or the other direction,

17:10.400 --> 17:14.450
relatively relative to the poles of the magnet.

17:14.990 --> 17:23.660
That is relative to the direction of the magnetic lines and according to the orientation of its own

17:23.660 --> 17:25.010
magnetic moment.

17:26.890 --> 17:36.430
It is quite intuitive to understand why this must be so, just as a couple of magnets must repel or

17:36.430 --> 17:37.780
attract each other.

17:38.800 --> 17:49.990
The stangl, the the S.G. magnet and the particles or atoms which are also tiny magnets, must mutually

17:50.290 --> 17:59.110
repel or attract each other according to the directions of their magnetic polarities.

18:00.720 --> 18:07.920
That is, if one sends the particle, which has a spin up, say, preconvention relative to the Z axis

18:08.700 --> 18:16.860
through the S.G. device with its north south magnetic poles directed along the that Z axis, it will

18:16.860 --> 18:19.530
be activated upwards.

18:20.550 --> 18:25.350
On the other hand, the spin down particle will be activated downwards.

18:26.460 --> 18:34.800
And if the magnetic moment of quantum particles is indeed quantized, in only two possible states,

18:35.520 --> 18:43.980
we will observe only an up or down deviation in the S.G. experiment, which must therefore create two

18:43.980 --> 18:50.070
distinct spots on a detecting screen that the particles strike.

18:53.150 --> 19:01.280
Otherwise, if the magnetic moment were continuous, that is would not be a discrete physical property

19:01.280 --> 19:10.700
of particles, the deviation of the S.G. magnets induced on the particles would also be continuous,

19:11.510 --> 19:18.120
producing instead a continuous line on the detection screen, as expected by classical physics.

19:20.000 --> 19:27.410
This was a conceptually simple method of showing that atoms and particles indeed possess a quantized,

19:27.410 --> 19:33.470
intrinsic, angular momentum, Stan and Galla observed.

19:33.920 --> 19:41.480
Always and only the binary possibility, the binary outcome, not the expected classical results.

19:43.040 --> 19:49.730
What they showed with this is that the quantization quantization of spin is not simply speculation,

19:49.970 --> 19:53.630
but an established experimental fact.

19:56.160 --> 20:05.070
Before we discuss other interesting discoveries one can make with devices, let us fix this first result

20:05.160 --> 20:11.040
with the Dirac Dirac notation we discussed in the lecture on the State Vector's.

20:12.870 --> 20:20.280
The two possible spin states could be labeled with the cat plus and minus symbols.

20:21.890 --> 20:29.450
If not further specified, it is convention usually to assume that these states are measured against

20:30.440 --> 20:36.140
whatever axis or the standard that axis of the laboratory.

20:38.420 --> 20:44.810
Just for the record, keep in mind that in the literature, you might find also other symbolic conventions

20:44.810 --> 20:55.880
like these, the plus minus get as that or Keat as that semicolon plus minus and so on, especially

20:55.880 --> 21:01.630
when it is important to distinguish them from the other X and Y directions.

21:02.030 --> 21:11.110
And we will use the first ones, however, because there is no universal standard convention, uh,

21:11.300 --> 21:20.630
in this regard, please learn to be flexible enough to read the symbols that we use interchangeably

21:20.630 --> 21:24.290
according to the context and the literature.

21:26.270 --> 21:33.260
The important point in any in any in any case is to keep in mind here is that the Tangela experiments

21:33.560 --> 21:41.520
can easily show that the quantize character of the spin does not change, even with a change in the

21:41.540 --> 21:44.540
direction along which the measurement is taken.

21:45.620 --> 21:53.840
Whatever axis you choose in a three dimensional space, you will always get as a result of the measurement,

21:53.840 --> 21:55.420
a spin up or spin down.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.560
That means a.

21:57.500 --> 22:03.780
Kate, plus or minus particle, as strange as that might seem.

22:04.520 --> 22:11.720
The fact is, in the quantum world, there is no longer such a thing that can mostly worry its spinning

22:11.720 --> 22:20.090
direction, interpretation of speed as we imagine it, for example, with spinning top or spinning billiard

22:20.090 --> 22:20.410
balls.

22:21.210 --> 22:27.170
Instead, we have a quantum objects, which once a direction has been chosen.

22:28.440 --> 22:34.570
Can acquire or display only two possible spin states along that direction.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.450
Nothing in between.

22:38.750 --> 22:47.420
In physics, one formalizes this with an elegant formalism that puts all three Igen states, that is

22:47.420 --> 22:53.990
the spin state vector's along a preferred that axis into one single description.

22:55.740 --> 23:02.010
For the sake of simplicity, let us restrict ourselves to the that explain.

23:03.590 --> 23:11.780
Define a spin up and spin down along that that axis, as with the formalism reminiscent of vectors on

23:11.780 --> 23:21.500
a Cartesian Cartesian two dimensional plane as this one here where you have a dead cat plus equals a

23:21.500 --> 23:23.270
vector or.

23:24.460 --> 23:34.880
Something that we will now call Spiner one zero and that Kate minus equals at zero zero one Spiner.

23:35.410 --> 23:42.910
These are not really vectors and that's why they are called Spinous to distinguish them from the usual

23:43.270 --> 23:45.090
Cartesian vectors.

23:46.180 --> 23:54.760
In fact, note that these are not the Baz's vectors of the Cartesian two dimensional plane you learned

23:54.760 --> 24:08.050
about in school, or as we have also repeated for you, for you in the appendix videos of this course,

24:09.280 --> 24:16.530
because these were one zero for the Baz's vector along the x axis and zero one for the basis vector

24:16.540 --> 24:18.700
along the Y axis here.

24:18.720 --> 24:27.880
Instead, we are not speaking about a geometrical directions in space, but these represent directional

24:27.910 --> 24:31.780
spin directions in not a.

24:33.070 --> 24:41.710
Geometrics, three dimensional space that we live in with, we perceive with our senses, but so to

24:41.710 --> 24:46.390
speak, in a spin Spiner space.

24:48.060 --> 24:54.210
We are going to see later that spiders are quite different objects, therefore, and require a different

24:54.210 --> 25:01.130
treatment, that is to obey, they they obey other algebraic rules.

25:03.120 --> 25:12.000
The amount of intrinsic angular momentum or the spin can also be measured, one can relate it to the

25:12.000 --> 25:17.820
separation of the two spots on on the Stanzler screen.

25:19.520 --> 25:31.490
And it turns out that it is equal to plus minus each bar, half each bar being as usual, Planck's constant

25:32.060 --> 25:34.880
divided by two times pi.

25:36.320 --> 25:43.280
In fact, Planck's constant has the dimension of an angular momentum, by the way, if you consider

25:43.280 --> 25:52.550
that it is a value of the order of 10 to the PI, to the power minus 34 jowls per second.

25:53.610 --> 26:00.240
When we recall what we have said in the section on the black body radiation, we realize that it is

26:00.240 --> 26:05.450
an incredibly small but not zero amount of angular momentum.

26:08.000 --> 26:15.950
We have also seen how if a measurement on a particle takes place, this is represented in mathematical

26:15.950 --> 26:25.550
abstract terms by operators that we called observables acting in a Hilbert space on vector states.

26:26.330 --> 26:29.480
That is the case in the direct notation.

26:30.260 --> 26:39.350
On that occasion, we describe the measurement process by means of an operator Igen equation with an

26:39.350 --> 26:43.450
eigenvalue representing the measurement, the measured quantity.

26:44.450 --> 26:47.900
Go back to the previous one of the previous lecture.

26:47.900 --> 26:55.760
We have clarified this because the spin is a physical, measurable quantity it must have associated.

26:55.760 --> 26:59.840
Operator in this case it is the spin operator.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.600
Capital Letter S.

27:03.920 --> 27:12.560
A spin operator is also defined along one of the three dimensions of space, again, usually that directed

27:12.560 --> 27:15.590
along that axis as as Seth.

27:17.690 --> 27:27.200
And however, there is no reason to restrict ourselves to the measurement along one axis, three possible

27:27.200 --> 27:30.990
spinning directions exist in a three dimensional space.

27:31.520 --> 27:40.460
We can therefore also consider measuring the spin of an object along the other two X or Y spinning axis

27:40.700 --> 27:47.570
with associated operators as X and as Y, respectively.

27:49.120 --> 27:55.820
Recall that in quantum mechanics, every act of measurement represented by an operator, the observable,

27:55.840 --> 28:03.190
the observable of the physical property measured acts on a wave function or state vector and delivers

28:03.190 --> 28:12.490
the eigenvalue the quantity one measures through the eigenvalue equation translated in.

28:13.510 --> 28:22.030
To the spin, uh, turns, if the particle is in an Afghan state, the same state which will always

28:22.030 --> 28:29.890
turn out to be even after repeated measurements, the spin operator is acting on the eigenvector of

28:29.890 --> 28:32.400
an electron in a spin up or spin down.

28:32.590 --> 28:42.970
Can state therefore get plus minus the spin measurement of the Gallet device, for example, for all

28:42.970 --> 28:46.810
three axis is represented, as we have shown here.

28:48.060 --> 28:54.000
The measurement process along the Z axis is written with the operator as.

28:55.000 --> 28:55.840
As that.

28:56.740 --> 29:08.530
These operators that acting on the eigenvector that got caught plus and resulting in a plus h ba eigenvalue.

29:09.450 --> 29:18.630
The result of the measurement times that that get plus a vector itself, the same holds for the particles

29:18.630 --> 29:26.850
in spin down state both but with the opposite side and so on, measuring making the same measurement

29:26.850 --> 29:31.410
along the X axis is the same thing in principle only.

29:31.710 --> 29:39.540
You have to remember that you are using another observable, namely you are making a different measurement

29:39.540 --> 29:40.410
than that.

29:40.620 --> 29:48.690
But you're making a measurement with the operator as X onto a particle along X direction.

29:48.700 --> 29:58.260
Therefore you're presented with operator s X acting on the X Kate plus minus vector, which again as

29:58.500 --> 30:06.740
being an eigenvalue equation, results in plus minus eight times the same vector and so on also for

30:06.750 --> 30:09.060
the x y axis and so on.

30:11.440 --> 30:18.250
However, generally speaking, the outcome is not known, and the probability of finding the particle

30:18.250 --> 30:25.480
in one or the other state is usually 50 percent if it is not in an angry state.

30:27.250 --> 30:33.610
We have learned that the probability of finding the system in a specific igan state is encoded in the

30:33.640 --> 30:41.680
in the coefficients of the state vector, which contains all the possible states in which a system can

30:41.680 --> 30:41.940
be.

30:43.060 --> 30:47.020
Therefore, the spin state of an electron is written.

30:47.410 --> 30:52.730
The spin the vector state is a quantum vector state of.

30:54.600 --> 31:03.180
Particle like an electron in a specific, non determined spin state, which is not the Igan State spin

31:03.180 --> 31:06.360
state, is written as follows.

31:06.980 --> 31:11.080
And here we omit for sake of simplicity the axis level.

31:11.310 --> 31:14.160
Just imagine them according to one direction.

31:15.270 --> 31:15.900
Um.

31:16.970 --> 31:21.350
Let us closely inspect the state vector equation, the cat.

31:22.890 --> 31:29.170
Sigh is not or not necessarily the state in which the particle is observed to be.

31:30.270 --> 31:40.290
It is a state before the measurement and comprises all possible outcomes, we might say that it describes

31:40.290 --> 31:42.810
a potentiality of realization.

31:43.740 --> 31:51.960
Because for an elementary particle like an electron, only two possible measurement outcomes exist for

31:51.960 --> 32:00.900
the spin states, namely the net plus or minus I can state and because there is no reason to believe

32:00.900 --> 32:03.540
that nature prefers one over the other.

32:04.560 --> 32:07.500
And in fact, measurements show that it is not.

32:07.740 --> 32:15.780
It is so they must both have an equal 50 percent probability of being measured.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.480
That is of being realized.

32:19.110 --> 32:28.110
It is an easy fact that one can determine by measuring how intense the spots on the screen are.

32:31.610 --> 32:41.240
So this probability is encoded in the coefficients one over the square to, in fact recall that the

32:41.240 --> 32:48.380
squared models of these coefficients furnishes us with the probability of observing one or the other

32:48.650 --> 32:57.910
associated igan states realized by the measurement process here, the model square of one over the square

32:57.910 --> 33:06.260
of two is just one half, which means zero point five and which means 50 percent each.

33:07.480 --> 33:13.750
These coefficients, that is the model, the square of one over the square root of two.

33:14.410 --> 33:20.930
They are summed up together because before the measurement, we do not know which of the two will emerge.

33:21.160 --> 33:25.120
And in quantum mechanics, you imagine that both.

33:26.040 --> 33:26.790
State's.

33:28.030 --> 33:36.220
Are in potential of existence, so to speak, and to be realized, but only at a time where you make

33:36.220 --> 33:42.370
your measurement, that is only at the time where you apply your operator?

33:42.790 --> 33:49.350
S capital letter s on the eigenvector get BPCI.

33:51.560 --> 33:58.490
In general, the igan equation for spin, for the spin of the quantum system can be described by this

33:58.490 --> 34:00.410
more general agan equation.

34:02.950 --> 34:10.600
These equations with its coefficients are one of the most typical equations you will find in most every

34:10.600 --> 34:18.520
treatise on quantum physics and will follow us throughout this journey in one form or another.

34:18.970 --> 34:27.580
So with these fundamentals in mind, we can discuss other revealing experiments that one can perform

34:27.820 --> 34:30.910
with Stan Galla devices.
