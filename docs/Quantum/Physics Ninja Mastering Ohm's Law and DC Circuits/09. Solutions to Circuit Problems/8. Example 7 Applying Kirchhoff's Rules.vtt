00:00.570 --> 00:03.450
All right here's a multi loop problem.

00:03.570 --> 00:06.590
Probably the hardest one we've got so far.

00:06.820 --> 00:08.730
It says find the current Each branch.

00:08.730 --> 00:10.750
Now I've given you some labels here.

00:10.980 --> 00:12.600
You choose to use those or not.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.430
It's kind of up to you.

00:14.760 --> 00:17.010
So how do we find the current and branch well.

00:17.040 --> 00:19.220
We have to apply our rules.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.160
We have Kirchhoff's rules we have a junction rule.

00:22.410 --> 00:27.510
There's two junctions in this problem we can either use junction B or drunks and C we're going to get

00:27.510 --> 00:28.880
the same answer.

00:29.260 --> 00:33.600
So let's go ahead and write junction B what is the junction rule says whatever current flows into the

00:33.600 --> 00:37.290
junction has to be equal to the current flowing out.

00:37.320 --> 00:44.450
So we have I going into the junction that must be equal to one plus two.

00:44.600 --> 00:49.950
The way I've got them labeled there I want an IDE to leave the junction I goes into it and I call this

00:49.950 --> 00:51.960
equation 1.

00:52.020 --> 00:55.350
Now all we can do is we can do some loops.

00:55.650 --> 01:03.470
What I'm going to do first is I'm going to do a loop around this kind of smaller left side.

01:03.770 --> 01:08.250
I'm going to start at point F and I'm going to go around here in a clockwise fashion.

01:08.250 --> 01:13.210
So if I start at point f the first thing I encounter here is a 12 volt battery.

01:13.350 --> 01:16.260
So I get plus 12.

01:16.260 --> 01:17.260
Now nothing happens.

01:17.270 --> 01:18.090
I get to Point B.

01:18.090 --> 01:25.440
Now I'm going to go through this four ohm resistor so I get a voltage drop of four multiplied by the

01:25.440 --> 01:29.430
current flowing through that we've called that I won.

01:29.460 --> 01:35.710
Now I go to point E and I'm going to cross a three ohm resistor in the direction of the current negative

01:35.750 --> 01:39.150
voltage drop equal to three multiplied by the current.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.260
Careful these are different from each other now.

01:41.660 --> 01:45.670
I go back to point f that must be equal to zero.

01:46.100 --> 01:55.910
Let's call this equation to know for Equation 3 to go around the big loop go around the outside.

01:56.180 --> 01:58.770
Again we're going to start at point f.

01:59.660 --> 02:05.030
So the first part looks the same you get plus 12.

02:05.030 --> 02:06.470
The voltage of the battery.

02:06.470 --> 02:09.370
Now I'm going across a tool resistor.

02:09.700 --> 02:15.330
I get minus two multiplied by the current flowing through that guy it's Aitu.

02:15.490 --> 02:16.280
Now look what happened.

02:16.280 --> 02:20.760
Now I'm crossing a battery and I'm going from the positive to the negative side.

02:21.100 --> 02:30.430
So I get a voltage drop equal to the voltage of the battery and the last part now is minus three multiplied

02:30.430 --> 02:32.130
by the current That's the voltage drop.

02:32.140 --> 02:34.960
That's the same term as what I had in the equation.

02:35.370 --> 02:39.790
I go back to point f that's what I get.

02:39.790 --> 02:45.880
Now it could have gone and made another equation if I wanted to I could have gone through and either

02:45.880 --> 02:49.290
go clockwise or counterclockwise it doesn't really matter.

02:49.430 --> 02:55.510
And you went around like this you could have done that we can write down that equation.

02:55.570 --> 02:57.390
Since we're practicing here.

02:57.730 --> 02:59.190
So let's go around the same thing.

02:59.210 --> 03:05.260
First thing I encounter is that 2 ohm resistor that should be the same two times Aitu the voltage drop

03:06.220 --> 03:08.460
minus five.

03:08.470 --> 03:13.780
Now the only difference is when I'm going through this forum resistor in this case I'm going in the

03:13.870 --> 03:15.670
opposite direction of the current.

03:15.910 --> 03:22.920
So I have to have a potential gain now of four multiplied by one that equals to zero.

03:23.590 --> 03:25.120
So we have three unknowns.

03:25.150 --> 03:31.030
We have the current I have a one and we have two really.

03:31.120 --> 03:37.280
All we require to solve this are three equations.

03:37.380 --> 03:39.850
Right now we have four equations.

03:39.870 --> 03:48.140
However it turns out that the last one it doesn't give us any new information because I could have got

03:48.140 --> 03:58.440
this last equation if I simply would of taking the difference between equation 2 and Equation 3.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.700
Check it out for yourself right.

03:59.700 --> 04:03.420
If you take the difference between both of those what are you going to get the 12 volts are going to

04:03.420 --> 04:07.630
cancel out you're going to get minus four.

04:07.630 --> 04:16.660
I wonder you're going to get the minus three ones are going to cancel out or minus three times.

04:16.660 --> 04:22.830
I rather if I take the difference you're going to get plus five and you're going to get plus two.

04:22.840 --> 04:27.310
So at the end you're going to get the exact same equation except the signs are going to be flipped around.

04:27.310 --> 04:33.680
But if I would it did equation three minus equation too then I would have gotten the exact same.

04:33.760 --> 04:42.970
Or you could check it out minus two Aitu minus five and then plus four times I won OK.

04:43.230 --> 04:46.730
So we really don't get any new information from this equation.

04:46.740 --> 04:48.350
You can use it if you want it doesn't matter.

04:48.350 --> 04:56.760
But we really need to use at least the first three equations in order to solve what the currents are.

04:56.880 --> 05:04.170
You could substitute equation to an equation 3 for equation for whichever one you choose.

05:04.170 --> 05:08.820
All right so at this point now we just kind of get rid of that and discuss this enough.

05:08.820 --> 05:11.570
Let's just how do we get down to the algebra.

05:11.570 --> 05:14.210
Now all of the physics is actually done.

05:14.280 --> 05:20.180
All you have to do now is kind of manipulate these equations in order to solve the currents.

05:20.410 --> 05:25.630
It's a little bit tricky but the way I like to do it is I'm going to keep the first equation as is and

05:25.740 --> 05:29.130
what I'm going to try to do now is eliminate the currents.

05:29.130 --> 05:32.470
I want an aitu.

05:32.760 --> 05:36.610
Can I write both of these only in terms of I.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.900
Well in order to do that I'm going to use equation too.

05:39.930 --> 05:41.360
So let me write two over here.

05:41.610 --> 05:45.930
And what we're going to do is we're going to write I want in terms of I.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.590
So if I can rewrite this I'm going to get four.

05:48.590 --> 05:54.320
One has to be equal so for I want to get that by bringing it on the other side.

05:54.570 --> 05:58.560
This is simply 12 minus three times.

05:59.370 --> 06:06.990
Now if you divide through by 4 and get rid of it over here if I divide through by 4 what I'm going to

06:06.990 --> 06:12.990
end up getting is three minus three fourths multiplied by.

06:12.990 --> 06:18.570
And that's the equation I get for I 1 from equation 3 I can do something very very similar.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.830
I'm going to isolate what I 2 is.

06:21.030 --> 06:30.110
So I get to Aitu going to be equal to Looks like 712 minus five is seven minus three times I.

06:30.570 --> 06:36.230
And at the end we're going to simply divide by divide by 2 bring the two down stairs.

06:37.200 --> 06:42.580
So I'm going to get seven over to minus three over two multiplied by.

06:42.930 --> 06:49.990
So now I've written I won and I too in terms of the current in this left most branch.

06:50.550 --> 06:54.660
So what you do now is you simply substitute into this equation and you get kind of a messy looking thing

06:54.690 --> 06:56.270
but it's just algebra.

06:56.580 --> 07:03.810
So you get i equals to and instead of writing I won I'm simply going to write three minus three over

07:03.810 --> 07:04.490
four times.

07:04.510 --> 07:07.590
I thought of writing Aitu.

07:07.910 --> 07:14.270
I simply write seven over two loops minus three over two multiplied by.

07:14.700 --> 07:20.550
Now you've got to group everything together and at the end do but a week's worth of math a lot that

07:20.620 --> 07:22.320
will let you do that for yourself.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.660
You should get that I's equal to two imps

07:28.460 --> 07:31.600
from the last equation I wrote over here.

07:31.610 --> 07:34.500
Now once you get that I's equal to two.

07:34.610 --> 07:35.450
Now guess what.

07:35.450 --> 07:41.450
Now you can go back you can go ahead and substitute that over here and solve for what I want is you

07:41.450 --> 07:47.220
can go ahead and substitute that into this equation and get what the current Aitu is.

07:47.930 --> 07:49.970
Let's go ahead and do that.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.900
So what you get is three minus three or four.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.040
And that's multiplied by two.

07:57.380 --> 08:04.520
That gives me three here I can factor out to three minus 1.5.

08:04.970 --> 08:07.400
Should give me 1.5 amps.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.190
That's my current one.

08:10.040 --> 08:18.920
And that automatically means that if this is three point five seven over two minus three over two multiplied

08:18.920 --> 08:25.370
by two we're left with zero point five is the current Aitu.

08:25.730 --> 08:28.830
And that makes a lot of sense where I live we have two amps going in.

08:28.940 --> 08:31.300
You've got 1.5 going over here.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.950
And actually I got 0.5 out of a small current going on this side over here.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.470
All right so now we basically solve the first part.

08:39.950 --> 08:46.140
All we have to do now is let's find the energy dissipated in this four ohm resistor.

08:46.220 --> 08:49.560
So what does the energy dissipated over here.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.620
Actually they're asking you in a certain amount of time or what you can first do for Part B is find

08:54.620 --> 08:59.210
the power you can find the rate at which energy is being dissipated.

08:59.240 --> 09:05.090
All right the power being dissipated in any resistor is the value of the resistance multiplied by the

09:05.090 --> 09:06.760
current flowing through it.

09:06.770 --> 09:08.580
And don't forget to square that.

09:09.050 --> 09:12.550
And that's the power that's the rate that's the number of Joules per second.

09:12.860 --> 09:18.300
So in three seconds then I can find how much total energy was dissipated.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.930
But let's first start by finding the power.

09:21.090 --> 09:23.630
So you get for here and now the current.

09:23.630 --> 09:29.340
I would just solve for that too.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.060
Oh except I got to be a little bit careful.

09:32.160 --> 09:41.120
It's I one that goes in there or almost a costly mistake over there and the current one is 1.5 that

09:41.120 --> 09:44.150
have Raddy 1.5 that's going to be hard to square that.

09:44.180 --> 09:48.440
If I read it it is three over two that I square that it's going to be a little bit easier for me to

09:48.440 --> 09:50.330
do the math.

09:50.330 --> 09:50.560
All right.

09:50.570 --> 09:58.940
So we get four multiplied three squared gives me nine and two squared gives me four.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.460
So you see those fours cancel out nicely.

10:01.490 --> 10:06.530
So the power dissipated is nine Watts in that resistor.

10:06.530 --> 10:11.890
And if you wanted to find the energy Now remember the power you want to find the energy in three seconds

10:11.900 --> 10:14.770
it's simply the power multiplied by the time.

10:15.560 --> 10:22.910
So in this case simply nine multiplied by three seconds we get twenty seven joules.

10:24.020 --> 10:29.910
That is the energy dissipated in this forum resistor in three seconds.

10:29.930 --> 10:30.460
OK.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.630
So again pretty straightforward.

10:33.090 --> 10:38.210
Matthew gets a little bit tedious when you have multi loop circuits so this is kind of probably as hard

10:38.210 --> 10:39.700
as you would get in kind of on a test.

10:39.710 --> 10:43.820
I would assume I mean it's you're not going to get four or five loops unless there is kind of a trick

10:43.820 --> 10:50.990
to simplify it but otherwise you can get kind of complicated algebra if you have fractions just be a

10:50.990 --> 10:55.700
little bit careful with setting up the physics we should have that down.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.770
Don't forget our power relationships.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.580
That's all there is to it.
