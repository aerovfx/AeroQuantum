00:00.750 --> 00:04.910
All right here's our first problem here that kind of involves a whole series of questions related to

00:05.010 --> 00:09.840
kind of a full circuit which involves parallel and series combinations.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.250
So the first question is well first it says that the switch one is open.

00:13.290 --> 00:18.360
So there's going to be no current up here and then switch to is close so let me go ahead and draw wire

00:18.360 --> 00:20.830
here that connects both of those.

00:20.860 --> 00:21.260
OK.

00:21.390 --> 00:24.490
First thing is what is the equivalent resistance of this circuit.

00:24.660 --> 00:29.550
Well the first thing we're going to do is first we're going to combine both of those are there in parallel

00:29.550 --> 00:30.880
with each other.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.780
If I combine both of those.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.810
Maybe you just write it up over here.

00:36.030 --> 00:38.980
I'm just going to use my trick because there's only two of them.

00:39.150 --> 00:43.690
And all you have to do for that is you multiply them and you divide it by the sum.

00:44.010 --> 00:52.140
And what you find over here again 18 goes into six three times and 12 goes and three four times.

00:52.290 --> 00:59.840
We have basically an equivalent resistance here of four ohms that's everything here in the orange box.

00:59.850 --> 01:04.980
Now the other thing we need is we need to combine this four ohm resistor with a two old resistor and

01:04.980 --> 01:07.270
those are in series with each other.

01:07.590 --> 01:15.770
So our total is the equivalent to simply two plus four which gives me six ohms.

01:16.240 --> 01:16.550
OK.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.660
What's the current Now in this MF effort through the earmuffs source again what we've done now is we

01:21.660 --> 01:24.190
simply simplify this circuit over here.

01:26.510 --> 01:27.790
Into something like this.

01:27.830 --> 01:33.950
This is still an 18 volt power supply and this is my equivalent what I've called our total here which

01:33.950 --> 01:35.270
is 6 ohms.

01:35.660 --> 01:43.310
So automatically you can write down ohms law for this simple circuit in the current simply 18 over 6

01:43.310 --> 01:45.770
which should give me 3 amps.

01:45.770 --> 01:51.770
So that means you have 3 amps over here you have three amps over in this section you have three amps

01:51.770 --> 01:54.310
flowing through this tube and resistor.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.620
OK so we've got both of those.

01:56.630 --> 01:59.550
What's the potential drop now across each resistor.

01:59.870 --> 02:03.290
Well that's basically just applying ohms law to each resistor.

02:03.290 --> 02:03.930
Right.

02:03.950 --> 02:09.320
So for Part C we can do that immediately for this to ohm resistor because the potential drop across

02:09.320 --> 02:15.340
the resistor is simply going to be the value of the resistance times the current which is two times

02:15.500 --> 02:20.300
it's going ahead of myself two times three three was the current flowing through it.

02:20.360 --> 02:21.850
That gives me six volts.

02:22.070 --> 02:26.200
So there's six volts between this point and that point.

02:26.210 --> 02:28.420
Now what about both of those.

02:28.610 --> 02:33.290
Now since these are in parallel we should know that the voltage across both of those have to be the

02:33.290 --> 02:35.110
same.

02:35.140 --> 02:37.220
So how do we get the value.

02:37.390 --> 02:42.340
Well again now if you look at this branch over on the left hand side if I could look at between this

02:42.340 --> 02:48.730
point and this point and I compare that to what's going on between this point and that point we basically

02:48.730 --> 02:51.990
have two branches here that are in parallel with each other.

02:52.420 --> 02:57.850
And one day we should know about that is that the voltage across both of those branches have to be the

02:57.850 --> 03:00.060
same OK.

03:00.500 --> 03:05.270
So let's just find with the voltages across both of these points.

03:05.540 --> 03:11.000
Well if we start down here at the bottom what do we do we first gain 18 when we crossed the battery

03:11.000 --> 03:11.960
and then what happens.

03:11.990 --> 03:15.470
We just said there's a voltage drop now of six volts.

03:15.830 --> 03:22.140
So the voltage difference between points A and Point B has to be 12 volts.

03:22.550 --> 03:27.770
And that also must be the voltage difference between Point C and point D.

03:28.130 --> 03:30.720
That just comes from the loop rule.

03:31.100 --> 03:32.470
So the voltage difference

03:36.530 --> 03:37.590
just call it.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.120
I don't know which we should call here.

03:40.730 --> 03:42.590
Again let's just apply the loop rule here.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.240
So what we would get is 18.

03:44.520 --> 03:47.520
Then we get minus 6 when we go across that resistor.

03:47.910 --> 03:50.540
And then that there has to be equal to VB.

03:50.930 --> 03:54.960
So you see that VB right away I can write the VB.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.950
Mine is V-A has to be equal to 12 volts.

03:59.300 --> 04:06.320
So that means that you have to have 12 volts across both of those across points C and point the point

04:06.320 --> 04:09.400
C is at a higher voltage than point D.

04:09.410 --> 04:16.380
So this here must also equal divisi mine VD must also be equal to 12 volts.

04:16.430 --> 04:16.860
OK.

04:17.030 --> 04:18.810
Here you gain 12 volts.

04:18.860 --> 04:21.040
Here you go down 12 volts.

04:21.050 --> 04:21.470
OK.

04:21.590 --> 04:25.570
Because the sum has to be equal to zero Appian.

04:25.850 --> 04:26.540
So what does that mean.

04:26.540 --> 04:27.810
So let's just write it all out then.

04:27.830 --> 04:34.580
I mean that the voltage is now across this 12 Olmer this there has to be 12 volts and it's also the

04:34.580 --> 04:38.090
voltage across the six ohm resistor.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.670
All right that's question see.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.680
Now what is the current through each resistor.

04:41.720 --> 04:46.130
We already know the current through the tube resistor that has to be 3 amps.

04:46.130 --> 04:51.530
How do you now get the current here across the 12 ohm and across the 6 ohm.

04:52.130 --> 04:53.390
Call that question D.

04:53.550 --> 04:59.930
Well if you automatically know what the voltage is we just said it's 12 volts across each one you can

04:59.930 --> 05:04.270
automatically just apply ohms law and find what is the current through each one.

05:04.280 --> 05:11.570
So for the 12 ohm resistor we have basically 12 equals to the value of the resistance times the current

05:11.570 --> 05:13.670
flowing through the 12 alarm resistor.

05:14.180 --> 05:19.840
So the current flowing through the 12 ohm resistor has to be one what else.

05:20.140 --> 05:23.130
Well we can also write a student a different color here.

05:23.180 --> 05:27.450
We also write that the voltage across the six ohm resistor is also 12.

05:27.800 --> 05:33.050
That must be equal to the value of the resistance multiplied by the current flowing through the 6 ohm

05:33.050 --> 05:34.080
resistor.

05:34.790 --> 05:40.160
So the current flowing through the six ohm resistor has to be equal to 12 over 6 which gives me two

05:40.160 --> 05:41.830
amps.

05:41.900 --> 05:46.700
You could have also used a junction rule over here because you know you have three going in you're going

05:46.700 --> 05:50.270
to have one going on this side you're going to have two going on this side.

05:50.270 --> 05:53.120
They have to sum up whatever current flows into the junction.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.520
Must be the current flowing out of the junction.

05:56.540 --> 05:57.110
All right good.

05:57.110 --> 05:58.860
We've got the first four parts going.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.230
Now let's switch it up a little bit.

06:01.250 --> 06:01.550
All right.

06:01.550 --> 06:03.120
For part e and f.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.150
Now it's going to switch the current a little bit or switch the circuit rather.

06:07.340 --> 06:12.530
So let me go ahead and just kind of make some room over here maybe remove some of these parts.

06:12.530 --> 06:16.450
The nice thing about the videos is you can always go back in to see what I did before.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.020
OK.

06:17.030 --> 06:19.040
I think this should give me enough space.

06:19.100 --> 06:22.010
So now we say that switch one is now closed.

06:22.010 --> 06:25.340
Let me go ahead and close this.

06:25.490 --> 06:25.780
All right.

06:25.780 --> 06:29.580
What is going to be the current now through this two ohm resistor.

06:29.630 --> 06:32.470
When the switch was open we said there was three amps.

06:32.690 --> 06:35.240
What happens now that it's closed.

06:35.930 --> 06:39.470
Well you can imagine over here let's kind of redraw what's going on over here.

06:39.470 --> 06:49.380
So we've got our resistor 2 ohm resistor and now there's another path.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.660
So we kind of have something like this.

06:51.700 --> 06:55.030
So what would happen now if you have two Ohmes.

06:55.440 --> 07:00.750
But now the current whatever current is going to enter over here it now has a choice.

07:01.260 --> 07:07.590
Is it going to go through the path on the kind of along this path or is it mainly going to go through

07:07.590 --> 07:13.160
the tools resistor while the two ohm resistor offers some resistance.

07:13.170 --> 07:16.060
What about this path over here on the right hand side.

07:16.110 --> 07:21.570
It offers no resistance and whenever that happens basically all the currents are going to decide to

07:21.570 --> 07:22.930
go along this path.

07:23.070 --> 07:27.920
And none of the currents going to decide to go through this two ohm resistor.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.590
Now if you want to kind of show why that is.

07:30.750 --> 07:39.020
Again if you look at the right basically we have two past that are in parallel with each other and if

07:39.020 --> 07:44.420
two paths are in parallel with each other the voltage across has to be the same regardless of the path

07:44.420 --> 07:46.070
that you take.

07:46.070 --> 07:54.290
So the voltage across these two ohm resistor is simply the value of the resistance multiplied by the

07:54.290 --> 07:56.940
current flowing through the tumor's asthore.

07:56.990 --> 07:59.170
That has to be equal to the voltage.

07:59.180 --> 08:03.570
If I go across this side the right hand side.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.530
So what's the voltage between this point over here.

08:06.530 --> 08:15.380
Call it point and point B if I'm going just along the wire against these wires are basically ideal conductors

08:15.380 --> 08:15.830
right.

08:15.830 --> 08:21.470
That's how we've simplified circuits when we've drawn them out and if they're ideal conductors they

08:21.470 --> 08:24.490
basically don't have any resistance whatsoever.

08:24.830 --> 08:30.620
So the voltage drop across something that doesn't have a resistance is zero.

08:31.550 --> 08:38.110
And the only way you can have that now is if the voltage drop across this two ohm resistor is also zero.

08:38.300 --> 08:43.680
And the only way you can have that is if you have zero because you have the resistance is two.

08:43.970 --> 08:46.850
So the current must be zero.

08:47.060 --> 08:51.530
This is basically creating a short so all the currents basically are going to go through here because

08:51.920 --> 08:57.070
it's the path of least resistance OK so that one's kind of a trick.

08:57.080 --> 09:01.930
But make sure you understand why that is are in the last part is question.

09:01.940 --> 09:08.030
AF So now we're going to open switch to switch one is going to remain closed.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.440
So let's go ahead and clean this up a little bit.

09:11.710 --> 09:16.470
So do this clean up the diagram an open switch too.

09:16.550 --> 09:16.820
OK.

09:16.820 --> 09:21.130
So this is what we have now is not the three amps anymore you got to be careful with this.

09:21.300 --> 09:21.550
OK.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.160
But we have something like that.

09:24.380 --> 09:32.390
All right so a switch is opened find the potential drop now across the six ohm resistor and across the

09:32.390 --> 09:34.350
switch.

09:34.640 --> 09:40.750
So what is the potential drop now across the 6 ohm resistor and also across the switch.

09:41.300 --> 09:49.880
Well again if this is OPEN basically the resistance here right there should not be any current flowing

09:49.880 --> 09:51.600
through that other branch.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.350
Basically all the currents going to go through the battery.

09:54.410 --> 10:00.050
It's going to go where the switch S1 was going to go down here and it has a path to go through the 12

10:00.050 --> 10:02.660
ohm resistor and then go back.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.950
So there is no more current because this is basically an infinite resistance.

10:06.950 --> 10:11.840
If I open it up if you have infinite resistance I don't care what the voltages you're going to get.

10:11.840 --> 10:12.700
Zero current.

10:12.860 --> 10:18.260
So this current here is going to be zero which means now that the potential drop across the six ohm

10:18.260 --> 10:19.090
resistor.

10:19.350 --> 10:23.410
Well the value of the resistance multiplied by the current going through it.

10:23.420 --> 10:27.610
This here has to be zero volts OK.

10:27.780 --> 10:33.290
So now the next part is what is the voltage across the switch.

10:33.450 --> 10:41.580
If you took a volt meter and you put one in here one end over here which value would I measure.

10:41.580 --> 10:44.270
So in order to find out well you kind of have to do a loop.

10:44.460 --> 10:52.140
So let's call this maybe point no which we call this let's call this maybe point C and let's call that

10:52.140 --> 10:53.800
point D.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.930
Let's find the voltage across.

10:55.950 --> 11:01.880
So that means you have to start at point D and then end up going all the way to the other point.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.770
We can't really go right across the gap.

11:03.780 --> 11:06.840
We can go somewhere else I can start over here at Point D.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.200
I can go around here.

11:08.250 --> 11:10.880
I can go around here go through the battery and end up that point.

11:10.900 --> 11:13.100
So that's what I'm going to do.

11:13.100 --> 11:19.400
So we're going to start at point D which I'm at some particular potential I go through the resistor.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.300
However we just said there is no current over here.

11:22.470 --> 11:27.510
If there's no current that I don't have to do anything with Kirchhoff's loop rule I'm going to go over

11:27.510 --> 11:28.280
here.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.190
I'm going to go over here again there's no current here.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.760
Flowing through that tumor's this is set off to do anything.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.320
Now I'm going across a battery and I'm going to go from the high potential to the lower potential.

11:39.320 --> 11:46.650
So I get a voltage drop of 18 and then I go all the way up to point C V c.

11:46.790 --> 11:53.510
So at the end the difference of potential between both of those sides is v D minus v c is going to be

11:53.510 --> 11:55.020
18 volts.

11:55.610 --> 12:01.240
So you use a volt meter you plug a volt meter in here kind of look in something like this.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.970
You're going to measure 18 volts OK.

12:05.270 --> 12:08.800
Kind of a tricky problem and I think both of these were a little bit tricky.

12:08.800 --> 12:15.140
I think the first four are more straightforward but you know make sure you understand the solution that

12:15.130 --> 12:16.910
I provided here.
