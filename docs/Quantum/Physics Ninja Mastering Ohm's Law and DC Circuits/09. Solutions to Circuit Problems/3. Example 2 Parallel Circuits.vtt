00:00.590 --> 00:03.670
Are an example to we have a parallel circuit.

00:03.670 --> 00:09.720
We have an ideal 12 volt battery applies a potential difference across this parallel combination of

00:09.720 --> 00:14.760
a four and a six ohm resistor as shown you know we have a series of questions really into this.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.790
Number one find the equivalent resistance so basically if you combine both of those.

00:20.640 --> 00:24.410
How can I combine them to form one equivalent resistance.

00:24.410 --> 00:28.650
Now I'm here you simply use the equation one over our equivalent.

00:29.310 --> 00:30.510
If there's only two.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.380
It's simply one over our one plus one over our two.

00:34.380 --> 00:38.940
That's the equivalent resistance of this network.

00:38.970 --> 00:45.170
Follow that up one over four plus one over six is one over our equivalent.

00:45.270 --> 00:50.820
Can put that on a common denominator maybe choose only 12.

00:50.820 --> 00:55.030
So this is three over 12 plus two over 12.

00:55.210 --> 00:57.320
That gives me 5 over 12.

00:58.010 --> 00:58.520
OK.

00:58.710 --> 01:01.110
So the total are equivalent now.

01:01.110 --> 01:03.080
Careful now you still have to flip that over.

01:03.090 --> 01:09.630
So it should be 12 over 5 12 over 5 ohms and get 12 over 5.

01:09.630 --> 01:13.220
Gives me 2.4.

01:13.470 --> 01:13.770
All right.

01:13.770 --> 01:17.190
So that's the equivalent resistance what's the total current now.

01:17.190 --> 01:21.330
So again you're going to have some amount of current That's again I'm not showing you the battery a

01:21.330 --> 01:26.100
lot of times they don't show you the battery or but the battery might look something like this 12 volts

01:26.220 --> 01:27.880
and you can connect it like that.

01:28.260 --> 01:33.270
So what you're going to have is you're going to have some current over here and this left most branch.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.770
That's what they're referring to the total current.

01:35.910 --> 01:40.080
After that some of their current is going to split and go through this forum resistor.

01:40.140 --> 01:45.900
Some of that current is going to continue along this and go through the six ohm resistor then recombined

01:45.900 --> 01:47.910
to give you the total current again.

01:47.910 --> 01:51.160
So what they're really asking you for is what is the total current here.

01:51.540 --> 01:57.330
But remember when we simplify this circuit using this equivalent resistance we basically have a very

01:57.330 --> 01:58.340
very simple circuit.

01:58.350 --> 02:05.720
We have a 12 volt battery and we have one equivalent resistance of 2.4 ohms.

02:05.730 --> 02:06.930
It's very easy to solve.

02:06.960 --> 02:07.240
Right.

02:07.260 --> 02:11.160
This is 2.4 this is 12 volts.

02:11.370 --> 02:14.400
The total current in this case given by ohms law.

02:14.610 --> 02:19.730
V divided by our V over r r equivalent.

02:20.160 --> 02:29.940
So at the end you get I which is 12 over 2.4 now 12 over 2.4 gives me 5 amps.

02:30.950 --> 02:31.400
OK.

02:31.570 --> 02:36.450
So that means you have 5 amps here you have five amps going through the battery you have five amps that

02:36.450 --> 02:38.770
goes all the way to this junction.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.710
That's the total current five amps.

02:41.730 --> 02:44.800
Now what's the current through each resistor.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.030
All right.

02:45.030 --> 02:53.400
The important thing now about parallel circuits is that the potential difference across every branch

02:53.400 --> 02:55.920
of the circuit must be the same.

02:56.310 --> 03:01.090
And we know what the potential differences across this branch is it's 12 volts.

03:01.440 --> 03:07.450
So that means you have to have a 12 volt potential drop across each branch of the circuit.

03:07.560 --> 03:12.410
So that means that the voltage of the battery V has to be equal to.

03:12.600 --> 03:17.910
Well if you go across this first branch across this resistor over here you have to have a voltage drop

03:17.910 --> 03:19.560
equal to the 12 volts.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.580
That's our voltage drop at 12.

03:21.630 --> 03:24.750
That must be equal to four multiplied by the current.

03:24.750 --> 03:30.300
Call it Aitu flowing then branch will be the current to maybe call this other one.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.640
I3 all right.

03:32.640 --> 03:41.050
So automatically you can write that Aitu simply 12 over 4 which gives me 3 amps.

03:41.190 --> 03:41.580
That's good.

03:41.580 --> 03:45.380
You have to have a number less than five you got five going into the junction.

03:45.390 --> 03:47.930
And now I'm going to have three that goes down here.

03:47.970 --> 03:52.230
Now we've got to find how much is going to go through the six ohm resistor again if the same thing the

03:52.230 --> 03:55.890
voltage of the battery the voltage across every branch must be the same.

03:55.940 --> 03:57.390
And that's 12.

03:57.800 --> 04:01.740
It must be six multiplied by three.

04:02.070 --> 04:11.340
In this case you automatically see that the current i3 simply 12 over 6 when you get to Imp's Hey look

04:11.340 --> 04:11.580
at that.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.390
So we get three going down here we have two going down here we have five going in.

04:15.390 --> 04:16.980
Everything works out perfectly.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.720
If you add both of those you should get five amps.

04:20.300 --> 04:21.120
OK.

04:21.210 --> 04:24.030
Next the power delivered to each resistor.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.100
So for part D.

04:25.410 --> 04:30.920
This was part C the power delivered to the four ohm resistor.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.000
Same as before.

04:32.020 --> 04:35.760
That's the value of the resistance multiplied by the current.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.080
Now which current would you choose.

04:37.080 --> 04:41.400
Now in this case you have three different values to be a little bit careful you have to choose the current

04:42.030 --> 04:45.450
flowing through that resistor we're looking at the former is this.

04:45.570 --> 04:49.950
So in this case you really have to use the three amps.

04:50.030 --> 04:56.730
Don't forget the square at the end you get nine multiplied by four you get 36 watts.

04:56.930 --> 05:01.340
That's the energy dissipated or the rate at which energy is being dissipated in this forum resistor

05:01.700 --> 05:02.810
for the 6 ohm resistor.

05:02.810 --> 05:07.030
Now power dissipated is simply 6.

05:07.190 --> 05:09.480
What is the current flowing through the 6 ohm resistor.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.870
I 3 i3 we calculate is two amps.

05:12.890 --> 05:16.750
Don't forget to square it you get four multiplied by six.

05:16.760 --> 05:18.330
Is it 24 Watts.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.820
What if you we're going to go now and add them up.

05:21.820 --> 05:24.070
What is the power supplied by the battery.

05:24.070 --> 05:28.700
Well the power supplied by the battery actually let me just do that case over here first.

05:29.410 --> 05:35.530
That's part of the power supplied by the battery by this 12 volt battery is given by the voltage of

05:35.530 --> 05:37.960
the battery multiplied by the current flowing through.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.180
In this case it's the total current.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.750
This five amps flowing through there.

05:43.270 --> 05:52.880
So that gives you 12 multiplied by five gives me 60 watts that's the total power being delivered by

05:52.880 --> 05:53.750
the battery.

05:53.990 --> 05:59.780
And notice here if you actually add the power being dissipated by both resistors what you are going

05:59.780 --> 06:02.190
to end up getting is also 60 watts.

06:02.330 --> 06:08.510
So whatever energy you're putting in per unit time is the energy being dissipated per unit time because

06:08.780 --> 06:10.830
you're not storing any energy anywhere.

06:11.890 --> 06:16.000
OK kind of a standard parallel circuit problem.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.350
Make sure you understand all the steps here and it's pretty straightforward.

06:19.360 --> 06:25.290
It's kind of easier when those only a single battery and kind of not a lot going on in this branch or

06:25.300 --> 06:29.440
you can right away right down that the voltage across each branch has to be the same and it's pretty

06:29.440 --> 06:30.600
straightforward to calculate.
