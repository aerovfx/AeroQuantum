00:00.320 --> 00:05.690
All right another sort of problem find equivalent resistance between points A and B.

00:06.010 --> 00:08.160
Let's go ahead and draw that point a

00:10.960 --> 00:13.240
simplify what's at the top.

00:13.570 --> 00:17.120
These are in series with each other we have a 12 and a 6.

00:17.380 --> 00:23.260
I'm just going to write it like this at the end 18 at the top is point B.

00:23.260 --> 00:23.490
All right.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.040
How can I simplify the bottom here.

00:25.060 --> 00:30.430
Well we're going to have this let's just leave the six here the way it is.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.980
How can I simplify both of these sixes.

00:32.980 --> 00:35.780
Now these are parallel to each other.

00:35.830 --> 00:40.300
What do you do if you multiply them 36 divided by 12.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.740
Multiply them divided by the sum.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.250
That gives me three.

00:44.890 --> 00:46.640
So you get three.

00:46.720 --> 00:47.980
So at the end what do we get.

00:47.980 --> 00:50.700
Both of these can be combined here.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.160
This or simply in series with each other.

00:53.170 --> 00:54.760
So that's a 9.

00:54.940 --> 01:02.700
And at the end all we have to do is we get an 18 ohm resistor that is in parallel with a 9 ohm resistor.

01:03.070 --> 01:11.960
So the last part total is 18 multiplied by nine divided by the sum of nine plus 18.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.930
Am not going to try to do that in my head but there's Neyens and Eatons everywhere.

01:16.210 --> 01:20.520
If I factor out a 9 from the bottom I should have one plus two.

01:20.550 --> 01:27.430
Now this should simplify nicely that 9 could cancel with this one 18 can cancel with the three here

01:27.490 --> 01:36.220
and I'll be left with six at the end you should be left with six ohms so all of this is equivalent to

01:36.220 --> 01:37.660
1 6 ohm resistor.

01:37.660 --> 01:38.990
That's it.

01:39.850 --> 01:40.200
All right.

01:40.210 --> 01:41.870
So if the potential drop now.

01:41.910 --> 01:44.430
So this is kind of connected here to a battery.

01:44.470 --> 01:48.520
You can imagine something like this 12 volt battery

01:51.590 --> 01:54.360
find the current in each resistor.

01:54.380 --> 01:54.800
All right.

01:54.980 --> 01:58.420
So what I'm going to first do here is we're going to simplify this a little bit.

01:58.420 --> 02:00.620
I'm going to kind of do this problem over here.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.710
I can replace everything down here by nine.

02:03.710 --> 02:05.440
We just said.

02:05.610 --> 02:12.000
So let's start by finding the Curran's over here and we can also find the current flowing into the junction.

02:12.050 --> 02:12.620
Right.

02:12.770 --> 02:14.900
Because we know that total is like a 6.

02:14.900 --> 02:15.470
Right.

02:15.470 --> 02:21.650
So let's find out how much current is actually flowing into the junction and for that I'm just basically

02:21.650 --> 02:25.140
replacing it by the total equivalent resistance.

02:25.580 --> 02:31.880
So that means that the total current flowing in simply going to be my 12 volts divided by six I'm going

02:31.880 --> 02:34.390
to get two amps flowing in.

02:34.460 --> 02:37.810
So this guy over here is two Imp's.

02:37.850 --> 02:40.390
That's the current flowing in.

02:40.490 --> 02:45.260
Now part of that current is going to go up here and that's going to be the same current that's going

02:45.260 --> 02:47.630
to flow through the 12 and the 6.

02:47.630 --> 02:49.390
So let me call this one.

02:49.930 --> 02:53.380
And part of the current now is also going to flow down here.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.080
Let's call this itu.

02:56.300 --> 03:02.930
Now you should realize right away that the voltage across both of these branches have to be the same

03:03.710 --> 03:08.660
and the only way you can have that is if the current flowing through down here has to be bigger than

03:08.660 --> 03:12.880
the current flowing through here because the resistance is bigger.

03:12.920 --> 03:15.230
So how do you get the same voltage across each one.

03:15.230 --> 03:23.060
Well you should automatically be able to write that 18 multiplied by the current flowing through there

03:23.060 --> 03:28.310
that's the voltage drop across the top that has to be equal to the voltage drop across the bottom So

03:28.310 --> 03:31.180
that's nine multiplied by two.

03:31.970 --> 03:34.640
Now the other thing we know is that there's two waves going in.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.100
So you have to have two which equals to either one plus two.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.510
That's our junction rule.

03:41.960 --> 03:49.070
These are the two equations we can use now to find how much current is going up here and downstairs.

03:49.160 --> 03:57.830
So you should write that to simply going to be two times I won now use our junction equation to eliminate

03:57.890 --> 03:58.970
Aitu.

03:59.480 --> 04:09.680
So here I'm going to get two equals to one plus two I want gigas three I want.

04:10.210 --> 04:10.460
All right.

04:10.460 --> 04:20.670
Therefore the current one is two thirds amps and the current two is two times that value.

04:20.750 --> 04:25.390
So we just found there has to be four thirds.

04:27.050 --> 04:34.110
All right so now we know the current dallies through both of those at the top because that's the same.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.410
Now the current to that we just solved.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.100
Well sure it's going to be split.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.680
Let's go back to our diagram.

04:39.680 --> 04:45.180
So part of that current part of this you know 1.3 or three is going to be split it's going to go up

04:45.180 --> 04:45.920
stairs.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.080
Part of it is going to go down here.

04:48.500 --> 04:55.430
However since both of those are the same and we know we've seen this before whenever the resistor is

04:55.430 --> 05:01.970
the same and they're in parallel and if there's only two branches whatever goes in has to split evenly.

05:02.330 --> 05:08.390
If it doesn't split evenly you're not going to get the same voltage drop across each branch.

05:08.390 --> 05:08.710
Right.

05:08.720 --> 05:13.840
So we can automatically find how much current flows through these six ohm resistors.

05:14.440 --> 05:14.770
OK.

05:14.780 --> 05:20.900
So for that I'm just going to call this three three is the current flowing over here and if the same

05:20.900 --> 05:30.240
current flowing down here so three automatically has to be Aitu divided by two.

05:32.490 --> 05:38.500
Two over two which gives me what I again that's two thirds.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.080
That's pretty easy.

05:40.550 --> 05:45.400
And now how much current is flowing through this 6 ohm resistor over here.

05:46.130 --> 05:52.520
Again now when we already found this here has to be the current I do because both of those i3 is going

05:52.520 --> 05:55.610
to combine again there's another junction right here.

05:55.940 --> 06:01.160
We have another junction down at this point and whatever flows into the junction has to be with flowing

06:01.220 --> 06:02.690
out of the junction.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.690
So this is also the current Aitu.

06:04.940 --> 06:11.630
So he's basically SOL for all of currents now flowing through each resistor using pretty simple arguments.
