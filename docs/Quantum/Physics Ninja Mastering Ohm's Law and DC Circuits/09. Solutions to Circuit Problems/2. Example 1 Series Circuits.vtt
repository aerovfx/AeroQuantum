00:00.270 --> 00:04.830
All right here's a problem one from a series package.

00:04.830 --> 00:07.470
We have two resistors here are connected in series.

00:07.470 --> 00:09.200
You see it as a four almost six ohm.

00:09.300 --> 00:12.820
They're connected in series to a 12 volt volt battery.

00:13.140 --> 00:18.630
And what they're asking for now a whole bunch of questions related to this problem is battery here is

00:18.630 --> 00:22.330
an ideal battery so there is no internal resistance.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.570
And the first thing I ask you is to find the equivalent resistance of the two resistors.

00:27.570 --> 00:34.490
Well again if both of these are in series over here that means that the equivalent resistor are equivalent

00:34.850 --> 00:37.970
is you simply add them up.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.570
They have the same current flowing through them.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.000
So let's just call this one let's call these are two.

00:45.310 --> 00:49.760
So at the end you simply have four plus six you should simply get 10 ohms.

00:50.140 --> 00:51.400
Pretty straightforward.

00:51.790 --> 00:57.550
Now once you have done this basically what we've done now is we've replaced both of those by a single

00:57.550 --> 00:59.000
10 ohm resistor.

01:00.290 --> 01:05.510
So we still have the same 12 volt battery except now we have our equivalent resistor which is equal

01:05.510 --> 01:13.220
to 10 ohms so applying ohms law to this very simple circuit is really straightforward and that allows

01:13.220 --> 01:16.610
you right away to find what the current in the circuit is.

01:16.610 --> 01:22.940
So if you apply Ohm's law of the circuit you have v equals the R I accept Rs are equivalent in this

01:22.940 --> 01:28.580
case and I is the current everywhere in this branch a single branch.

01:28.850 --> 01:33.540
So the current I now simply going to be equal to V divided by my are equivalent.

01:35.370 --> 01:39.400
V is 12 divided by 10.

01:39.510 --> 01:44.990
So you get 6 over 5 which is equal to 1.2 amps.

01:45.690 --> 01:47.350
So there is problem b.

01:47.880 --> 01:48.090
All right.

01:48.090 --> 01:53.120
Problem see now we're asking you what is the voltage now across each resistor.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.550
So Imagineer I have a point.

01:54.570 --> 01:57.860
A I have a point B and I have a point.

01:57.860 --> 02:02.380
See what they're asking for basically is what is V.A mine is VB.

02:02.390 --> 02:07.500
That will be the voltage across the four ohm resistor and then they're asking what is VB minus mine

02:07.520 --> 02:08.140
VC.

02:08.150 --> 02:10.030
That's the voltage difference.

02:10.170 --> 02:13.100
The potential difference across the six ohm resistor.

02:13.620 --> 02:16.520
So for the first one let's start at point A.

02:16.710 --> 02:21.750
So if you start at point A You're going to be at some potential let's call it vitÃ¦.

02:22.020 --> 02:24.680
And now I'm going to go all the way to point B.

02:24.870 --> 02:27.790
The first thing I'd do is I'm crossing a forum.

02:27.810 --> 02:31.020
They're in the same direction as the current.

02:31.170 --> 02:36.690
If you do that you get a voltage drop and the voltage drop is given by Ohm's law is given by the value

02:36.690 --> 02:41.160
of the resistance multiplied by the current flowing through it.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.320
And now you end up going all the way to point B so that there must be equal to the potential at point

02:46.320 --> 02:47.280
B.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.650
This is not like doing a complete loop.

02:49.650 --> 02:54.420
I'm not doing a complete loop I'm starting at point a terminating at point B.

02:54.420 --> 02:57.590
So in this case here we get V.A.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.770
Mine is VB.

02:58.920 --> 03:04.010
That's basically what I'm looking for that is the voltage difference across my form resists.

03:04.020 --> 03:07.170
There is simply four times the current.

03:07.390 --> 03:10.580
In this case it's four times 1.2.

03:11.170 --> 03:16.480
And that gives me a voltage difference of 4.8 volts.

03:16.590 --> 03:16.900
All right.

03:16.900 --> 03:21.880
How about the next one while we proceed using the same arguments you start now at point B so I'm at

03:21.880 --> 03:23.960
a potential VB.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.220
Now I'm going across a 6 ohm resistor.

03:26.260 --> 03:29.020
It's the same thing minus six multiplied.

03:29.200 --> 03:35.530
I said six and I wrote for a try that again six multiplied by the current.

03:35.600 --> 03:42.400
I then that there has to be equal to the voltage at Point C again and rearranging this expression over

03:42.400 --> 03:42.620
here.

03:42.640 --> 03:50.620
What you end up getting is the B minus VC is simply six times the current AI.

03:51.130 --> 03:59.270
So six times a 1.2 is the current at the end you should get 7.2 volts one thing we should notice also

03:59.270 --> 04:08.210
in addition is if you add both of those 4.8 plus 7.2 So you add them all you end up getting my 12 volts

04:09.020 --> 04:14.120
because it doesn't matter if I started over here a point and I went all the way to point see if I went

04:14.120 --> 04:17.060
across both resistors I should get 12 volts.

04:17.060 --> 04:23.480
If I go this way through the battery and go to point C I should also get 12 volts.

04:23.630 --> 04:23.900
All right.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.570
So that takes care of this one.

04:25.980 --> 04:31.190
I've got the other two taking care of what is now the power delivered to each resistor or in other words

04:31.220 --> 04:35.060
what is the power dissipated in each resistor.

04:35.060 --> 04:38.630
So in order to get the power dissipated let me just split the SEPA a little bit.

04:39.910 --> 04:46.690
OK so for Pardhi the power delivered to each resistor Well we've got the power delivered to the four

04:46.690 --> 04:48.160
ohm resistor.

04:48.250 --> 04:53.720
This is simply the value of the resistance multiplied by the current flowing through it squared.

04:55.030 --> 05:00.560
So in this case here the resistance is forums and the current is the same everywhere it's 1.2.

05:00.560 --> 05:09.630
And don't forget the square that so the power our final expression now the power delivered to the four

05:09.640 --> 05:14.430
ohm resistor ends up being five point seventy six watts.

05:16.620 --> 05:21.350
Same thing for the six same formula except we have a different value of the resistance.

05:21.480 --> 05:28.050
The power dissipated or the power delivered to the six ohm resistor there is six multiplied by the current

05:28.050 --> 05:28.910
flowing through it.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.920
That's one point too.

05:30.930 --> 05:36.450
Don't forget the square of that and the total power dissipated in this resistor here ends up being eight

05:36.450 --> 05:39.800
point six for Watts.

05:39.950 --> 05:46.680
Actually if you add those up you're going to get the total power that's dissipated the total power dissipated.

05:46.700 --> 05:52.030
So five point six plus 8.6 for you add both of those up.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.650
You get fourteen point four watts.

05:55.190 --> 05:59.350
That is the total power dissipated by both of those resistors.

05:59.530 --> 06:03.730
Actually you can check that if you look at it now the power being supplied by the battery

06:06.520 --> 06:10.990
that's simply given by the voltage of the battery multiplied by the current flowing through it.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.550
We get 12.

06:13.650 --> 06:16.060
The currents the same everywhere in this circuit.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.240
That's 1.2.

06:18.260 --> 06:23.840
You multiply those out you're going to get a little behold fourteen point four watts.

06:24.080 --> 06:31.750
So the power being delivered to the circuit by the battery is being dissipated in these resistors.

06:31.770 --> 06:32.130
All right.

06:32.140 --> 06:35.520
Hope you've got that one folks kind of a good warm up problem.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.560
See the next one.
