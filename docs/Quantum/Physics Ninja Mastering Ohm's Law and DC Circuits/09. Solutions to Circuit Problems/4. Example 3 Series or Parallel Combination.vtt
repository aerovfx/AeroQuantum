00:00.520 --> 00:07.680
All right example three Here is a short kind of conceptual problem involves combination of resistors

00:07.680 --> 00:09.370
in series and in parallel.

00:09.540 --> 00:15.960
And we have two questions it says given the circuit over here with many resistors we have six one single

00:15.960 --> 00:17.390
battery over here.

00:17.400 --> 00:23.780
First question is which resistor is if any are connected in series.

00:23.820 --> 00:26.990
How can we find which ones are connected in series.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.620
Well remember if something is in series I mean you had like kind of simple examples right if we had

00:31.620 --> 00:35.190
something like this and something like this.

00:35.190 --> 00:38.680
I mean those ones are clearly in series with each other.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.720
Now clearly this example doesn't have any of these super easy cases.

00:43.260 --> 00:48.900
However one thing that's common about something that is in series imagine here if I introduce two points

00:50.190 --> 00:58.820
A and B if they are in series it means that the current flowing through them necessarily has to be the

00:58.820 --> 01:01.640
same because the electrons have nowhere else to go.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.270
There is only a single path.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.920
In other words there is only a single branch if they are in series with one another.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.520
So let's have a look at all the branches.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.090
So how many branches do we have.

01:13.090 --> 01:13.970
Number one.

01:13.970 --> 01:15.650
Let's go ahead maybe highlight some of those.

01:15.650 --> 01:16.650
See if I can do this.

01:16.660 --> 01:19.070
So here the branch there is won.

01:19.280 --> 01:19.970
What else.

01:20.030 --> 01:22.070
Here's another branch down here.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.100
Maybe a third or another one over here.

01:25.130 --> 01:27.730
Go down here all the way to the point C.

01:27.750 --> 01:30.780
And then what else is another branch over here.

01:31.340 --> 01:35.850
And I don't know one more down here through the diagonal.

01:35.900 --> 01:39.020
So these are all the branches to this circuit.

01:39.110 --> 01:42.450
We have one two three four five.

01:42.500 --> 01:48.230
We have five different branches to the circuit and now we have to identify are there resistors on the

01:48.230 --> 01:49.670
same branch.

01:50.030 --> 01:55.940
If you start with the orange highlighted one now although there is a battery in between them that really

01:55.940 --> 02:01.520
doesn't matter because even in the simple case if I had a battery kind of located right at the midpoint

02:01.520 --> 02:06.890
here between both of them these two would still be in series because the current flowing through them

02:06.890 --> 02:08.830
would have to be the same.

02:08.990 --> 02:17.360
So the resistors that are in series we have to have that are 1 and are six are in series with one another

02:20.400 --> 02:21.990
anything else.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.210
Now you might be tempted to try to combine some of these other ones however.

02:25.380 --> 02:27.890
They're all on different branches right.

02:27.910 --> 02:31.490
And there is no guarantee that the current flowing through them is going to be the same.

02:31.830 --> 02:32.630
OK.

02:33.090 --> 02:36.990
So these ones are definitely certainly not in series with each other.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.010
So this is really the only pair of resistors that are in series with each other.

02:42.060 --> 02:49.120
So here I'd be able to combine our one in our six by 1 equivalent resistor simply equal to the sum.

02:49.170 --> 02:49.660
All right.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.510
How about KSB which ones are connected in parallel to each other.

02:54.740 --> 03:01.140
Now for the parallel case or really what I would really suggest with some of these circuits and sometimes

03:01.140 --> 03:06.150
they try to do something like this on the right hand side is they try to make it more complicated than

03:06.150 --> 03:06.820
it is.

03:06.990 --> 03:11.310
So let me kind of clean this up a little bit here okay.

03:11.490 --> 03:14.220
Yeah they sometimes they draw some resistors and diagonal.

03:14.220 --> 03:19.350
One thing you have to remember is that these wires here at least in these ideal circuits they dont have

03:19.350 --> 03:24.840
any resistance which means you can make them longer or you can make them shorter or you can deform this

03:24.840 --> 03:29.970
as long as you don't change kind of the topology of the circuit you're going to get the same answer.

03:29.970 --> 03:31.620
So let me show you what I mean by that.

03:31.620 --> 03:35.880
So imagine if I redraw the circuit kind of quickly here just do it in black.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.830
But here's our one.

03:37.950 --> 03:39.390
Let's keep that in the same.

03:39.390 --> 03:44.070
Let's draw a more kind of in Cartesian form get rid of that diagonal I think is what I really want to

03:44.070 --> 03:47.470
get to let's draw our six down here.

03:47.850 --> 03:48.230
OK.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.370
So here we have our two here we have our six.

03:52.980 --> 03:53.340
All right.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.870
Now this is point D down here.

03:54.860 --> 03:58.940
Now if I extend point the I'm going to keep our 5 or 8 where it is.

03:59.020 --> 04:01.330
That's this one over here are five.

04:01.870 --> 04:06.460
Now instead of kind of launching these three kind of from the same point really what I'm going to do

04:06.460 --> 04:08.090
is I can extend this.

04:08.410 --> 04:14.470
I can extend this a little bit this way and I know that are four can kind of connect after our 5 over

04:14.470 --> 04:15.840
here here's pt. s..

04:16.210 --> 04:16.880
And it goes.

04:16.880 --> 04:22.330
Now although point B is here I can make this wire longer and it really doesn't change anything here.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.760
And I can put our For like this.

04:26.810 --> 04:29.950
This is our 4 and now I'm left with.

04:30.050 --> 04:32.060
So you can call this kind of point B prime.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.750
I haven't really changed anything.

04:34.310 --> 04:40.400
And the last thing now would be the resistance are three are three K'NEX point B to point C log in to

04:40.400 --> 04:41.610
connect point B to points.

04:41.600 --> 04:42.530
You can do this

04:45.620 --> 04:48.970
this would be the resistance are three.

04:49.280 --> 04:54.600
Now you see if you have it in this form it's much easier actually to determine which resistors are in

04:54.600 --> 04:56.320
and parallel with each other.

04:56.920 --> 05:00.240
Now right away you think you should be able to say that.

05:00.290 --> 05:06.370
Well let's look at these clearly are four and are three are in parallel with each other.

05:06.650 --> 05:07.940
So we can write that down.

05:09.220 --> 05:11.890
There is one pair that are in parallel.

05:11.900 --> 05:19.870
So we have our three and R for the voltage across both of these have to be the same.

05:20.090 --> 05:24.650
Now what about R2 I guess the other problem is what do we do with our two halves are two in parallel

05:24.650 --> 05:26.180
with our three.

05:26.180 --> 05:32.040
Now the only complication with this one is we have that this resistor our 5 comes into play here.

05:32.120 --> 05:39.110
So that means that the voltage across our four and our three is not going to be the same necessarily

05:39.110 --> 05:44.480
as the voltage across our two because we have this other resistor over here.

05:44.480 --> 05:46.710
So that kind of ruins it for us.

05:46.730 --> 05:54.890
So the only combination we have are are three and are four are in parallel and that's it.

05:54.890 --> 06:00.740
Now this entire network can be simplified now we can combine our three and our 4 and 2 1 equivalent

06:01.260 --> 06:03.040
resist there.

06:03.200 --> 06:08.150
Then I can combine that equivalent resistor with our Because the equivalent resistor of our three and

06:08.360 --> 06:14.750
four are going to be in series with R5 and then you can proceed kind of all the way until the end.

06:16.390 --> 06:18.440
OK but that's it for these two.

06:18.580 --> 06:20.020
So you got that one right.

06:20.140 --> 06:25.000
These kinds of questions can sometimes be a little bit more conceptually difficult but keep in mind

06:25.000 --> 06:30.220
you can deform you can make these wires as long as possible as long as you're still kind of you haven't

06:30.220 --> 06:32.270
really changed anything about the circuit.

06:32.420 --> 06:33.670
OK and I haven't really.

06:33.670 --> 06:39.870
This is really is the same circuit as this one I've just deform the wires which is OK to do.
