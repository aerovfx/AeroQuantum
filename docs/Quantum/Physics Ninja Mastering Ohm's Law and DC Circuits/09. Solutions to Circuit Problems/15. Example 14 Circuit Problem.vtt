00:00.340 --> 00:06.360
Are 14 again similar to the other one if you more resistors looks a little bit harder find the equivalent

00:06.360 --> 00:13.180
resistance between points A and B do the exact same thing as what I previously did at the bottom here

00:13.180 --> 00:17.210
is pretty simple this is for what else.

00:17.210 --> 00:25.270
9 8 9 8 if you combine both of those you multiply them divided by the sum you'll also get four.

00:25.380 --> 00:26.390
So that one's easy.

00:26.390 --> 00:29.520
It's a bottom branch of the top branch.

00:29.520 --> 00:32.200
I'm going to leave this 6 over here for now.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.690
Now let's simplify all of these two.

00:33.690 --> 00:40.160
So first of all this two and the four can be combined in series with each other so that 6 ohms.

00:40.490 --> 00:43.160
And then you have a four and a six.

00:43.170 --> 00:46.930
How do you combine both of those four and six.

00:47.040 --> 00:52.190
Again remember what you have here you know for here you're going to have six.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.900
How can I simplify both of those on both of those you can multiply them divided by the sum you multiply

00:57.900 --> 01:02.420
them you get 24 divided by 10 that gives me 2.4.

01:03.240 --> 01:03.470
All right.

01:03.480 --> 01:14.110
So this whole thing this whole bit over here could be simplified into a 2.4 ohm equivalent resistor.

01:14.220 --> 01:17.370
So you go back to my diagram over here.

01:17.700 --> 01:22.180
So I have 2.4 something like this.

01:22.230 --> 01:22.740
OK.

01:22.890 --> 01:25.790
Now it's still on done but we're getting there.

01:26.070 --> 01:31.690
So the bottom over here again these I can group together that's very easy.

01:31.860 --> 01:37.680
That's an 8 ohm equivalent resistor and up here I have a six and a 2.4.

01:37.980 --> 01:41.610
Well that's an eight point four ohm equivalent resistor.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.200
So at the end we're left with an eight point four and an eight.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.430
And those are in parallel with each other.

01:47.850 --> 01:57.590
So the equivalent resistor of the entire thing I can multiply those and divide by the sum

02:01.040 --> 02:04.450
at the end thing I got 4.1.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.690
So that was pretty straightforward.

02:07.690 --> 02:08.020
All right.

02:08.020 --> 02:11.820
Now gets a little bit complicated because the numbers are not very kind.

02:11.830 --> 02:15.720
So for this we're going to have to do it just numerically using the calculator.

02:15.820 --> 02:16.370
OK.

02:16.660 --> 02:22.380
So let's first find how much current is actually flowing into this first junction over here.

02:22.430 --> 02:22.850
Right.

02:23.230 --> 02:29.010
Because we've simplified this entire network so we can find how much current is out here in these branches.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.690
Let's do that.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.640
So again the current simply going to be the voltage which is 12 divided by point 4.1.

02:38.980 --> 02:43.090
So that gave me 2.9 three.

02:43.630 --> 02:48.720
So that was the current I flowing into the junction.

02:48.760 --> 02:49.050
All right.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.760
So is the junction.

02:50.800 --> 02:57.550
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to call the current one flowing upstairs and the current two flowing

02:57.550 --> 03:00.400
downstairs like this.

03:00.490 --> 03:06.110
So we have to have that 2.9 three must be equal to one plus two.

03:06.190 --> 03:09.950
That's the junction rule.

03:10.140 --> 03:11.950
We can call this equation 1.

03:12.010 --> 03:16.390
Now the other thing we can do now is we can also write down either a loop rule or you can automatically

03:16.390 --> 03:21.340
write it down that the voltage across the top branch has to be equal to the voltage across the bottom

03:21.340 --> 03:31.420
range the voltage across the top branch is eight point four multiplied by one must be equal to the voltage

03:31.420 --> 03:34.970
across the bottom branch because they are in parallel with each other.

03:35.020 --> 03:40.490
So this is eight multiplied by two.

03:40.840 --> 03:46.240
So while it's kind of simplify that using an equation one now equation one let's just call it equation

03:46.240 --> 03:49.150
one prime becomes this 2.9 3.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.650
That must be equal to.

03:53.860 --> 03:54.080
Right.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.750
This is one.

03:56.040 --> 04:04.040
Now eliminate eye to high to simply be eight point four divided by eight multiplied by 1.

04:04.060 --> 04:09.760
So at the end the value of Iowa and you get from this equation over here after substituting everything

04:09.760 --> 04:15.430
in I think I got one point for three.

04:16.570 --> 04:17.160
OK.

04:17.320 --> 04:21.980
Now I go back to my Dzogchen rule equation 1 I know I was 1.4 3.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.710
This here was 2.9 3.

04:25.060 --> 04:30.860
Well you can automatically find what the current too is right.

04:30.910 --> 04:36.130
Aitu should be approximately 1.5.

04:36.520 --> 04:39.280
Now all of these are going to be within kind of one one hundredth three.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.450
There might be some rounding error.

04:40.450 --> 04:42.080
So be a little bit careful.

04:42.640 --> 04:42.880
All right.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.950
The next thing that's kind of easy is.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.650
Well let's look at the bottom branch.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.300
This is the bottom branch I found I just found that I too was going down here.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.860
That means that the current through this guy has to be Aitu.

04:56.610 --> 05:00.020
Now I two approaches this junction over here.

05:00.460 --> 05:04.350
Now look what happens there's an 8 ohm resistance up here so it's going to be split.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.460
Part of that curve is going to go up here.

05:06.580 --> 05:09.830
Part of it's going to be going over in that direction.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.510
Let's call this current i3.

05:12.760 --> 05:21.790
This one must also be equal to i3 because the resistances are both 8 ohms and that's the only way that

05:21.790 --> 05:24.450
the voltage is going to be the same.

05:25.660 --> 05:32.290
So does that automatically tell us tells us that that current three must be exactly half so must be

05:32.440 --> 05:37.850
0.75 because you have 1.5 coming in.

05:37.930 --> 05:39.600
Point 7 5 is going to go up.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.380
Point seven five is going to go down.

05:41.650 --> 05:41.860
OK.

05:41.860 --> 05:45.150
So we've solved everything over here.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.860
Let's go back to the top.

05:47.140 --> 05:52.350
So we had obtain i 1 is going here that means I won is flowing through that 6 ohm resistor.

05:52.900 --> 05:53.980
And now what happens.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.830
Well now it's me kind of draw on this one.

05:57.220 --> 06:00.290
So you have I won going into that junction.

06:00.730 --> 06:05.380
Now some of the currents going to go up here and some of the current is going to go through the six

06:05.380 --> 06:09.960
ohm resistor or the two and the four if you want.

06:10.360 --> 06:18.760
So let me call this I-5 Let's call this one here I 6 so we can write a junction rule here that says

06:18.760 --> 06:28.680
that I one must be equal to I five plus six.

06:28.850 --> 06:34.130
So we have an equation here for high five and six but we only have one.

06:34.130 --> 06:36.390
So we need at least one other equation.

06:37.080 --> 06:43.910
But the only thing you have to remember is that the voltage drop across across the forum resists there

06:44.240 --> 06:50.120
must be equal to the voltage drop across the six ohm resistor because they are in parallel with each

06:50.120 --> 06:51.100
other.

06:51.830 --> 06:57.800
So again it's kind of similar to what we did before so the voltage drop across the forum resistor is

06:57.800 --> 07:05.510
four times five and the voltage drop across the six ohm or which is an equivalent one but it's six times

07:05.690 --> 07:07.890
six.

07:08.320 --> 07:14.950
So that automatically means that I-5 has to be 1.5 times six.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.300
You can go ahead and substitute that in here.

07:17.480 --> 07:23.120
And then you're going to get one equation for I-5.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.960
So at the end what you end up getting you could solve this.

07:26.960 --> 07:33.830
You get one point for three has to be equal to five plus

07:36.730 --> 07:38.940
know soil's do it the other way around.

07:39.380 --> 07:40.740
I just realized what I did here.

07:40.940 --> 07:49.910
I said I five was 1.5 times six so this is 1.5 6 Plus I 6.

07:49.980 --> 07:52.600
Solve this for six.

07:52.870 --> 07:57.660
I will give you approximately 0.5 7 amps.

07:58.250 --> 08:03.770
Once you get I 6 is 5.7 5 7 amps.

08:03.800 --> 08:10.220
We can then go back and automatically solve for what 5 is because you know its 1.5 times six.

08:10.370 --> 08:15.970
This guy here gives you a 0.6.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.760
All right so let's go back to the diagram.

08:17.820 --> 08:19.080
That means so we had.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.170
Remember let's go back to this original figure.

08:21.390 --> 08:24.660
So I won the current I won.

08:24.750 --> 08:29.100
Where was it 1.4 3.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.980
Think about it you're going to have more current flowing through the top.

08:33.360 --> 08:38.930
So I-5 is at zero point eighty six.

08:38.940 --> 08:43.310
You have less current flowing through this bottom branch because there's more resistance.

08:43.310 --> 08:51.320
The current flowing through that bottom branch here is 0.5 7 amps and kind of boxed this up here so

08:51.330 --> 08:54.920
you can find the solution quickly.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.040
But it's always using the same kind of steps.

08:58.040 --> 08:58.630
OK.

08:58.740 --> 09:01.520
Hopefully you kind of start seeing that now.

09:02.220 --> 09:08.070
It's kind of simplified in terms of equivalent resistances at the beginning and applied junction rules

09:08.070 --> 09:14.400
and then you end up getting all these kind of these parallel branches in most of these cases.

09:14.760 --> 09:19.760
And for that you also have to write down that the voltage across each branch has to be the same.

09:19.830 --> 09:22.970
So you end up ex-British having expressions like this one.

09:23.130 --> 09:26.950
You end up having an expression like this one over here.

09:27.570 --> 09:32.200
And then you can use that in our junction rules in order to simplify and solve for the unknowns.
