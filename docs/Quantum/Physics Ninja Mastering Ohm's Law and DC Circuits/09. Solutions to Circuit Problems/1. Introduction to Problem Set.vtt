Hi everyone and welcome to the problem set on DC circuits but only relating to resist theories and batteries.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.480
So I've put together 16 different problems here ranging in difficulty I think the easier ones are at

00:12.480 --> 00:15.780
the beginning and the harder ones kind of fall toward the end.

00:16.050 --> 00:20.010
But there's really a mix of different problems where you're going to end up practicing Kirchhoff's rules

00:20.200 --> 00:25.800
are going to calculate the currents in single branch and multi loop circuits you know calculate power

00:25.830 --> 00:30.790
dissipated and power delivered to the circuit from the power supplies.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.010
So good luck with the problems.

00:32.010 --> 00:34.520
I really suggest you kind of do one problem at a time.

00:34.530 --> 00:35.610
Try it on your own.

00:35.700 --> 00:39.210
Come watch the solution at the beginning it's not a big concern if you don't quite understand all the

00:39.210 --> 00:39.830
steps.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.350
I think after you start watching some of the solutions you're going to build on that and then you'll

00:43.350 --> 00:45.520
be able to apply it to harder problems.

00:45.750 --> 00:46.850
So good luck everybody.

00:46.920 --> 00:50.730
Again if you ever have any questions just shoot me an email I'll get back to you.

00:50.760 --> 00:51.360
Happy learning.
