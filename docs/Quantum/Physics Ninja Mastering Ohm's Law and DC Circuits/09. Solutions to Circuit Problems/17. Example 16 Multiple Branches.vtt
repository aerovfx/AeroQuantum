00:00.150 --> 00:05.850
Or here's the last problem from the problems that got the three batteries for resistors.

00:06.020 --> 00:07.020
A few questions here.

00:07.020 --> 00:09.390
First one find the current in each resistor.

00:09.390 --> 00:09.630
All right.

00:09.630 --> 00:12.000
So what I'm going to do is to label the current over here.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.040
Let's call this the current.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.670
I don't know what's going to happen here.

00:15.690 --> 00:21.690
Let's assume that the current here is going like in this direction going up near the junction and then

00:21.690 --> 00:22.350
maybe the current.

00:22.350 --> 00:27.570
I don't know maybe I'm going to go down here call this the current Aitu.

00:27.660 --> 00:32.850
Next thing I can do right down the junction rule for the junction over here it says whatever is flowing

00:32.850 --> 00:37.770
into the junction has to be what's going out now be a little careful here there's two currents flowing

00:37.770 --> 00:40.030
in the way I have it labeled.

00:40.130 --> 00:40.560
All right.

00:40.580 --> 00:45.570
There's I plus the current I want in this first branch and then that must be equal to the current flowing

00:45.570 --> 00:47.170
out Aitu.

00:47.820 --> 00:52.710
All right that's going to be my equation 1 3 unknown's I need at least two more equations so let's go

00:52.710 --> 00:57.730
ahead and write some loop rules for the loop rules make them start down over here at this point.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.070
Let's do the outer loop.

01:00.330 --> 01:02.760
All right if I do the outer loop what am I going to get.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.660
Well first thing I get is Plus 8.

01:05.830 --> 01:07.170
Call this equation 2.

01:07.510 --> 01:14.040
I cross a battery in the direction of the current then I get a voltage drop equal to 1 multiplied by

01:14.040 --> 01:15.370
the current.

01:16.100 --> 01:22.830
Then I get a voltage gain because I'm crossing that battery plus four and I get another voltage drop

01:22.980 --> 01:24.820
two times the current.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.790
And then after I switch I go to the outer branch and I'm going to get another voltage drop given by

01:29.790 --> 01:32.300
six times the current flowing through it.

01:32.310 --> 01:36.990
Aitu is equal to zero.

01:37.190 --> 01:38.400
That's equation too.

01:38.660 --> 01:44.390
Let's maybe simplify this if I can combine the eight and the for what else.

01:44.390 --> 01:45.980
Combine both of those.

01:46.040 --> 01:50.020
Both of these are multiplied by I can combine both of those.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.840
So equation 2 can look like this.

01:51.840 --> 01:58.320
It's 12 minus three times I and minus six times I.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.920
That equals zero.

02:00.110 --> 02:02.710
So this will really be the equation too that I'm going to use.

02:03.050 --> 02:04.280
And we need at least one more.

02:04.280 --> 02:08.100
Now when I'm going to do a mini choose this inner loop over here.

02:08.780 --> 02:12.980
All right again the first four terms are going to look exactly the same right.

02:12.980 --> 02:18.830
So you're gonna have eight minus a voltage drop across the one ohm resistor Plus the voltage gain of

02:18.830 --> 02:24.290
that other battery minus the voltage drop across that 2 ohm resistor.

02:24.290 --> 02:27.910
Again I could have combined both of those resistors because they're in series with each other.

02:28.430 --> 02:29.330
But that's OK for now.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.880
Now I'm going to go down this middle branch here.

02:31.970 --> 02:36.970
Now you got to be careful now I'm going across a resistor in the opposite direction of the current.

02:37.280 --> 02:41.880
So there is a voltage gain equal to two times the current one.

02:42.500 --> 02:47.690
And then again I'm going to cross a battery now I'm going from the high potential to the lower potential.

02:47.690 --> 02:55.150
So there is a voltage drop given by four volts and I go back to where I start and that's equal to zero.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.440
Now let's simplify some things I have plus for here I have minus four here.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.270
Again you can combine both of those again.

03:03.020 --> 03:13.790
So this equation 3 will simplify to eight minus three times I plus two times one equals zero.

03:13.850 --> 03:16.020
So that's equation 3.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.510
So now what I'm going to do I'm going to do the same steps I did previously.

03:19.790 --> 03:26.980
What I'm going to do is I'm going to isolate the current Aitu from equation 2 and I'm going to isolate

03:26.980 --> 03:29.730
the current one from equation 3.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.480
If you do that here you're going to get that Aitu.

03:33.940 --> 03:37.540
So I bring it on the other side and then you divide through by six.

03:37.780 --> 03:41.890
So you should get two gives me two minus.

03:41.910 --> 03:43.620
I have over two.

03:43.970 --> 03:48.000
There's an important equation for us.

03:48.110 --> 03:51.290
I might end up substituting this in the junction rule in a minute.

03:51.520 --> 03:56.750
And from this bottom equation again you do the same thing you isolate what the current one is.

03:56.900 --> 04:01.640
I won simply going to be equal to what should I do here.

04:01.660 --> 04:08.290
I'm going to bring everything on the other side so I'm going to get three over two multiplied by and

04:08.290 --> 04:09.680
minus four.

04:10.090 --> 04:11.960
So here's my equation for I.

04:13.610 --> 04:17.680
Again this gets a little bit tedious but in the end it's pretty straightforward algebra.

04:17.690 --> 04:24.470
Now both of these expressions here I can then I'd like to go back and I substitute things into the junction

04:24.480 --> 04:31.130
rule and once I do that the only unknown is going to be the current I let me go ahead and do that.

04:31.130 --> 04:33.950
So I'm going to get I instead of won.

04:34.460 --> 04:41.170
I substitute I won by this expression so you get three halfs I minus four.

04:41.390 --> 04:45.950
And that must be equal to two minus I over two.

04:45.950 --> 04:49.760
All right now you group all the terms of the I's on one side you group all the other terms on the other

04:49.760 --> 04:50.280
side.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.150
So you get six over here.

04:52.550 --> 04:58.580
What I end up doing here so you get one plus 1.5 when I bring this on the other side I get another half.

04:58.580 --> 05:03.710
So you should get two so three times I won or three times I'd rather.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.470
So you're automatically left with now at the current.

05:06.470 --> 05:09.250
I must be equal to 2 amps.

05:09.670 --> 05:10.130
OK.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.770
Again that's the current everywhere here.

05:14.770 --> 05:17.070
So this is two amps.

05:17.230 --> 05:21.280
Two amps over here two amps going into that junction over here.

05:22.590 --> 05:26.940
All right now let's go ahead now we can substitute our expression back into both of these equations

05:26.940 --> 05:32.630
in the blue boxes so we can find what the currents I want and I to our let's go ahead and do that.

05:32.640 --> 05:39.360
So you get that the current one now is going to be three over two multiplied by two minus four.

05:39.360 --> 05:44.210
And we get get mine is one ups you have minus 1 amp.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.270
What does that tell you.

05:47.770 --> 05:51.190
That simply tells me that my guess was wrong.

05:51.190 --> 05:57.410
It actually should be opposite to this.

05:57.490 --> 06:00.780
So let me go ahead fix it now just so I have it in the right direction.

06:00.940 --> 06:07.030
So actually if I switch it and I make the arrow kind of going in the proper direction that means that

06:07.030 --> 06:08.940
this current now is 1 amp.

06:08.990 --> 06:18.310
So that tells me all right how about the current I to I to is simply equal to two times minus two over

06:18.310 --> 06:19.260
two.

06:19.300 --> 06:26.850
That gives me one amp so that when I did guess correctly and this one is also equal to 1 amp.

06:26.900 --> 06:30.560
Let's go ahead now and make sure this is correct if it's correct.

06:30.590 --> 06:36.060
We should calculate that the voltage between both of those points has to be the same.

06:36.170 --> 06:38.370
Doesn't matter on the path that I take.

06:38.810 --> 06:41.240
Let's go ahead and do this path right down the middle.

06:41.420 --> 06:43.290
If I choose this path what do I get.

06:43.490 --> 06:49.060
Well I'm going to get a voltage drop given by two multiplied by one that's the current.

06:49.340 --> 06:56.350
And then I get a voltage drop of hopes of four when I crossed the battery.

06:57.110 --> 07:02.410
So I get a voltage drop of six volts when I go from this point to that point.

07:02.420 --> 07:08.450
How about now when I go on the outside when I go on the outside while there's only one resistance and

07:08.450 --> 07:11.220
the voltage drop is six multiplied by one.

07:11.450 --> 07:13.850
Look at I get minus six volts.

07:14.330 --> 07:17.990
Actually you can also check this branch over here if you go all the way on the right branch you're also

07:17.990 --> 07:20.340
going to get negative six volts.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.060
OK.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.990
So that works out.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.210
We've got all our currents we've actually solve for this first part done and next part the power supplied

07:29.210 --> 07:34.670
by each source of M.F. are going to go in the other page and figure this out.

07:35.850 --> 07:42.310
And go back to the circuit now we want to find the power supplied by each DMF source we have here we've

07:42.350 --> 07:48.590
got an 8 volt battery so I'll start with that one the power from the evil battery simply the voltage

07:48.590 --> 07:55.130
multiplied by the current flowing through it eight multiplied by 2 gives me 16 watts.

07:55.130 --> 07:57.330
How about the four volt battery.

07:57.830 --> 07:59.240
Oh there's two four volt battery.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.270
Let's call this one number one.

08:01.760 --> 08:02.600
Let's call this one here.

08:02.600 --> 08:09.470
Number two now the power supplied by this one to the voltage multiplied by the current.

08:09.710 --> 08:17.290
Very easy four multiplied by two gives me eight watts How about the power in this one now you've got

08:17.290 --> 08:18.160
to be careful with this one.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.210
Look what happens.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.720
The currents flowing opposite.

08:22.730 --> 08:26.870
So actually the power for this one for volts.

08:26.870 --> 08:28.390
Number two again it's v times.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.040
I again you get four times two.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.540
Oh you don't get four times two.

08:33.710 --> 08:35.560
I am going way too fast here.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.860
The current flowing through it is only one.

08:38.270 --> 08:39.440
So that's four watts.

08:39.440 --> 08:43.700
However we're going to be a little bit careful with this one right because the currents opposite.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.460
Let's go ahead and I'll explain this in just a minute.

08:46.460 --> 08:49.340
Let's find all the power dissipated in these resistors.

08:49.640 --> 08:54.240
So we've got the power dissipated in any resistor remember equations.

08:54.290 --> 08:58.550
The value of the resistance multiplied by the current squared.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.780
So the power dissipated in the 1 ohm resistor.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.680
It's one multiplied by the current squared.

09:06.680 --> 09:15.250
We get four watts the power dissipated and the 2 ohm resistor it's two multiplied by two squared.

09:15.320 --> 09:21.280
That gives me 8 watts the power dissipated in this other two ohm resistor.

09:21.570 --> 09:25.520
So again I'm going to call that number one call this guy here.

09:25.520 --> 09:33.850
Number two the power dissipated in this two ohm resistor the value of r is too and the current is one.

09:34.220 --> 09:40.810
So you get 2 watts and the last one is the power dissipated in the six ohm resistor.

09:41.390 --> 09:44.560
Well again the value of the resistance is six.

09:44.630 --> 09:47.080
The current flowing through it is one.

09:47.140 --> 09:50.880
So a square that you get six watts.

09:50.910 --> 09:53.200
So let's look at everything being dissipated.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.570
What is the total power being dissipated.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.980
Well we get to add all these resistor powers.

09:58.980 --> 09:59.740
Right.

09:59.790 --> 10:06.510
So you get four plus eight plus two plus six.

10:06.570 --> 10:08.910
Looks like we get 12 plus 8.

10:08.940 --> 10:18.070
Gives me 20 watts However look at these we know both of those are supplying power and we get 24 watts

10:18.070 --> 10:20.670
being supplied by both of those batteries.

10:21.950 --> 10:25.190
However we only have 20 that's being dissipated.

10:25.190 --> 10:28.910
And remember I want to go back now to this other case this other case here we have the current kind

10:28.910 --> 10:32.400
of flowing in the opposite direction here.

10:32.480 --> 10:39.210
So that is actually power being absorbed by this battery basically charging up this battery OK.

10:39.530 --> 10:44.090
So that is basically the power or the energy transfer in the circuit.

10:44.090 --> 10:48.550
Most of the energy is being dissipated into heat.

10:48.860 --> 10:51.020
Some of the energy is being absorbed.

10:52.270 --> 10:57.560
And if you add all of those up this guy this guy you're going to get our 24 Watts right here.

10:58.530 --> 10:59.070
OK.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.880
So you just got to be careful you got to look at the direction of the current with respect to the battery

11:02.880 --> 11:07.260
to see whether or not it's power being supplied or it's charging the battery.
