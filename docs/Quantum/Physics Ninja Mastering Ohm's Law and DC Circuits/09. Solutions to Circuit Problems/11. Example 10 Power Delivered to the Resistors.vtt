Hi everybody physics and then you hear I'm going to look at a problem again a DC circuit problem here

00:04.830 --> 00:10.620
and I want to calculate what is the power kind of deliver to the resistor or the power being dissipated

00:10.620 --> 00:14.380
by the resistor would be kind of a maybe a better way to say it.

00:14.490 --> 00:16.410
So we've got a simple circuit here.

00:16.470 --> 00:19.500
You've got one power supplies of 20 power supply.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.790
You have got four resistors they're kind of set up in a way to try to make the problem a little bit

00:23.790 --> 00:24.650
harder.

00:25.050 --> 00:29.990
So let's see how you set up this problem how you can calculate the energy dissipated in those resistors.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.320
So here's the circuit.

00:31.320 --> 00:36.240
I guess the first thing we want to do is just remember how you calculate power in a simple circuit like

00:36.240 --> 00:42.830
this so we dealing with power supplies and batteries actually all three cases the power can be calculated.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.770
Typically if you're talking to will power supplies you can usually just write it like this it's the

00:46.770 --> 00:49.570
voltage multiplied by the current flowing through the battery.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.370
That'll tell you the power being supplied by the battery.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.490
This formula also applies for the power being dissipated.

00:55.490 --> 01:00.210
The only thing you have to remember is that the V for that case is simply the potential drop across

01:00.210 --> 01:01.280
that resistor.

01:01.290 --> 01:07.210
So a lot of times when you're talking about resistors sometimes instead of writing V you multiply her

01:07.320 --> 01:12.660
or you substitute the value of the voltage drop across that resistor which is given by Ohm's law and

01:12.660 --> 01:15.100
you still have the original that I had here.

01:15.300 --> 01:17.830
So this can get combined as our eyes square.

01:17.830 --> 01:21.300
This is kind of a more standard form when you're talking about resistors.

01:21.720 --> 01:25.920
You can also eliminate the current again using Ohm's law if you eliminate the current this kind of the

01:25.920 --> 01:32.750
same the same equation written three different ways and you can write is this V squared over our aim

01:33.370 --> 01:34.260
for what follows.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.270
For the resistors I'll calculate this for the power supply I'll use this form which means I need to

01:39.270 --> 01:40.170
know the current.

01:40.290 --> 01:43.920
I need to know the current flowing through the battery and I need to know the current flowing through

01:43.950 --> 01:45.970
each one of these resistors.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.270
Now there are several loops of this.

01:48.270 --> 01:51.470
There are several branches of the circuit so you have to be a little bit careful.

01:51.480 --> 01:55.680
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to label some currents here I'm going to call the current

01:55.710 --> 01:56.230
over here.

01:56.230 --> 02:00.720
I one that's the current flowing all the way up until this branch.

02:00.990 --> 02:05.040
And that means it's also the same current that's going to flow through that's for ohm resistor down

02:05.040 --> 02:07.510
here this is still the same current one.

02:07.530 --> 02:12.780
Now once it gets to this junction Well part of that current is going to flow down through the 1 ohm

02:12.780 --> 02:13.850
resistor.

02:14.310 --> 02:15.850
Let's call this Aitu.

02:15.960 --> 02:21.350
And part of that current is also going to flow through this branch over here let's call this i3.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.650
So we need to find what those currents are.

02:23.650 --> 02:30.390
Then after I can easily find what power is being dissipated by each one of those first thing I'm going

02:30.390 --> 02:36.010
to do let's actually find how much current is flowing in this section over here what is the current

02:36.020 --> 02:42.220
I want and the easiest way to do this one actually is to try to simplify this network.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.850
This is one of those networks that can simplify using an equivalent resistor.

02:45.870 --> 02:49.860
And the reason I want to do that is because it's the easiest way to find how much current is flowing

02:49.860 --> 02:51.410
through this battery.

02:51.440 --> 02:56.310
So we're going to do first is I'm going to combine everything here and this kind of yellow box because

02:56.310 --> 03:00.240
I've got two resistors here that are in parallel with each other.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.790
So everything in the yellow box here I can combine them.

03:02.790 --> 03:08.130
We call this our equivalent however let me just call it our equivalent.

03:08.260 --> 03:13.500
And we put a one here because it's not a total equivalent resistor it's really only what's in this shaded

03:13.500 --> 03:15.100
yellow area.

03:15.450 --> 03:21.480
All right so hard to resist there is in parallel with each other which means one over our equivalent

03:21.510 --> 03:28.830
which gives me one over one plus one over three this is three over three plus one over three is me for

03:28.830 --> 03:34.700
over three which means that both of those can be combined to give me one equivalent resistor which I've

03:34.710 --> 03:41.970
called our equivalent one equal to three over four ohms so that simplifies it now because that means

03:41.970 --> 03:48.720
that the total equivalent resistor I'm going to have a 2 ohm that is in series with a three over four

03:48.720 --> 03:55.120
ohm resistor that's also in series with a four Omers this there so the total equivalent resistance.

03:55.290 --> 03:58.390
Let me write toto like this for this guy.

03:58.830 --> 04:04.190
It's going to be two plus three or four plus four.

04:04.540 --> 04:09.180
You put things on a common denominator and all four is a common denominator for that.

04:09.190 --> 04:20.180
This will be eight plus three plus 16 eleven twenty seven 27 over 4 is the equivalent resistance of

04:20.450 --> 04:21.820
this entire network.

04:22.590 --> 04:28.770
So once you have this that means that this complicated circuit can be simplified into something that

04:28.770 --> 04:38.040
simply looks like this a 20 volt battery that is connected to one equivalent resistance equal to 27

04:38.090 --> 04:41.740
over four.

04:41.790 --> 04:42.830
That's pretty simple.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.690
That's the simplest circuit you can ask for.

04:45.690 --> 04:49.980
Again this would be 27 over for ohms.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.970
So you can actually solve for what that current is and really what that current is that's the current

04:53.970 --> 04:58.530
flowing through the battery which is also the current flowing through the tool resistor which is the

04:58.530 --> 05:00.900
current flowing through the forum is there.

05:01.470 --> 05:06.360
So at the end what you end up getting here is that you get 20.

05:06.360 --> 05:11.790
That's the voltage across this branch has to be the voltage drop across the equivalent resistance which

05:11.790 --> 05:15.810
is the value of the resistance 20 over four multiplied by the current.

05:15.810 --> 05:19.460
And it's really the current I won here that I'm looking in.

05:19.530 --> 05:26.550
So with this you're able to solve for what the current is in that leftmost branch of the circuit I won

05:26.550 --> 05:30.800
gives me 80 over 27 amps.

05:32.060 --> 05:33.650
I mean to leave things at a fraction.

05:33.650 --> 05:40.670
You can write as a decimal if you wanted to but I kind of like it as a fraction like this just my own

05:40.670 --> 05:42.250
personal preference.

05:42.260 --> 05:46.530
All right so we're almost done now we need to find what are the current Aitu and i3.

05:46.700 --> 05:52.460
For that I notice here that I have a junction here I have some current flowing into the junction and

05:52.460 --> 05:55.230
I also have some current flowing out of the junction.

05:55.250 --> 06:00.440
This means that I can write a junction rule which says whatever flows in has to be what's flowing out.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.400
This is Aitu plus i3.

06:03.470 --> 06:04.310
Now I'm not quite done.

06:04.310 --> 06:05.970
I know what I one is.

06:06.140 --> 06:13.760
However I don't know what I 2 and I 3R But given that both of these resistors the one and the three

06:13.760 --> 06:16.520
ohm resistor are in parallel with each other.

06:16.550 --> 06:21.510
That means that the voltage drop across each branch here has to be the same.

06:21.860 --> 06:26.850
So the voltage drop across the 1 ohm resistor is simply one.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.380
That's the value of the resistance multiplied by the current flowing through it.

06:31.340 --> 06:37.850
Aitu that has to be equal to the voltage drop across these three ohm resistor which is three multiplied

06:37.850 --> 06:42.720
by the current flowing through that resistor i3.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.300
So at the end what you can do now is you can simply solve.

06:45.310 --> 06:49.110
Now we have everything we need in order to solve for what I two and three are.

06:49.130 --> 06:51.300
So let's go ahead and do that.

06:51.350 --> 06:55.370
So we have I one must be equal to OK.

06:55.380 --> 06:59.470
We have to either eliminate two or three let's eliminate Aitu.

06:59.570 --> 07:09.960
So that's three three plus i3 which gives me four i3 So at the end I three is simply I one divided by

07:09.970 --> 07:13.860
four that gives me 20 over 27.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.370
And the last one is Aitu.

07:18.860 --> 07:27.350
Well two is simply three times three three times I three three times 20 over 27 which gives me 60 over

07:27.360 --> 07:29.790
27.

07:29.860 --> 07:33.240
And again everything all the currents are measured in amps here.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.300
OK so we've got our three values of occurrence.

07:36.400 --> 07:41.610
Now let's go ahead on the next page and look at what the power is dissipated in all those three resistors.

07:42.610 --> 07:43.900
So here are my three currents.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.010
I want to i3.

07:47.110 --> 07:52.570
Let's start by the power being supplied to the circuit that's the power being applied by this battery.

07:52.570 --> 07:54.600
This is give it a little b over here.

07:54.610 --> 07:57.760
That's simply the voltage of the battery multiplied by the current.

07:57.880 --> 08:02.080
So it's pretty straightforward it's 20 multiplied by how much current was in this branch that was the

08:02.080 --> 08:03.460
current one.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.930
This was 80 over 27.

08:06.430 --> 08:14.740
That means this guy here is 6500 over 27 that's the power being supplied by the battery you could substitute

08:14.740 --> 08:15.670
that in your calculator.

08:15.670 --> 08:22.820
I think I get 59 point to six watts or let's have a look at all these resistors Now let's do the power

08:22.820 --> 08:30.230
being dissipated by the tumor this there the power being dissipated by the Forum resistor power being

08:30.230 --> 08:34.900
dissipated by the one ohm in the last one power being dissipated by the three on.

08:35.330 --> 08:35.780
OK.

08:35.780 --> 08:39.920
Again for this case since I'm looking at resistors I just calculate how much current flows through each

08:39.920 --> 08:40.900
one of those.

08:40.970 --> 08:46.420
It's probably easier to use the power being dissipated as are multiplied by the current squared.

08:46.910 --> 08:52.280
So for the tool I get to multiplied by the current in that branch the current flowing through this tuum

08:52.280 --> 08:55.510
resistor was 80 over 27.

08:55.530 --> 09:07.520
And don't forget the square that all right you square 80 at 64 400 times two is 128 hundred twenty seven

09:07.520 --> 09:15.190
squared is 7:29 all right power being dissipated in the form resistor is four times the same thing same

09:15.190 --> 09:17.950
current.

09:18.070 --> 09:24.230
Remember that current I won was the same everywhere down here same current flowing through the battery.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.730
That was the current one.

09:27.370 --> 09:32.480
All right so that means that the power being dissipated by the form this is simply two times this value.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.420
That's easy.

09:33.670 --> 09:39.330
That's 256 divided by 7:29.

09:39.420 --> 09:43.590
All right the power being dissipated by the one ohm a little bit carefully remember the one on we had

09:43.590 --> 09:49.160
a current Aitu flowing through that one and I too had a magnitude of 60 over 27.

09:49.320 --> 09:55.270
So you get one is the value of the resistance multiplied by 60 over 27.

09:55.290 --> 10:02.400
Don't forget the square at 3600 divided by 7:29.

10:02.480 --> 10:09.490
Again all of these numbers here in Watts Watts and Watts and the last one is the three ohm resistor.

10:09.500 --> 10:13.280
Careful that's not just three times the one ohm because the current is different.

10:13.520 --> 10:22.730
So it's three times the current i3 was 20 over 27 a square that again everything is over 7:29 and what

10:22.730 --> 10:23.030
do you get.

10:23.030 --> 10:26.830
You get three times 20 squared is 400.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.260
Gives me twelve hundred.

10:30.330 --> 10:36.090
Now what I did was I added every single one here so 128 zero zero.

10:36.300 --> 10:40.930
Twenty five thousand six hundred three thousand six hundred and twelve hundred.

10:41.070 --> 10:46.840
You sum all of those up and what you end up getting everything is in over the same common denominator

10:46.840 --> 10:49.270
at 729.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.950
This is forty three thousand two hundred.

10:52.950 --> 10:58.520
That is the total power being dissipated by these four resistors.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.320
Now that doesn't look like the power being supplied.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.090
However you have to put things on a common denominator.

11:04.110 --> 11:08.680
Actually this one is not that obvious but if I would actually left it is Twenty-Seventh squared.

11:08.760 --> 11:15.680
You could have guessed instead of writing 7:29 you write it like this as Twenty-Seventh squared.

11:15.930 --> 11:22.410
And forty three thousand two hundred is actually 16:00 multiplied by 27.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.490
So now you can see what happens.

11:24.600 --> 11:32.760
One of these is going to cross off with one of those and lo and behold you get 16:00 over 27 which equals

11:32.760 --> 11:40.080
fifty nine point to six so the total power being dissipated by the 4 resistors is simply equal to the

11:40.080 --> 11:43.230
total power being delivered to the circuit by the battery.

11:43.230 --> 11:45.400
The energy has to come from somewhere.

11:45.420 --> 11:51.030
Whatever you put in from the battery has to be with being dissipated in those resistors.

11:51.030 --> 11:55.200
All right there you have it folks that's how you kind of tackle a problem like this how I would do it.

11:55.250 --> 12:00.450
I like to deal with fractions if you wanted to put in just punch those numbers in your calculator you're

12:00.450 --> 12:01.630
free to do so.

12:01.650 --> 12:03.590
Just be careful at the end when you add those up.

12:03.590 --> 12:10.050
You might end up with a fraction or a decimal off one one hundredth of a watt off I wouldn't be too

12:10.050 --> 12:11.110
concerned about that.

12:11.310 --> 12:15.250
But just be a little bit careful with the rounding you might not get them equal to each other if you're

12:16.860 --> 12:17.910
if you're not cautious.
