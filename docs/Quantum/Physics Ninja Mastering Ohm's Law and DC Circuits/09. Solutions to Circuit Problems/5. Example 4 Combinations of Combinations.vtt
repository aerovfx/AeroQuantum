00:00.630 --> 00:05.760
All right in this example we're asked to find the equivalent resistance of this combination here for

00:05.760 --> 00:06.650
resistors.

00:06.870 --> 00:12.630
So I think what I would first start with is just first notice that both of these guys here in this shaded

00:12.630 --> 00:14.760
area both of those guys are in parallel.

00:14.910 --> 00:20.970
So let's start by simplifying both of those in the way you simplified that both of those is just remember

00:20.970 --> 00:21.800
the formula.

00:22.220 --> 00:26.470
So I'm going to call that our equivalent and that mentally put a little one over here.

00:26.910 --> 00:35.010
That's simply one over four plus one over 12 which you can do is you can put things on a common denominator

00:35.010 --> 00:37.400
here 12 is kind of a good choice.

00:37.440 --> 00:43.380
This here is three over 12 plus one over 12 gives me for over 12.

00:43.920 --> 00:51.080
You take the inverse of that are equivalent one then gives me three homes.

00:51.840 --> 00:58.140
Now just remember that if you only have two of them you can also quickly just write that down by simply

00:58.140 --> 01:06.600
multiplying them and divided by the sum you multiply you get 48 over 16.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.570
That also gives you three homes.

01:09.570 --> 01:14.520
OK so we've simplified everything here into three homes and now what you should do is now you should

01:14.520 --> 01:18.820
combine the three homes with everything here.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.150
So with the five.

01:20.780 --> 01:25.980
Right because the three arm which is the equivalent of both of those is now in series with this 5 ohm

01:25.980 --> 01:27.340
resistor.

01:27.360 --> 01:34.210
So how do we combine both of those I'm going to call this our equivalent to not squared but number 2.

01:34.430 --> 01:38.250
So that is simply going to be five plus three.

01:38.270 --> 01:40.410
And then there gives me 8.

01:40.490 --> 01:44.520
So that's everything here in this bottom branch gives me 8 ohms.

01:44.810 --> 01:45.830
And now what am I left with.

01:45.830 --> 01:49.240
Well I'm left with an 8 ohm resistor down here which is everything.

01:49.490 --> 01:50.560
Maybe box it up here.

01:50.570 --> 02:00.090
Everything kind of in this red circle is now going to be in parallel with this 24 ohm resistor and everything

02:00.090 --> 02:03.300
and this we just solve for this was 8 ohms.

02:03.530 --> 02:04.280
So what does that mean.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.890
Well at the end now you can solve for the total equivalent resistance.

02:08.210 --> 02:11.750
Let me call it total because this is the last step we have to do it again.

02:11.770 --> 02:12.020
Oh.

02:12.050 --> 02:13.670
Both of those are in parallel.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.660
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the same trick as I previously used to I multiply them and

02:17.660 --> 02:19.780
I divide by the sum.

02:19.850 --> 02:22.590
Since there's only two of them I think that works kind of nice.

02:22.610 --> 02:27.480
So if you multiply them you get 24 multiplied by 8.

02:27.980 --> 02:33.010
And now if you divide that by 24 plus 8.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.360
All right that's the sum.

02:34.510 --> 02:36.580
So at the end let's try to simplify this a little bit.

02:36.580 --> 02:48.280
24 multiplied by 8 divided by 32 32 goes in the 8 4 times and 24 goes into 4 6 times.

02:48.610 --> 02:54.260
So at the end this complete network here can simply be replaced by one equivalent resistor.

02:54.270 --> 03:03.870
So I can put Point 8 here an equivalent resistor of six ohms and then go all the way to point B and

03:03.870 --> 03:05.760
I have basically the equivalent

03:08.130 --> 03:11.940
current in the equivalent voltage across both of those points.

03:11.990 --> 03:17.880
OK so there you go you have this is kind of a good one because you can kind of involves some parallel

03:17.880 --> 03:21.780
combinations with series and then another parallel case.

03:21.780 --> 03:24.730
So kind of a good practice problem for you guys.
