00:00.180 --> 00:02.790
Hi everybody today we're going to look at a multi loop circuit.

00:02.790 --> 00:08.250
I've got a great surrogate here for he has got three branches got three batteries and three resistors

00:08.520 --> 00:14.010
and a goal today is to calculate what the current is through each branch.

00:14.310 --> 00:19.110
So in order to do that we're going to use Kirchhoff's rules the loop rule and the junction rule in order

00:19.110 --> 00:21.990
to set up a equation then solve for what the currents are.

00:21.990 --> 00:27.240
So this is all we've got we've got three batteries this is a 20 volt battery 10 and a 30 volt battery

00:27.530 --> 00:32.520
and we got these three resistors here just kind of random numbers here two four and five ohms and what

00:32.520 --> 00:37.170
we want to do we want to find the current in each of the three resistors.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.560
The first thing to keep in mind here is although you've probably learned about what an equivalent resistance

00:42.560 --> 00:48.550
is for this problem here you can't really combine these in series or parallel.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.860
Right you might say well both of these are in parallel however you can't because there are also batteries

00:52.860 --> 00:53.470
here.

00:53.640 --> 00:55.500
So that actually will not work.

00:55.500 --> 01:01.050
So you've got to be a little bit careful with this not not all circuits can be simplified using equivalent

01:01.050 --> 01:07.290
resistors like this at least not in the traditional sense of using combinations of resistors in series

01:07.290 --> 01:08.370
and directly in parallel.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.410
So be careful not in this problem.

01:10.410 --> 01:13.580
However we can still solve it using Kirchhoff's rules.

01:13.860 --> 01:18.840
So in order to do that when I'm going to do is I'm going to start by labeling all these points and I

01:18.840 --> 01:28.200
just kind of arbitrarily going to call them A B C D E and F and I'm going to do this because what I'm

01:28.200 --> 01:31.130
going to start doing loops I just want to identify which loops I'm doing.

01:31.140 --> 01:35.910
So we're very clear now two of these points here are actually even more specific I can actually make

01:35.910 --> 01:39.790
these blue a point a blue and I'm also going to make point the blue.

01:40.050 --> 01:45.590
And at these points I could apply what is called a junction roll.

01:45.930 --> 01:49.230
So how would you apply Kirchhoff's junction rule to these points.

01:49.510 --> 01:54.390
Well Kirchhoff's junction junction rule tells you that whatever current flows into the junction has

01:54.390 --> 01:56.620
that be the current that flows out of that junction.

01:56.910 --> 02:01.350
Well as it stands right now there is nothing labeled on this diagram so you can't even really write

02:01.350 --> 02:02.530
a junction rule.

02:02.580 --> 02:07.390
So step number one is you have to pick a direction for the current.

02:07.440 --> 02:09.990
Now you might say well how do I do that.

02:09.990 --> 02:14.810
Actually it doesn't matter which direction you pick for the junction roll.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.720
I've solved tons of these problems.

02:16.830 --> 02:21.600
So I think I got a pretty good idea what's going to happen especially here look it as a 20 volt battery.

02:21.630 --> 02:24.750
And again this side here's the positive side the negative side.

02:24.900 --> 02:27.780
And this one is stronger than the 10 mile battery.

02:27.840 --> 02:32.340
So I'm probably going to guess that the current is going to flow through here and I'm going to call

02:32.340 --> 02:34.020
this one.

02:34.470 --> 02:38.060
Now over here there's only one battery in this outer branch here.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.610
I'm going to guess that the current here is going to flow over here.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.910
I'm going to call it something different.

02:41.910 --> 02:43.870
It's not going to be the same current.

02:43.890 --> 02:47.870
This is going to be current I three in this outer branch and the one down the middle.

02:47.880 --> 02:52.350
I don't know I'm going to guess that it's going to go down and it doesn't matter if I was wrong or if

02:52.350 --> 02:59.560
I'm completely right at the end the solution will tell us whether or not our guest was correct or incorrect.

02:59.580 --> 03:03.270
So this is what I've got so I've got three different branches to the circuit.

03:03.390 --> 03:09.030
Therefore I need three different currents and that's what I'm going to try to solve for what are I one

03:09.130 --> 03:10.770
2 and three.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.330
So the first thing we're to do is we're going to write a junction rule.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.120
We're going to write a junction rule at junction a.

03:16.590 --> 03:19.200
So a junction of the junction rule says whatever follows.

03:19.230 --> 03:20.760
And let's see what goes in.

03:20.820 --> 03:27.570
Well I was going this way I was going down here and it's looking at its I three that goes into the junction.

03:27.920 --> 03:33.240
I3 that has to be equal to whatever current flows out of the junction.

03:33.660 --> 03:36.440
So look we have we've got one that's flowing this way.

03:36.450 --> 03:40.440
I've got I to flowing down in the center branch the way I've got it labeled here.

03:40.440 --> 03:46.930
So that means i3 must be equal to the current flowing out which is one plus two.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.060
That is the junction rule.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.230
Now you can go ahead and say well what about this junction down over here.

03:52.500 --> 03:57.690
If I write the same expression my junction rule for the junction down here a point D What am I going

03:57.690 --> 03:58.100
to find.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.730
What's flowing into the junction.

03:59.970 --> 04:05.670
I have I one flowing into the junction and I also have two flowing into the junction which is this term

04:05.670 --> 04:09.120
over here the second term on the right hand side of my first equation.

04:09.660 --> 04:10.080
And what else.

04:10.080 --> 04:12.480
What's flowing out of the junction here a point.

04:12.550 --> 04:18.420
That's the current I three I three is flowing down this lower section over here and that is the current

04:18.490 --> 04:22.590
i3 which is the same everywhere in this kind of outer branch over here.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.940
So actually you get the same expression whether you choose this point or that point to right.

04:26.940 --> 04:33.090
The junction will are the next thing we want to do now is we want to write the loop rule Kirchoff's

04:33.090 --> 04:35.050
loop rule knowm.

04:35.190 --> 04:37.440
So the loop rule is pretty simple.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.910
You simply have to pick loops.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.380
In this case there are three loops they can actually choose for this circuit and we'll write it down

04:43.380 --> 04:44.840
for all three.

04:44.880 --> 04:52.950
So I'm going to start with a loop that starts at point A B C D and then goes back to A A B C D and then

04:52.950 --> 05:00.840
I'm going to go back to a if I choose that loop and I sum all the voltages across the cories and across

05:00.840 --> 05:07.200
the resistors and I come back to the same point the loop rule says you sum all of those potential differences

05:07.200 --> 05:08.830
across every single element.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.570
You come back to where you start at the end.

05:11.670 --> 05:14.940
There should be no change in electrical potential.

05:14.940 --> 05:20.130
So let's start over here at Point A and I'm going across a battery when you cross a battery when I go

05:20.130 --> 05:21.660
from the negative to the positive.

05:21.750 --> 05:26.510
I get a voltage gain equal to the voltage of the battery.

05:26.520 --> 05:32.220
Now I'm going to cross a 2 ohm resistor and I'm going to cross it in the direction of the current that

05:32.220 --> 05:33.610
I've picked.

05:33.660 --> 05:38.010
So that means that the current flowing from the top to the bottom that means this side here is at a

05:38.010 --> 05:39.630
higher potential than a low on.

05:39.810 --> 05:44.350
So that means there's a potential drop across that resistor and that's given by Ohm's law.

05:44.590 --> 05:51.060
That's simply the resistance times the current the current is flowing through there right now and right

05:51.060 --> 05:56.220
over here at Point C I'm going across a battery now going across a battery from the high potential to

05:56.220 --> 05:57.360
the low potential.

05:57.390 --> 06:04.000
So I get a voltage drop whenever you get a voltage drop you put a negative sign minus 10 volts.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.860
Now I'm at the same potential all the way till I get over here.

06:06.860 --> 06:07.110
All right.

06:07.110 --> 06:11.040
Now look what happens over here in the center Branch I'm going from point to point A.

06:11.310 --> 06:14.080
I am crossing a resistor.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.700
However look what's going on here.

06:15.720 --> 06:21.570
If the current is flowing the positive current is flowing from the top to the bottom here and I'm doing

06:21.570 --> 06:25.270
my loop rule in a way that I'm going from point to point A.

06:25.290 --> 06:29.100
That means I'm going from a low potential to a higher potential.

06:29.100 --> 06:33.630
When you do that you have to have a positive sign here and the positive voltage gain that you're going

06:33.630 --> 06:39.120
to get here when I'm doing my loop rule given by Ohm's law the value of the resistance multiplied by

06:39.120 --> 06:40.950
the current flowing through it.

06:41.490 --> 06:41.820
That's it.

06:41.820 --> 06:45.110
I go back to Point A.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.080
There we go.

06:46.530 --> 06:50.830
So let's call the junction will acquire and one I'm going to call this equation too.

06:51.690 --> 06:56.490
Now let's go ahead and maybe do another loop rule another loop rule I can do now is using the loop A

06:56.490 --> 06:59.510
D E F and then go back to A.

06:59.790 --> 07:04.810
So let's do that one a D E F and then go back to A.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.680
What does that loop will look like.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.630
Again so here I'm actually going around counterclockwise around this loop.

07:11.730 --> 07:15.860
So when I start from and I go down to look what happens now in this case.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.740
I'm crossing this four ohm resistor.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.460
However I'm crossing it and I'm going in the same direction as the current.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.450
That means I'm going from a high potential to a lower potential.

07:25.590 --> 07:34.420
I mean I got I had a voltage drop given by four times Aitu to that's ohms law written for this resistor.

07:34.470 --> 07:38.610
Then I go all the way to the battery I'm going across a battery now from the low potential to the high

07:38.610 --> 07:39.460
potential.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.780
And there's a potential difference equal to 30 volts.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.550
Again 30 volts when I crossed that battery.

07:45.870 --> 07:52.380
And then at the end here I'm going to cross this 5 ohm resistor across a 5 ohm resistor going in the

07:52.380 --> 07:58.080
same direction as the current which means there's a voltage drop given by ohms law which is five times

07:58.830 --> 08:01.860
the value of the resistance multiplied by the current flowing through it.

08:01.860 --> 08:02.460
Be careful here.

08:02.460 --> 08:05.030
This is i3 that flowing through that resistor.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.770
I go back to point a that has to be zero.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.900
This is equation 3.

08:09.930 --> 08:15.030
Now I could have done another loop I could have done this big exterior loop here what will we call that

08:15.030 --> 08:21.360
when we call that a b c d e f back to A.

08:21.600 --> 08:27.660
We've gone through every single point here going around this exterior loop while the first three terms

08:27.930 --> 08:30.920
are going to look exactly like they do in equation 2.

08:31.050 --> 08:33.240
So here you have to have plus 20.

08:33.240 --> 08:38.400
You have to have minus two times I 1 you have to have minus 10.

08:38.400 --> 08:45.240
All right those are the first three terms and then what do I do and then I go over the 30 volt battery

08:45.690 --> 08:49.050
plus 30 and then I go through this five.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.930
This is similar to what I did for Equation 3.

08:51.960 --> 09:00.500
I have to have a voltage drop here equal to 5 3 equal to zero and that is the equation for now.

09:00.510 --> 09:02.870
There are only three unknowns in this problem.

09:02.970 --> 09:09.670
The three unknowns in this problem are either 1 2 and 3.

09:10.170 --> 09:14.940
If you did a little bit of algebra you should know that if you have three unknowns all you need are

09:14.940 --> 09:18.630
three equations in order to solve this.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.480
We have four equations.

09:20.490 --> 09:23.130
We actually have too much information.

09:23.130 --> 09:30.060
Actually it turns out that equation for you would get equation for if you actually simply added equation

09:30.060 --> 09:34.360
2 to Equation 3 and you can check that out for yourself.

09:34.410 --> 09:37.040
This is simply equation 2 plus equation 3.

09:37.100 --> 09:43.440
So equation 4 basically doesnt give us any additional information because its simply the sum of two

09:43.440 --> 09:44.550
other equations.

09:44.550 --> 09:49.230
You see if I sum both of those equations what's going to happen in this equation here you have four

09:49.280 --> 09:55.410
Aitu in this equation you have minus four i.e. two if I sum both of those up those two terms are going

09:55.410 --> 09:58.770
to vanish and then I'll be left with equation for.

09:58.770 --> 10:05.730
So in order to solve this now all we're going to do is we're going to use equation 1 equation 2 and

10:05.730 --> 10:06.840
Equation 3.

10:07.080 --> 10:09.770
And at this point the problem is all algebra.

10:09.870 --> 10:15.720
I've taken care of all the physics simply by writing down the junction rule by labeling the currents

10:15.720 --> 10:22.380
in each branch and by using the loop rule in order to obtain these algebraic expressions.

10:22.410 --> 10:26.300
So let's set them up now and solve for the unknowns and see what the currents are.

10:26.750 --> 10:26.970
OK.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.010
In order to solve for this.

10:28.010 --> 10:33.510
Now here I've rewritten my three equations so my junction rule and then my two Kirchhoff's loop rules

10:33.510 --> 10:34.050
here.

10:34.350 --> 10:38.050
Let me work with equation 2 and 3 and kind of simplify those a little bit.

10:39.450 --> 10:42.270
Basically what I'm going to try to do is I'm going to try to eliminate.

10:42.300 --> 10:49.280
I too and I three from the top equation and I can do that simply by eliminating Aitu from equation too.

10:49.420 --> 10:52.720
And that you can do simply by isolating the current Aitu here.

10:52.740 --> 10:53.980
So how would that look like.

10:54.150 --> 10:55.920
You'd have for Aitu.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.680
And now if I bring everything else on the other on the other side what are you going to end up with

11:00.690 --> 11:04.200
you're going to end up with two times I won.

11:06.680 --> 11:10.700
What else are you going to have 20 minus 10 gives me 10 if I bring that on the other side it's going

11:10.700 --> 11:16.080
to be minus 10 which means that at the end of the day if I divide through by four I'm going to get that.

11:16.160 --> 11:22.700
The current Aitu is simply going to be one divided by two minus.

11:22.910 --> 11:28.620
If I can simplify that 10 over 4 5 over to 2.5.

11:28.630 --> 11:32.890
Are there is an expression now for the current Aitu only in terms of I 1.

11:33.470 --> 11:37.810
Now let's go ahead and simplify the current i3 do something similar over here.

11:37.910 --> 11:48.320
If I bring the 5 I 3 on the other side I get 5 i3 equals to 30 minus four times I had to route 3.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.320
I meant to say 4.

11:51.260 --> 11:56.150
Ok now we could do a little bit more algebra here in order to simplify this.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.650
This here is simply equal to 30 minus.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.860
Let's get rid of Aitu altogether I can get rid of Aitu by substituting the expression I just got up

12:03.860 --> 12:04.650
here.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.760
This is I want over to minus five over five over two.

12:10.550 --> 12:10.940
All right.

12:10.970 --> 12:13.330
So we're almost done here just do a little bit more algebra here.

12:13.360 --> 12:14.620
This is 30.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.480
And this here if I multiply through what am I going to get.

12:17.480 --> 12:25.680
I'm going to get minus two I won over here I'm going to get what's going to be left with plus 10.

12:26.730 --> 12:27.010
OK.

12:27.020 --> 12:31.330
So at the end my expression for I three member here I had five i 3.

12:31.340 --> 12:34.300
So really at the end I got to divide through by five.

12:34.760 --> 12:38.240
So what are we left with we're going to get 30 plus 10.

12:38.240 --> 12:42.090
Gives me 40 minus two I won.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.500
And I can't forget to divide by five.

12:44.510 --> 12:49.270
So this here simplifies nicely to eight minus two over five.

12:49.790 --> 12:51.840
I won.

12:51.890 --> 12:52.270
All right.

12:52.280 --> 12:58.700
So we have two important expressions here we have two simply in terms of Iowa 1 and I have I three here

12:58.700 --> 13:01.100
in terms of I won.

13:01.130 --> 13:06.350
Now what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our junction rule and we're going to substitute

13:06.350 --> 13:11.840
in the expressions for Aitu then i3 and then we're only going to be left with an equation for I won

13:11.840 --> 13:13.800
and I'll be able to solve that current.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.180
So let's go ahead and do that.

13:16.190 --> 13:23.090
So that means we're going to have one plus instead of two here let's substitute our expression.

13:23.360 --> 13:35.090
This is I won over to minus five over to that there has to be equal to I three I three is eight minus

13:35.600 --> 13:43.340
two fifths multiplied by 1 All right look at this expression over here there's only I one is the only

13:43.340 --> 13:45.530
unknown in this expression so let's go back.

13:45.530 --> 13:47.870
Let's group all the Iowan terms together.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.050
This is what it looks like.

13:49.170 --> 13:55.100
You have I won plus I went over to bring this term on the other side.

13:55.100 --> 13:58.430
What are you going to get you getting a plus two fifths.

13:58.470 --> 14:02.140
I won that there must be equal to eight.

14:02.510 --> 14:10.070
Plus there is this term over here five over two I buried in bring it to the other side right at the

14:10.070 --> 14:13.020
end we have to put everything on a common denominator.

14:13.040 --> 14:14.370
It kind of helps.

14:14.700 --> 14:15.480
I could choose 10.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.800
Here is a common denominator for this side.

14:18.080 --> 14:27.130
That here means I'm left with 10 plus five plus for all of this gets multiplied by I won.

14:27.950 --> 14:36.550
And here if I put things on a common denominator you're going to get 16 plus five divided by two.

14:36.560 --> 14:36.860
All right.

14:36.860 --> 14:41.170
So we're nearing the end over here this side.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.050
What do we get right to get 19 over 10

14:45.830 --> 14:47.310
multiplied by I.

14:47.430 --> 14:51.400
And this site here gives me 21 over two.

14:51.560 --> 14:55.130
So you can factor out a two on each side.

14:55.370 --> 15:02.160
We're going to be left with five so the final expression now for I one you have to bring the five over

15:02.160 --> 15:05.080
on this side and you have to divide through by 19.

15:05.370 --> 15:06.210
It's a little bit long.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.390
You got to be careful here.

15:07.500 --> 15:20.040
So five times 21 gives me 105 and divided by 19 years the current for the bridge I won which I had labeled

15:20.040 --> 15:20.940
as this one over here.

15:20.940 --> 15:27.070
This was the current I won here 105 divided by 19.

15:28.410 --> 15:33.990
All right I've solved now for I won let me just kind of make some room here so you don't really need

15:33.990 --> 15:35.250
all this algebra here anymore.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.500
We know what the value of i won his.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.920
Now what I want to do is I want to solve for what I.

15:39.920 --> 15:44.720
Two and Three are given the value of 1.

15:44.730 --> 15:47.830
Now you could just substitute stuff in your calculator.

15:47.970 --> 15:49.460
If you do that you should get that.

15:49.470 --> 15:57.610
I won here 5.5 to 6 amps approximately.

15:57.660 --> 15:59.460
All right so now let's go ahead and find Aitu.

15:59.460 --> 16:04.500
So I to all you have to do is simply substitute the value of i won here.

16:04.500 --> 16:07.430
Now the fractions get a little bit messy but it's kind of good.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.650
Just play around with those things.

16:08.640 --> 16:11.910
You get 105 divided by 19.

16:12.060 --> 16:13.840
And that they don't forget is divided by two.

16:13.860 --> 16:17.650
So you still need at two there and minus five over two.

16:18.340 --> 16:18.720
OK.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.110
So what can I do to simplify this a little bit.

16:21.120 --> 16:26.900
That's 105 19 times to 38.

16:27.350 --> 16:29.430
That when I could do my head.

16:30.060 --> 16:33.830
And how do I put this on a factor of 30.

16:33.830 --> 16:37.240
You multiply both sides by 19.

16:37.320 --> 16:44.700
I will put this on 38 if I do the top Times 19 should get 95 said deal at the end you're left with 10

16:45.090 --> 16:50.860
over 38 which is also 5 over 19.

16:50.880 --> 16:52.930
All right that's the current Aitu.

16:53.000 --> 16:53.990
How about i3.

16:54.050 --> 17:06.760
Well I 3 now simply eight minus two fifths and I won again is 105 over 19 five.

17:06.870 --> 17:11.620
I can get rid of and I can factor out should be 21.

17:11.620 --> 17:15.480
So what are you left with now you're going to be left with eight minus two times.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.900
21 is 42 over 19.

17:18.900 --> 17:25.130
This gets really messy but actually eight times 19 Well eight times 20 is very very easy.

17:25.150 --> 17:26.420
It's 160.

17:26.670 --> 17:32.360
So this here should be 152 minus 42 and all of that is over 19.

17:32.370 --> 17:36.120
So here at the end you're going to be left with 110 over 19.

17:36.420 --> 17:40.230
Actually you could have probably guessed that one because you could have automatically just use the

17:40.230 --> 17:47.070
equation 1 over here to obtain that because you know you have one two or five hundred five over 19 here

17:47.400 --> 17:53.460
and you have two which we just found was five over 19 therefore I 3.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.010
Here has to be 110 over 19.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.370
I substitute numbers for this one.

17:58.560 --> 18:03.930
Five over 19 gives you zero point two six three amps.

18:04.170 --> 18:09.300
And the last one won 10 over 19 doing everything approximately here.

18:09.300 --> 18:20.120
Five point five five point seven eight nine I'm sorry it's correct that seventy nine amps.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.450
So there you have it folks this is just kind of algebra at this point.

18:23.450 --> 18:28.880
Once you have your three equations you pick any method you want in order to solve that and kind of do

18:28.880 --> 18:31.370
it my way I kind of like to leave things in fractions.

18:31.370 --> 18:36.670
It's kind of easy for me to check the answer actually after once I have everything on the common denominator.
