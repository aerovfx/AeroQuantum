00:00.180 --> 00:05.910
All right here's example 6 entitled finding the potential first part says find the potential at points

00:05.940 --> 00:07.730
8 through in this figure.

00:07.800 --> 00:12.200
Assume that the potential point is zero zero volts.

00:12.540 --> 00:15.090
So in order to find the potential at any other point.

00:15.090 --> 00:19.150
Well we're going to have to first kind of go across a resistor across batteries.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.310
This is a single loop circuit.

00:21.360 --> 00:27.060
If it's a single loop circuit it means that all of these resistors are in series with each other and

00:27.060 --> 00:31.320
it doesn't matter even though there is a battery here kind of in between the 5 and the one that doesn't

00:31.320 --> 00:36.080
matter because there is only a single branch so the current has to be the same everywhere.

00:36.120 --> 00:40.800
So what is the total equivalent resistance of this series circuit.

00:40.800 --> 00:50.010
You simply have to add them up one plus five plus five plus five plus five plus one plus for what we

00:50.010 --> 00:50.830
get here.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.910
That's two with ten that gives me 14.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.430
I think something's wrong.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.020
That's 10 11 12.

00:58.020 --> 00:59.010
Try that again.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.030
A ship he's 16 ohms.

01:01.160 --> 01:01.680
OK.

01:01.830 --> 01:04.910
So he gets 16 ohms is the equivalent resistance.

01:04.950 --> 01:12.180
And now if I go through well I'm going to add a 12 volt apply the loop now I get plus 12.

01:12.330 --> 01:13.860
I'm going to lump everything together here.

01:13.860 --> 01:15.480
So we have kind of something like this.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.640
We have the equivalent resistor of the batteries that I'm not going to do anything with them.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.200
It's going to leave them as is.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.560
But this here 16 ohms.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.230
This is my 12 volt battery.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.980
This is my four volt battery.

01:27.200 --> 01:27.590
OK.

01:27.720 --> 01:33.090
So if you apply a loop rule to this one is still going around in the clockwise fashion you get plus

01:33.090 --> 01:35.500
12 when I cross the battery over here.

01:35.520 --> 01:40.280
Now I'm going to get a voltage drop equal to 16 multiplied by the current.

01:40.530 --> 01:45.900
And now when I crossed this battery the fordable battery kind of going from the positive to the negative

01:45.900 --> 01:49.890
I'm going to get a voltage drop and that's four volts.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.040
So at the end this here equals zero if I do one complete loop.

01:55.110 --> 01:56.040
So what are we going to get.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.060
We're going to get 16.

01:57.060 --> 01:59.610
I bring that term on the other side.

01:59.670 --> 02:01.050
This is 12 mine four.

02:01.050 --> 02:02.530
That gives me eight.

02:02.580 --> 02:07.730
So the current at the end is simply equal to 0.5 amps.

02:07.980 --> 02:09.680
So that's the current everywhere.

02:09.690 --> 02:12.460
Let's just write that on the diagram.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.840
Equals zero point five.

02:16.060 --> 02:17.190
And that's how you do it.

02:17.230 --> 02:20.960
And the next thing we want to know is now what is the potential at all these points.

02:21.570 --> 02:26.500
Well I'm going to use the fact that I know that it's 0 over here at Point.

02:27.330 --> 02:32.160
And now I'm going to go across so if I start let's start at point E.S. I met some potential which is

02:32.160 --> 02:33.030
zero.

02:33.060 --> 02:38.620
The first thing I cross now is the 12 volt batteries I get plus 12 volts.

02:38.730 --> 02:42.750
The next thing I cross now is a 1 ohm resistor.

02:42.770 --> 02:49.620
Well if I cross a one ohm resistor I get a voltage drop equal to one ohm multiplied by the current the

02:49.620 --> 02:53.160
current is zero point five and that's it.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.170
Now I'm at this point now I go all the way to point A.

02:56.220 --> 02:59.960
So I must be at some voltage at point A.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.050
Now remember the potential hit point.

03:02.070 --> 03:04.500
E that was given in the problem that was zero.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.930
So we don't have to worry about that term.

03:06.960 --> 03:11.430
So what we're left with here is 12 minus 0.5.

03:11.520 --> 03:17.380
So that means that the voltage up Point A is simply equal to eleven point five volts.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.330
And now you keep doing the same thing.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.240
So we start at point A you can start a point.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.060
Again it doesn't matter.

03:26.060 --> 03:31.110
We've already done this first section so we know this point a is eleven point five.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.410
So let's do that over here.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.260
So this is eleven point five.

03:35.330 --> 03:37.200
That's the potential of point A.

03:37.460 --> 03:47.120
And now I'm going to cross a 5 ohm resistor so I get a drop which is equal to 5 multiplied by 0.5 and

03:47.120 --> 03:51.540
that there has to be equal to the potential at point B right here.

03:52.040 --> 03:52.540
So what do we get.

03:52.550 --> 03:57.920
Eleven point five minus five times point five gives me 2.5.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.060
So 11 minus 2.5 should give me 9 volts.

04:02.360 --> 04:08.410
So VB voltage at point B relative to zero over here has Nine volts.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.100
OK there we go.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.850
What about the next one point see.

04:13.870 --> 04:17.000
Again I'm going to go down a five ohm resistor.

04:17.050 --> 04:20.670
Whenever I go down a 5 ohm resistor I just did that point.

04:20.680 --> 04:24.660
I get a voltage drop which is given to 2.5 volts.

04:24.850 --> 04:33.830
So that means I get nine minus 2.5 so the voltage at Point C is nine minus five times zero point five.

04:34.480 --> 04:41.770
She gives me 6.5 volts of voltage at Point C 6.5.

04:41.880 --> 04:48.040
Working my way around the loop over there and the last one may be point D.

04:48.150 --> 04:48.420
All right.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.640
Now pointy is a little trickier.

04:49.650 --> 04:53.370
So point C we just calculated that was 6.5 volts.

04:53.370 --> 04:56.200
So I can write that down the voltage at Point C.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.150
Now I'm going to go toward Point D.

04:58.200 --> 05:04.020
So I first going across a battery and I'm going to get a drop of four volts and I get a drop in this

05:04.020 --> 05:04.390
case.

05:04.430 --> 05:07.410
I'm going from the positive side to the negative side.

05:07.740 --> 05:11.430
And then I cross a one ohm resistor.

05:11.430 --> 05:17.160
If I cross a one ohm resistor I know I get a voltage drop across this one ohm resistor equal to half

05:17.160 --> 05:23.280
a volt so minus another half a volt just did that in the first part and that there has to be equal to

05:23.280 --> 05:25.600
the voltage at Point D.

05:25.620 --> 05:31.760
So to get the voltage at Point C is six point five minus 4.5.

05:32.230 --> 05:37.670
So voltage of point D gives me 2 volts.

05:37.740 --> 05:43.110
So whenever you are asked for the potential at a specific point well what you have to do is you simply

05:43.110 --> 05:43.710
go around.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.030
You don't do a complete loop.

05:45.030 --> 05:50.310
Now you start at a point so you write down the potential at that point and then you move to the other

05:50.310 --> 05:50.740
point.

05:50.760 --> 05:55.920
So when you get to the other point the potential has to be equal to the potential at that point.

05:55.920 --> 06:00.450
All right so this is kind of how you step through and find the potential differences or the potential

06:00.450 --> 06:02.760
at any point on the circuit.

06:02.760 --> 06:04.410
All right so that's it for that one.

06:04.410 --> 06:05.950
Now let's do the energy transfer.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.430
So the energy transfer once you know the current And you know the value of the resistors everywhere

06:11.430 --> 06:13.350
and let me kind of delete all of this stuff.

06:13.360 --> 06:18.090
Now we know the current is 0.5 and that's really all we need.

06:18.120 --> 06:25.560
So for Part B let's calculate the power supplied by the 12 volt battery.

06:26.950 --> 06:32.430
The power supplied by the 12 volt battery is given by the voltage or the battery multiplied by the current

06:32.430 --> 06:34.020
flowing through it.

06:34.020 --> 06:38.420
So this simply gives me 12 multiplied by 0.5.

06:38.430 --> 06:40.110
That should give me six watts

06:43.640 --> 06:44.610
pretty straightforward.

06:44.750 --> 06:45.440
What about now.

06:45.440 --> 06:53.990
What is the power dissipated these resisters Well we can find the total power total power dissipated

06:55.070 --> 07:03.230
by the resistors and just call this it's the power dissipated in the one on plus the power dissipated

07:03.250 --> 07:10.220
by the five ohm Plus the power dissipated in the other five ohm Plus the power dissipated in the other

07:10.220 --> 07:14.800
one ohm and the last one the power dissipated in the forum.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.360
OK.

07:16.430 --> 07:21.590
Now the power dissipated in every resistor there is simply the value of the resistance multiplied by

07:21.590 --> 07:23.360
the current squared.

07:23.930 --> 07:27.160
However the current is the same for each one of those.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.350
Remember the power dissipated in the resistor.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.810
Kind of easy to write it like this.

07:32.810 --> 07:36.950
And the currents the same is 0.5 for each one of those.

07:36.950 --> 07:42.350
The thing that's different is the resistance is different so I can factor out an I squared for each

07:42.350 --> 07:45.260
one of those and I simply have to add all of these up.

07:45.290 --> 07:51.910
So that's one plus five plus five plus one plus for that's simply the equivalent resistance of 16.

07:52.550 --> 08:00.230
So if you get one half squared multiplied by 16 or one half squared gives me a quarter a quarter of

08:00.230 --> 08:01.950
16 gives me four.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.810
So you get four watts.

08:03.950 --> 08:10.240
That's the total energy being dissipated by all these resistors.

08:10.250 --> 08:13.820
All right what about the power associated with this four volt battery.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.260
What do we get.

08:16.270 --> 08:21.280
Well it's the voltage of the battery multiplied by the current flowing through it.

08:21.370 --> 08:25.740
In this case it's four multiplied by a half.

08:26.110 --> 08:28.250
What if we get 2 watts.

08:29.110 --> 08:29.490
All right.

08:29.490 --> 08:32.040
So let's talk about the energy transfers.

08:32.320 --> 08:40.660
So we get this 12 volt battery here which supplies six watts six joules schedule per second of energy

08:42.830 --> 08:46.630
and we get all these resistors here that dissipate 4 watts.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.670
So how does that how do we square this 2 watts over here.

08:49.670 --> 08:51.950
What happens to this 2 watts.

08:51.980 --> 08:55.640
Notice that if you add both of those you're going to get are six.

08:55.690 --> 08:56.200
Right.

08:56.540 --> 09:03.050
And what this means and if you look at the way this battery is set up here basically some energy here

09:03.050 --> 09:05.800
is being dissipated being converted into heat.

09:06.290 --> 09:12.590
And the other parts this two watts is basically energy being stored by this battery or basically charging

09:12.590 --> 09:18.170
up this battery and the rate at which energy is being transferred to Watts.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.550
OK.

09:19.910 --> 09:23.210
So that is the energy transfer in the simple circuit.

09:23.390 --> 09:28.490
Now if the battery was the other way what you would find first you'd find a lot more current and then

09:28.490 --> 09:33.360
all that energy would be dissipated into heat you wouldn't be charging up the battery in that case.

09:33.380 --> 09:33.920
OK.

09:34.220 --> 09:39.860
So you have to be careful when batteries are flipped with respect to a battery that's more powerful

09:39.860 --> 09:42.440
or that has a higher potential difference.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.920
Some of the energy being supplied by the circuit is simply going to be absorbed by that other battery.
