00:00.900 --> 00:02.540
All right here's another problem here.

00:02.700 --> 00:04.670
It's called relating powers.

00:04.680 --> 00:09.990
The problem with our numbers I would know who didn't put any numbers in this one so it is a circuit.

00:09.990 --> 00:11.520
We have three resistors.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.280
This is our one our two and our three are simply two times R1.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.250
Just write it like this.

00:19.500 --> 00:20.250
OK.

00:20.640 --> 00:29.610
Now if p is the power delivered to our one what is the power delivered to our two and our three from.

00:29.640 --> 00:31.450
So how do we solve a problem like this.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.370
Well I think what I would first do is I would just assume there numbers there and what would I do if

00:35.370 --> 00:38.560
there were numbers there I would probably calculate what the power is.

00:38.850 --> 00:43.150
So in order to calculate what the power is you need to find what is the current everywhere.

00:43.470 --> 00:45.720
So let's find the current everywhere in this section.

00:45.720 --> 00:49.600
Now the curve is not going to be a number it's going to be written in terms of our one maybe are two

00:49.630 --> 00:53.480
and three in the MFA of power supply.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.970
So let's go ahead and do that first thing I would do is I would combine both of these.

00:57.990 --> 01:00.480
These are in parallel with each other.

01:00.720 --> 01:07.670
If I combine both of those kind of group them together you multiply them and divided by the sum.

01:07.680 --> 01:17.010
What do you get called that are equivalent when you multiply them you get 4 R1 squared.

01:17.070 --> 01:23.730
Divide by the sum you get four are one force cancel out our one cancels out look at that you're left

01:23.730 --> 01:25.050
with R1.

01:25.350 --> 01:29.060
So both of those that each had a value of two times are one.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.010
Anyway they get when you combine them in parallel.

01:32.030 --> 01:34.350
They're equivalent to simply one are one.

01:34.590 --> 01:41.970
So this total circuit over here can be simplified now because I simply have are one that is in series

01:41.970 --> 01:43.260
with another R1.

01:43.260 --> 01:50.400
So the total thing here the simple equivalent circuit is simply an equivalent resistance equal to two

01:50.400 --> 01:51.370
R1.

01:51.510 --> 01:54.600
And this is still the method of battery.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.000
So that automatically tells you now that the current

02:00.640 --> 02:07.410
simply the MF of the battery divided by the total equivalent resistance which is two times R1.

02:07.510 --> 02:08.000
OK.

02:08.140 --> 02:09.270
So that's the current.

02:09.550 --> 02:14.770
So now if you wanted to write down an expression of what is the power now for example being delivered

02:14.770 --> 02:16.420
by the battery let's calculate that.

02:16.450 --> 02:22.900
So the power being delivered by the battery or by the E-Myth is the value of the IMF multiplied by the

02:22.900 --> 02:27.710
current current which is calculated.

02:27.780 --> 02:32.790
So at the end you simply square the EMI for the battery divided by two times that resistance one.

02:32.850 --> 02:37.380
That's the power being delivered by the battery.

02:37.380 --> 02:41.820
All right let's calculate the expression now what is the power being delivered in this resistance over

02:41.820 --> 02:42.890
here.

02:43.160 --> 02:46.860
Well again the power being dissipated by that resistance are one.

02:47.580 --> 02:54.050
It's the value of the resistance R1 multiplied by the current squared the current.

02:54.060 --> 02:59.910
We just calculated the same current whatever current was flowing through my equivalent resistance is

02:59.910 --> 03:04.380
the same current flowing through this resistance R1.

03:04.410 --> 03:04.690
All right.

03:04.690 --> 03:06.110
Now take care of everything here.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.930
We get square.

03:08.970 --> 03:12.180
This becomes for this becomes our one squared.

03:12.180 --> 03:13.910
You can cross out one of those.

03:14.250 --> 03:19.150
So you're left with over for a four or one.

03:19.720 --> 03:25.170
And actually what we're doing here in the problem they call this the power that is the power delivered

03:25.170 --> 03:26.300
to our one.

03:26.610 --> 03:33.000
So this here is actually the power of call that PR one but this is really what they are it's defined

03:33.000 --> 03:35.250
in the problem.

03:35.640 --> 03:42.720
So if that's my power how much power is delivered to each one of those well.

03:42.770 --> 03:46.250
Do we know how much current is flowing through each one of those.

03:46.790 --> 03:51.830
Well think about here we have a junction and we have how much current Over here we have that current

03:52.640 --> 03:55.190
coming into the junction.

03:55.190 --> 04:00.110
So it has to be the same current now flowing out of the junction or whatever goes in.

04:00.230 --> 04:02.550
We know this is what's going in.

04:03.140 --> 04:09.230
And now if these resistors are the exact same that means that this current is simply going to split

04:09.230 --> 04:10.080
in half.

04:10.160 --> 04:15.560
That's the only way you can have the same voltage across each resistor because they're all the same.

04:15.560 --> 04:22.060
So the voltage must split in equal parts so that means that the current up here let's call it maybe

04:22.280 --> 04:28.840
to this current Aitu is simply going to be this guy I divided by two.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.400
This is the current Aitu flowing in each branch.

04:33.400 --> 04:39.110
So that means you can calculate the power being dissipated for example by the resistor are two.

04:40.090 --> 04:44.470
So it's the value of the resistance which is two times are one.

04:44.740 --> 04:49.960
That's what R2 is defined as multiplied by the current squared.

04:49.960 --> 04:51.560
Now the currents squared was a what.

04:51.580 --> 04:55.810
Well it's I too was going to write it like this.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.220
Just substitute the entire thing in there it's not over to our one because don't forget I'm dividing

05:02.220 --> 05:02.700
by two.

05:02.700 --> 05:08.830
So the current is actually for our one and I have to square it.

05:09.010 --> 05:17.510
Right now we have to take care of everything so we have to our one and we have e squared before turns

05:17.510 --> 05:19.270
into 16 after I square it.

05:19.280 --> 05:22.400
And here I have our 1 squared.

05:22.430 --> 05:28.340
Now you can cross out a bunch of things and cross out this you're left with eight in cross out this

05:28.340 --> 05:31.730
are one you're left with this one.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.340
Now clean things up a little bit.

05:33.380 --> 05:37.360
You get enough of the battery squared.

05:37.550 --> 05:41.780
And at the bottom here you still have my eight and R 1.

05:42.230 --> 05:45.550
So this is the power being dissipated by the resistance are two.

05:45.620 --> 05:50.840
It's also equal to the power dissipated by the resistance are three because they're the exact same value

05:52.230 --> 05:57.170
and actually now if you check it out it should work out right.

05:57.170 --> 06:02.880
Remember this was the power being delivered by the battery.

06:02.920 --> 06:08.810
This is the power being dissipated in the resistance are one.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.290
We have two of these.

06:11.350 --> 06:17.680
Two of those powers that are being dissipated by those resistances are two and are three.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.310
Actually if you add both of these up you should get this value.

06:21.310 --> 06:23.760
Check it out for yourself so you going to get a quarter here.

06:23.860 --> 06:28.240
You get two eighths over here that's another quarter or a quarter and a quarter gives you a half.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.000
So that's all going to work out.

06:30.430 --> 06:35.030
So now if you relate this power to the other one it's simply going to be half right.

06:35.050 --> 06:40.630
So each one of those is simply the power be divided by 2.

06:41.230 --> 06:48.770
So if p is the power delivered to our one that means P over to is being delivered to each one of these

06:48.770 --> 06:53.270
resistors.

06:53.810 --> 06:56.880
All right well hopefully you've got that one.

06:56.960 --> 07:01.510
Sometimes these can be a little bit complicated but I always suggest just assume there are numbers there

07:01.510 --> 07:06.800
and just precede the exact same way you normally would except this time you just have to keep all the

07:06.800 --> 07:08.000
variables of the way they are.
