00:00.720 --> 00:07.590
All right here's example 15 called the unknown resistance in the circuit over here the reading of this

00:07.680 --> 00:09.520
e-meter.

00:09.570 --> 00:16.910
They say it's going to be the same whether or not you keep the switches open or whether it's closed.

00:16.990 --> 00:22.650
That's kind of a key thing right this current in that upper brain is going to be the same whether both

00:22.650 --> 00:24.630
of them are open or both of them are close.

00:24.660 --> 00:28.740
The question is how do you find this unknown resistance.

00:28.740 --> 00:29.030
All right.

00:29.040 --> 00:33.520
So first I'm going to do the case when both of them are open.

00:33.660 --> 00:37.480
Let's have a look at what happens when it's open.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.440
So let's look at where the current can go.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.260
So the current is probably going to flow down here up here.

00:42.300 --> 00:49.210
Now if it's open there's not going to be any current here because this here basically is infinite resistance.

00:49.320 --> 00:55.720
So the current must go up here it must go through this ammeter current must go over here now any current

00:55.720 --> 00:56.610
is going to flow down here.

00:56.610 --> 01:00.050
No because look at it it's open that's infinite resistance.

01:00.210 --> 01:02.980
So the current basically just going to go around this loop.

01:03.030 --> 01:10.180
So actually when both of them are open this is basically nothing more than a single loop circuit.

01:10.350 --> 01:14.550
So that means that we can actually find what that current is it has to be the same current flowing through

01:14.550 --> 01:16.640
the battery.

01:16.650 --> 01:22.900
So in this case we're going to do now since it's a single loop I can use an equivalent resistor and

01:22.900 --> 01:25.950
equivalent resistance is simply you simply add them up.

01:25.950 --> 01:35.380
They're all in series with each other 300 plus 100 plus 50 gives me 450 ohms.

01:36.540 --> 01:38.860
All right the battery is 1.5 volts.

01:39.090 --> 01:43.890
So automatically I can calculate what that current is and I'm going to call the current up here let's

01:43.890 --> 01:44.760
call it.

01:45.030 --> 01:49.140
I won and right now it's the same everywhere.

01:49.170 --> 01:54.690
However in the next problem when both switches are open it's not necessarily going to be the same.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.250
So I'm going to call the current I want up here.

01:57.300 --> 01:59.130
So in this case I'm allowed to find one.

01:59.130 --> 02:04.380
It's simply the voltage of the battery divided by my equivalent resistance.

02:04.380 --> 02:09.120
This is 1.5 over 450.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.890
This is the same thing as on over 300.

02:13.450 --> 02:19.470
Three point three three multiply times ten of them minus three so very small current the resistance

02:19.470 --> 02:20.660
is pretty big.

02:21.170 --> 02:21.370
All right.

02:21.390 --> 02:22.510
That's why it's open.

02:22.530 --> 02:24.850
Now let's do the case when it's closed.

02:25.140 --> 02:27.320
So let me clean up this diagram now.

02:27.390 --> 02:31.950
Actually one is close the problem tells us that the current one up here is going to be the same because

02:31.950 --> 02:34.260
the reading in the ammeter is the same.

02:34.410 --> 02:35.930
So you have to keep that in mind.

02:36.240 --> 02:40.980
So now all we're going to have is we're going to have this current one which we just solved for this

02:40.980 --> 02:46.710
value right here and that's going to be the same whether or not the switches are open or closed so let's

02:46.710 --> 02:52.530
close them up and let me solve the problem now when it's closed.

02:53.310 --> 02:57.840
Now you might not know exactly how to solve this right now but we're asked at the end to find the unknown

02:57.840 --> 03:02.300
resistance so we're really going to have to introduce this unknown resistance.

03:02.340 --> 03:06.830
So let me find some points over here maybe Let's define this as a junction I can call this point.

03:06.850 --> 03:11.550
Hey this is another junction over here that's called Point B.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.630
What else do we know about it.

03:12.630 --> 03:18.710
While we know that this 100 ohm resistor is actually in parallel with this one.

03:19.200 --> 03:23.040
So you know that the voltage across has to be the same right.

03:23.100 --> 03:27.790
The voltage across this resistance must be the same as the voltage across this one.

03:28.440 --> 03:34.050
Well I think we can calculate the voltage across this 100 ohm resistor because we know the current because

03:34.050 --> 03:37.350
the current is the same for both cases.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.040
So let's maybe start with that.

03:39.450 --> 03:48.990
So the voltage across the 100 ohm resistor is what well the value of the resistance is 100 multiplied

03:48.990 --> 03:50.530
by the current flowing through it.

03:50.550 --> 03:52.970
In this case is the current one.

03:53.700 --> 04:00.770
So we get 100 multiplied by 1 over 300 or three point three three times ten to the minus three.

04:00.840 --> 04:07.260
We're left with one over 3 volts so that there is the voltage between this point and that point.

04:07.260 --> 04:11.010
So actually we know the voltage across this unknown resistance.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.450
So let's define the current in a branch.

04:13.450 --> 04:17.950
Now the current that branch let's just call it I of our.

04:18.180 --> 04:25.470
So we know automatically know now that the voltage across must be equal to this unknown resistance multiplied

04:25.470 --> 04:28.920
by whatever current is flowing through that resistance.

04:28.920 --> 04:34.050
So this is an important equation on the box that up when I have to come back to it.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.360
Now the reason you can't just solve this right now is because you don't know what the value of the resistance

04:38.360 --> 04:38.840
is.

04:39.090 --> 04:43.440
But you also don't know what the current flowing through here is.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.720
All we know is the currents in this upper branch.

04:47.030 --> 04:53.700
However if we somehow knew what is the current in this main branch then maybe we can calculate what

04:53.760 --> 04:55.340
I Ariz.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.340
So let's go see how can we calculate the current in the main branch.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.280
Well maybe we can do a loop.

05:02.280 --> 05:08.190
Right we know the voltage across a and b maybe we can just do apply a loop rule.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.660
Let's go ahead and do that.

05:09.660 --> 05:14.560
The first thing we're going to notice is what happens over here when the switch is closed.

05:14.820 --> 05:19.650
Member you're going to have some current that's going to flow into another junction over here and the

05:19.650 --> 05:21.650
current now splits up.

05:21.780 --> 05:27.930
However you know that the voltage from let's call this point C Let's call this point D.

05:28.260 --> 05:34.190
The difference in voltage between points C and point D has to be equal to zero.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.670
All right if I go straight down from this point to that point there is no resistance here in this wire

05:39.900 --> 05:47.280
which automatically tells me that the current flowing out here through this 50 ohm resistor must be

05:47.280 --> 05:53.750
equal to zero because the only way you can have that if there's no voltage drop across here there's

05:53.760 --> 06:00.720
no voltage drop when I go across here and the only way I can have that is if the current is zero.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.490
So again all the current now is simply going to go through the battery.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.880
It's going to go up here some of it's going to go through the 100 ohm resistor.

06:07.950 --> 06:11.700
Some of that's going to go through the unknown resistance and then it's going to go down this path from

06:11.700 --> 06:14.110
C to D.

06:14.130 --> 06:17.700
All right so we can actually do a loop so let's go ahead and apply a loop rule.

06:17.760 --> 06:22.510
I'm going to start at point D and I'm going to go I have to introduce here.

06:23.370 --> 06:28.740
I'm going to go just around this big upper loop here so I'm going to go from D to A to B C and then

06:28.740 --> 06:30.330
come back.

06:30.330 --> 06:37.210
So first thing you get now is a voltage gain 1.5 volt an across the battery.

06:37.410 --> 06:43.710
Then I get a voltage drop the voltage drop is going to be 300 multiplied by the current in this branch.

06:43.710 --> 06:49.470
What are we going to call this current Let's just call it the current I in this case.

06:49.730 --> 06:50.850
All right.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.540
Now I've decided to go up here.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.260
Well I already know the voltage drop going from A to B.

06:56.700 --> 07:03.590
I just calculated that it's one third So minus zero point three three three.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.320
That's it.

07:05.370 --> 07:09.300
Now I go to point C and I go back to point D What am I left with.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.720
I go down and that's equal to zero.

07:12.560 --> 07:17.340
Well this is a useful equation because look at the only unknown in this equation is that letter II is

07:17.340 --> 07:19.870
the current and this other branch.

07:20.310 --> 07:21.850
Let's go ahead and find that.

07:21.940 --> 07:26.580
So the current I then is simply going to be 1.5 minus

07:29.440 --> 07:31.440
all of this is over 300.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.290
So here's the value of the current.

07:33.310 --> 07:41.610
I substituted numbers in the calculator and here's what I got 10 of them minus three amps.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.320
So let's have a look now at our junction.

07:43.360 --> 07:50.410
So we have a current I going in and how much current is going out while his current one which is going

07:50.410 --> 07:57.010
through the top branch and there's some of that current Now that's going through this unknown resistance.

07:57.550 --> 08:01.220
But look what I know in this equation I just calculated what this guy is.

08:01.720 --> 08:06.220
I know from the first part that the current through this other branch is the same whether it's open

08:06.220 --> 08:06.700
or close.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.100
I know that value.

08:08.350 --> 08:14.420
So now I'm able to solve for what the current through that unknown resistances.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.000
Let's go ahead and write that out.

08:16.120 --> 08:22.780
The current through the unknown resistance is simply that current flowing through the battery minus

08:22.780 --> 08:26.110
the current one.

08:26.470 --> 08:30.760
All right you substitute the numbers in the calculator you're eventually going to find that the current

08:30.760 --> 08:37.380
through that unknown resistance is going to be five point five seven.

08:37.970 --> 08:43.370
It's a very small 10 to the minus 4 amps.

08:43.450 --> 08:48.580
So now we have everything we need here are two equations here.

08:48.730 --> 08:56.030
We have a voltage drop across points A and B we know the current flowing through this unknown resistance.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.800
We can now solve for the unknown resistance.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.320
Let's go and maybe do that down here.

09:02.020 --> 09:05.720
So here we have the resistance R is one third.

09:05.770 --> 09:12.730
That's the unknown voltage and one over the current flowing through that resistance.

09:12.730 --> 09:15.110
Substitute the numbers in your calculator.

09:15.130 --> 09:21.130
Now you should get five hundred ninety eight point four homes.

09:21.910 --> 09:23.230
That's our final answer.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.130
So that's our unknown resistance.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.230
And this is kind of how you set up a problem like this.

09:30.240 --> 09:37.980
So again there's no kind of fixed method here you have to introduce the variable r at some point whether

09:37.980 --> 09:40.650
you started with the switch is closed or open.

09:40.650 --> 09:47.410
You'll eventually have to use both cases in order to kind of end up solving this problem.

09:47.430 --> 09:48.870
All right so review that problem.

09:48.870 --> 09:52.800
It's kind of a good one it's kind of a different style of problem where in this case you have to find

09:52.800 --> 09:55.820
the resistance knowing what the currents are.

09:55.930 --> 09:56.200
So.
