00:00.590 --> 00:02.710
Example eight let's find the currents.

00:02.820 --> 00:03.940
So between points.

00:03.970 --> 00:06.840
B We have a 12 volt potential difference.

00:06.840 --> 00:10.460
Find the current in each one of these resistors or start with case over here.

00:10.650 --> 00:15.140
If you have 12 volts across that means you have 12 volts across each one of those resistors right.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.820
Even if these are in parallel.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.940
That's what it means.

00:17.940 --> 00:23.640
So if you have 12 volts across this forum resistor that means you apply Ohm's law to each one of those

00:23.640 --> 00:27.590
you have to get four in the current flowing through that.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.180
That resistor.

00:29.310 --> 00:35.670
So you get the current flowing through this forum resistor has to be three amps automatically should

00:35.670 --> 00:46.080
be able to write this down the current flowing through the three ohm resistor is 12 over 3 4 amps and

00:46.080 --> 00:53.220
the current flowing through the 6 ohm resistor is the potential difference divided by the resistance

00:53.220 --> 01:01.020
which gives me 2 x I could have asked you what is the current flowing through point a major in the current

01:01.020 --> 01:02.310
flowing like this.

01:02.310 --> 01:06.030
Again this is kind of a junction over here and you know you've got current flowing through each one

01:06.030 --> 01:08.020
of those resistors we just calculated.

01:08.190 --> 01:12.820
We have three amps here you've got four amps here you've got two amps here.

01:12.930 --> 01:17.430
All right and you've multiply each one of those values you have to get 12.

01:17.430 --> 01:21.910
That means that the current kind of going into that junction has to be 9 amps.

01:21.930 --> 01:25.280
It also has to be 9 amps leaving the junction.

01:25.410 --> 01:27.730
We need to conserve the charge.

01:28.230 --> 01:31.090
OK so next part case be.

01:31.320 --> 01:35.160
I think the first thing I would probably do is try to simplify this a little bit.

01:35.160 --> 01:40.410
Let's maybe try to simplify the parallel combination over here.

01:40.410 --> 01:45.350
The way I would do that our equivalent one there's only two of them.

01:45.360 --> 01:49.880
I always liked the multiply divided by the sum divided by eight.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.000
You can divide through by four on each term.

01:53.160 --> 01:57.440
You are left with three over 2 ohms.

01:57.930 --> 02:04.140
And now if I combine the three ohms with the three over to the total are equivalent for this or between

02:04.140 --> 02:15.750
points and point B call that are equivalent total is three plus 1.5 is me 4.5 ohms.

02:15.810 --> 02:21.540
Let me just write that as 9 over to help a little bit with the math after I just kind of like to have

02:21.540 --> 02:24.440
things in fractions most of the time.

02:24.480 --> 02:24.750
All right.

02:24.750 --> 02:28.530
So we now we have to find the current was the whole point is simplifying all of this so we know we have

02:28.710 --> 02:31.610
12 volts between points and points B.

02:31.620 --> 02:36.510
So that means that the current now simply going to be 12 divided by the value of the resistance which

02:36.510 --> 02:40.760
is nine over two we can factor out at three.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.630
And at the end we're left with eight over 3 amps.

02:45.630 --> 02:49.350
So that is the value of the current flowing through this equivalent resistance.

02:49.350 --> 02:53.970
But it's also going to be the value of the current flowing through the three ohm resistor so I can automatically

02:53.970 --> 02:54.210
right.

02:54.210 --> 02:57.470
This is the current flowing through the 3 ohm resistor.

02:58.820 --> 03:00.500
Now what happens here is there's a junction.

03:00.500 --> 03:02.850
So part of that current is going to flow here.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.120
Part of that current is going to flow here.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.740
The two old resistor is going to see less.

03:07.850 --> 03:12.140
It's going to see more current rather than the six ohm resistor because it has a smaller value of the

03:12.140 --> 03:18.350
resistance that's where most of the current prefers to go are in order to find how much current flows

03:18.350 --> 03:18.810
here.

03:18.920 --> 03:25.800
Well if we know the voltage drop across each branch we can find it using ohms law again.

03:26.420 --> 03:29.850
But what we can do we could first find what is the voltage across this point

03:33.530 --> 03:39.100
match and we know the voltage drop across is 3 ohm resistor because I know the voltage drop from 8 a

03:39.100 --> 03:39.440
B.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.890
I know that 12.

03:41.330 --> 03:44.080
So it's the voltage drop across the three ohm resistor.

03:44.240 --> 03:47.210
Well it's three multiplied by the current flowing through it.

03:47.210 --> 03:56.090
We just calculated that it has to be 8 volts so you have 12 from a to b.

03:56.110 --> 04:00.090
You have eight right here that means you're left with four.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.900
Two there has to be four volts across both of those resistors they are in parallel with each other.

04:06.130 --> 04:10.930
So each one of them has a four volt drop across it which means you can calculate what the current is

04:10.930 --> 04:11.650
now.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.070
Pretty straightforward.

04:13.210 --> 04:19.120
So the current flowing through the six ohm resistor and the current flowing through the three ohm resistor

04:19.310 --> 04:24.880
adds two ohm resistor Ratta it's going to be the voltage across each one of those we just said it's

04:24.880 --> 04:29.830
4 divided by the value of the resistance in this case it's six.

04:29.830 --> 04:41.830
In this case it's to see you get two amps going down here and you get to over three amps flowing through

04:41.830 --> 04:43.950
the top one.

04:44.230 --> 04:45.600
Now you can check both of that out.

04:45.610 --> 04:46.300
Both of these out.

04:46.300 --> 04:55.000
Now if I add both of those if I add two thirds plus two on that's six thirds I get eight thirds or that's

04:55.000 --> 04:59.680
my junction rle whatever current flows into the junction has to be the current that flows out of the

04:59.680 --> 05:00.610
junction.

05:01.150 --> 05:07.740
And I had a third flowing in I have to have a third flowing out kind of a good problem here.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.350
Hopefully you got that one.
