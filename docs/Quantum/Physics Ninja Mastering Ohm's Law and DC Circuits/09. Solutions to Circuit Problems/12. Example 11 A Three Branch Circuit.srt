WEBVTT

00:00.510 --> 00:05.430
All right here's a three branch circuit this time kind of complicated looking right.

00:05.490 --> 00:07.940
It's got five resistors to batteries.

00:07.940 --> 00:10.730
So again we want to find the current everywhere.

00:10.980 --> 00:16.260
Now I haven't given you any choices here and we also want to find the potential at all these points

00:16.680 --> 00:22.460
given that the potential points see zero volts so that could be the grounding over here.

00:22.470 --> 00:22.750
All right.

00:22.770 --> 00:26.590
So first thing we want to do is we want to pick directions for the currents.

00:26.880 --> 00:33.760
Call this I again it doesn't matter whether you're right or wrong the physics will work its way out.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.980
So I'm going to kind of pick kind of stuff I usually do.

00:37.170 --> 00:46.470
I go on this way I was going down to going to the right through the battery and then maybe two more

00:46.470 --> 00:47.610
down here.

00:47.610 --> 00:49.600
So there's another junction over here.

00:49.890 --> 00:57.080
So some current going up here I three and then maybe some other current going down here I-4.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.780
All right so we've got all these branches here.

00:58.780 --> 01:01.450
We've got five different currents we have to determine.

01:01.890 --> 01:04.540
Let's go ahead and maybe write some junction rules.

01:04.820 --> 01:11.820
If junction at point B if at the current going in has to be equal to the current going out.

01:11.960 --> 01:17.410
So it has to be one plus to call this equation one.

01:17.460 --> 01:23.350
What other ones we have we have another junction down over here said I to do this one at the end.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.950
Two has to be equal to three plus four.

01:28.950 --> 01:29.190
All right.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.250
There's another equation equation too.

01:32.460 --> 01:37.590
One thing I can also do is I can simplify both of these right the three in the six Let me shade that

01:37.590 --> 01:40.820
area a little bit here just so we know we're talking about both of those.

01:40.860 --> 01:46.560
You can simplify it because there's two resistors that are certainly in parallel with each other.

01:46.860 --> 01:52.770
So what you have to do is you simply multiply divided by the sum you multiply and you get 18 18 divided

01:52.770 --> 01:53.250
by nine.

01:53.250 --> 01:56.420
This is equivalent to a 2 ohm resistor.

01:56.430 --> 02:00.010
Actually what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to forget about this entire part for now.

02:00.260 --> 02:07.080
I'm just going to replace everything here by two ohm resistor between point D and point B at the and

02:07.080 --> 02:08.630
I'll come back and solve for this.

02:08.640 --> 02:13.320
But let's just for now just replace it with a 2 ohm and then it looks really really similar to a previous

02:13.320 --> 02:15.120
problem I did.

02:15.120 --> 02:15.340
All right.

02:15.340 --> 02:18.900
Next we want to do now is we don't have enough information and we really need to write down some loop

02:18.900 --> 02:19.550
rules.

02:19.970 --> 02:21.090
So let's go ahead and write those.

02:21.090 --> 02:26.220
I'm going to start at point F and I'm going to go on this interior or this loop here that's on the left

02:26.220 --> 02:27.330
most side.

02:27.750 --> 02:34.140
So the first thing I do is going to be equivalent three going across a battery and I'm crossing a battery

02:34.140 --> 02:36.810
in this direction so I get plus 18 volts.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.250
Now I'm going to get a drop right.

02:38.250 --> 02:44.760
I get a voltage drop across that resistor which is minus 12 multiplied by the current flowing through

02:44.760 --> 02:46.530
it.

02:46.530 --> 02:52.560
Now I'm going to go down the center branch again I'm going to have a voltage drop given by six multiplied

02:52.560 --> 02:53.840
by the current flowing through it.

02:53.850 --> 02:59.240
In this case I won and then I'm going to go back to everywhere where I started to point.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.910
So I get zero for that one.

03:01.950 --> 03:05.830
Now the other thing I can do is I can do a big loop around the entire thing.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.040
So let's do that.

03:07.050 --> 03:12.050
Call this equation for and I'll have enough information at least to get started.

03:12.300 --> 03:16.170
So first thing I have again these first two terms are going to be the same they're exactly the same

03:16.170 --> 03:20.120
as this so it's 18 because I go over the battery across that resistor.

03:20.190 --> 03:28.830
Now I'm at point B and next thing I do now I'm going to cross a three ohm resistor so I get a voltage

03:28.830 --> 03:32.240
drop given by three how careful here is multiplied by different current.

03:32.260 --> 03:41.010
I do all right now at Point C I'm going to go here and I'm going to cross a battery battery and I'm

03:41.010 --> 03:42.910
crossing it from the lower to the higher.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.710
So I get plus 21.

03:45.960 --> 03:48.530
Now on that point Dean I want to get the point.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.610
And instead of introducing kind of two new variables here I'm just going to replace this by an equivalent

03:53.610 --> 03:58.830
resistor and now I'm going to go across it that equivalent resistor which just to say I get a voltage

03:58.830 --> 04:03.750
drop given by two and multiplied by two and that's it.

04:03.750 --> 04:09.840
I go back to where I started and I've done actually these three equations here allow me to solve for

04:09.930 --> 04:16.350
I 1 and 2 because they don't really introduce 3 or 4 because they don't because that kind of simplified

04:16.350 --> 04:18.990
it by using this equivalent resistance.

04:19.050 --> 04:23.580
So now I can proceed and I can actually solve for these three currents here just using equation 1 3

04:23.580 --> 04:27.080
and 4 am going to do it the exact same way I previously did.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.920
So using equation 3 let's call it three prime.

04:29.940 --> 04:36.780
I'm going to start by isolating and by using either one or isolating I one and writing it in terms of

04:36.780 --> 04:37.940
the current.

04:38.340 --> 04:45.240
So if you do that I bring that on the other side I get six times I one has to be equal to 18 minus 12

04:45.630 --> 04:46.790
times I.

04:47.550 --> 04:50.370
So I get that I won.

04:50.410 --> 04:56.340
If I divide through by six I'm going to get three for that one minus two times.

04:57.090 --> 05:01.220
All right so that's my equation 3 pry my equation for prime do a similar thing.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.550
18 plus 21 gives me 39.

05:04.970 --> 05:09.410
And this one three two and two I will give me five.

05:09.470 --> 05:11.270
So I get five Aitu.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.390
I bring that on the other side.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.380
I'll isolate that.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.470
Now I get thirty nine.

05:16.980 --> 05:20.610
And what else do I have I still have the minus 12.

05:21.670 --> 05:22.000
OK.

05:22.040 --> 05:24.470
Now you can isolate what I two is.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.540
Thirty nine is looks like a messy fraction.

05:27.550 --> 05:34.250
Thirty nine over five minus 12 over five multiplied by.

05:35.060 --> 05:40.010
OK so now I have expressions for I want an I'D to and I'm going to go back to Equation 1 and let's substitute

05:40.010 --> 05:41.580
everything and Equation 1.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.380
Let's call this equation 1 prime.

05:44.380 --> 05:58.420
So you get i equals three minus two I Plus thirty nine over five minus 12 over five times.

05:58.930 --> 06:02.080
All right the only unknown in this equation over here is the letter I.

06:02.090 --> 06:03.980
So you just have to group all the terms together.

06:03.980 --> 06:07.180
Bring this on the other side bring this on the other side.

06:07.460 --> 06:15.110
So what do you end up getting in the getting I mean plus two I if I bring it on the other side and plus

06:15.110 --> 06:24.920
12 over five I on this side here I get thirty nine over five plus three.

06:25.850 --> 06:26.370
OK.

06:26.390 --> 06:30.010
Now I'm going to put things on a common denominator of five.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.060
I think that's going to help me.

06:31.100 --> 06:35.190
So this is going to be five over five plus ten over five.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.310
This is still 12.

06:37.680 --> 06:41.540
And on the side too if I put everything on a common denominator of five I think that's going to help

06:41.540 --> 06:42.410
me.

06:42.440 --> 06:43.970
This is still 39.

06:44.420 --> 06:49.560
If I put this over five that means I have to multiply by five.

06:49.570 --> 06:49.820
All right.

06:49.820 --> 06:52.120
Now this simplifies nicely what just about done.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.570
So are about all the algebra but that's life.

06:55.580 --> 07:05.210
All right so what do we get over here we get 15 plus 12 27 and here we get oh 54 Well that's easy.

07:05.540 --> 07:12.690
So I simply going to be 54 divided by 27 and we've seen that before.

07:12.830 --> 07:15.440
There's two imps.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.670
Boy that was a lot of work to get to that answer.

07:17.750 --> 07:20.840
But here we have two aims in this section over here.

07:20.990 --> 07:27.470
Two aims are now part of that Currence going to go down here part of it's going to go over here.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.760
So let's go ahead and look at that.

07:28.760 --> 07:36.230
So look at I won I won we have an expression for Iowa and it's three minus two times.

07:36.230 --> 07:38.850
The letter I wrote two times two.

07:38.870 --> 07:45.670
What happens here if three minus four minus one.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.740
What does that mean is the first time we've seen this in this group.

07:49.790 --> 07:53.150
So remember whenever you end up getting a negative sign.

07:53.270 --> 07:57.520
The only thing it tells me is that my initial guess was wrong.

07:57.560 --> 08:03.740
Instead of having a current flowing down in that branch really what we have is a current flowing up

08:03.740 --> 08:04.770
in that branch.

08:04.940 --> 08:05.820
OK.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.770
So switch the direction.

08:08.140 --> 08:10.500
And now you're going to find that one is actually here.

08:10.520 --> 08:15.290
So it's one app and it's flowing up so that they'll be scared by this.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.550
OK so just be a little bit careful with that one.

08:17.780 --> 08:21.740
I too on the other hand too we have our expression down over here.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.230
This looks like it's a bit of a mess.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.310
But let's try it out.

08:24.530 --> 08:27.820
Thirty nine over five minus.

08:27.830 --> 08:30.240
This will be 24 over five.

08:30.610 --> 08:35.780
Oh that looks like 15 over five which gives me three.

08:35.780 --> 08:35.950
All right.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.090
So does that make sense.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.810
Says this guy here's three.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.170
Here we have one going in.

08:42.170 --> 08:43.490
We have two going in.

08:43.490 --> 08:43.710
Oh yeah.

08:43.710 --> 08:45.640
You have to have three going that way.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.030
Perfect.

08:47.810 --> 08:50.850
All right so now we've got three going into the junction.

08:50.870 --> 08:53.440
Now how do we solve for the two currents down over here.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.570
Three and Four.

08:55.790 --> 08:58.200
Let's go ahead maybe do that over here in the box.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.420
So we've already got one equation that relates both of those.

09:03.590 --> 09:05.230
What else can I do while I can do.

09:05.300 --> 09:09.060
You know that the voltage across each one has to be the same.

09:09.530 --> 09:12.800
Or you can do a little loop rule right around here if you want to.

09:13.070 --> 09:17.220
Let's do that let's go around counter-clockwise around this small loop.

09:17.870 --> 09:23.330
What does that look like well when you cross a resistor like this I get a voltage drop given by three

09:25.010 --> 09:30.740
times three and then I'm going to go cross a six ohm resistor but I'm crossing it in the opposite direction

09:30.740 --> 09:31.660
of the current.

09:31.970 --> 09:37.380
So I get a voltage gain of six times I4 then I go back to where I start.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.870
And I get zero.

09:39.650 --> 09:43.120
Maybe I can simplify this a little bit.

09:43.190 --> 09:44.910
So what would you get used.

09:44.960 --> 09:51.800
Right I three must be equal to two I4 from this equation and then can go ahead and substitute that over

09:51.800 --> 09:53.330
here.

09:53.330 --> 09:53.810
And what do you get.

09:53.810 --> 10:00.060
Because you know what I do is we solved I tune the previous problem we said it was three amps.

10:00.240 --> 10:03.620
So now what do you get I three wants do that.

10:03.620 --> 10:09.710
So you get to I4 plus I4 gives me three.

10:09.710 --> 10:14.960
So what is I forgive you for then must be equal to 1.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.260
And I've got three going in.

10:18.470 --> 10:20.390
I've got one going downstairs.

10:20.390 --> 10:21.560
How many do I have over here.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.560
I have to have two.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.810
This here has to be two minutes and you're going to get that just for manipulating these two equations

10:28.810 --> 10:30.000
a junction rule.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.710
And also my basically my loop rule just rearranged.

10:33.770 --> 10:35.240
You could solve for those two unknowns.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.070
This is what you'll find.

10:38.040 --> 10:38.290
All right.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.400
Pretty good so far.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.840
Now all we have to do is look at all the voltages.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.110
Now we've solved all the currents.

10:44.120 --> 10:50.170
Let's look at all the voltages except they're telling us that this voltage up here is equal to zero.

10:50.930 --> 10:51.830
Well that's pretty easy.

10:51.830 --> 10:52.930
So let's go around now.

10:53.090 --> 10:56.570
Let's go around the loop here and write down all these voltages everywhere.

10:56.600 --> 10:57.620
So if I go to D.

10:57.630 --> 11:03.350
Well that should be 21 volts above point C right.

11:03.350 --> 11:05.870
So VD should be 21 volts

11:09.340 --> 11:10.570
BD.

11:11.350 --> 11:11.780
OK.

11:11.810 --> 11:14.240
Now what else oh how can I get the Wii.

11:14.300 --> 11:19.050
Well there's a couple different paths I can do now right.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.980
How do I get over here across.

11:21.010 --> 11:25.280
I can either go through the three Omaar I can go through the six it doesn't matter which one I do.

11:25.280 --> 11:29.820
Both of these are in parallel there's the same voltage drop across each one.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.360
So let's just go down here through the six.

11:32.420 --> 11:36.440
So I get to get a voltage drop equal to six multiplied by the current going through it.

11:36.440 --> 11:44.030
That's six six volts across this one and I'm at 21 and if I go down six volts that means that the voltage

11:44.030 --> 11:47.810
right over here has to be 15 volts.

11:47.810 --> 11:51.950
How about now if I go to point f Why do I cross any resistors here.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.840
If I don't then there's no voltage drop across anything here.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.910
So that means at this point here should also be at 15 volts.

12:00.730 --> 12:00.970
All right.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.640
How do I work my way today.

12:02.660 --> 12:09.380
Well if I work my way to a I get 15 here and then what do I do I gain how many I gain 18.

12:09.710 --> 12:15.720
So that means that the voltage over here up Point A has to be 15 plus 18.

12:15.790 --> 12:18.910
It gives me 33.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.720
All right what else can I do on how I can go through the 12 ohm resistor right.

12:22.820 --> 12:26.730
If I go through the 12 Omers this there are a lot of different ways to get to be.

12:26.840 --> 12:32.310
I can either go over here I can go from E to be I can go from C to be it doesn't matter.

12:32.390 --> 12:37.550
Actually it's pretty easy even just to go from C to be because you know there's a voltage drop here

12:37.550 --> 12:43.130
and the voltage drop across this three ohm resistor is the value of the resistance multiplied by the

12:43.130 --> 12:44.570
current.

12:44.660 --> 12:46.330
So that gives me nine.

12:46.970 --> 12:53.450
So that means that this point here should be at 9 volts because I know that I have to drop down 9 volts

12:53.450 --> 12:55.580
if I'm going to be at zero over here.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.360
Point C.

12:57.680 --> 12:57.940
All right.

12:57.950 --> 13:01.730
So actually determining the voltages around it's pretty straightforward especially if they give you

13:01.730 --> 13:02.880
a starting point.

13:03.080 --> 13:07.790
Once you know the currents and you know the values of everything the voltages of the batteries you know

13:07.790 --> 13:09.730
the values of currents everywhere.

13:10.010 --> 13:14.540
You know the resistor is everywhere or you can easily calculate what the voltage gains are the drops

13:14.540 --> 13:16.620
are at every point in the circuit.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.710
So it's pretty easy to fill out the rest of the blanks.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.500
Hopefully you understand this by now.

13:21.590 --> 13:24.160
This should be starting to get a little bit easier for you.
