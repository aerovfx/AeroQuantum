00:00.130 --> 00:07.140
Are problem 27 circuits connected to a 9 volt battery with a net resistance of forty point five ohms.

00:07.140 --> 00:12.960
How much energy is being dissipated by the circuit in a time interval of one minute.

00:12.960 --> 00:13.440
All right.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.100
And be careful.

00:14.100 --> 00:17.220
This is energy in one minute.

00:17.220 --> 00:21.410
All right we basically just have a simple circuit with one battery.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.020
Basically one resistor we know this is Nine volts.

00:26.020 --> 00:29.790
We know our is forty point five.

00:30.220 --> 00:36.940
We can easily calculate the power right the power being dissipated by that resistance is simply V squared

00:37.510 --> 00:38.920
divided by our.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.600
So we get 81.

00:40.630 --> 00:44.830
That's our 9 squared divided by forty point five.

00:44.830 --> 00:45.320
All right.

00:45.490 --> 00:46.360
Now remember what this is.

00:46.360 --> 00:48.210
This is measured in Watts.

00:48.210 --> 00:51.510
That's the rate at which energy is being dissipated.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.980
Now we're given a certain time.

00:52.990 --> 00:54.750
So really this is energy

00:57.840 --> 01:01.050
per unit time per delta-T.

01:01.380 --> 01:05.520
So at the end all we're looking for here is really this guy the energy.

01:05.520 --> 01:07.910
So we need to bring the Delta team on the other side.

01:08.280 --> 01:15.700
So the total energy dissipated in one minute is call it e is going to be equal to my power multiplied

01:15.750 --> 01:18.440
by the time interval.

01:18.790 --> 01:25.750
So the power we just said was 81 divided by forty point five multiply by my time interval now.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.070
Careful you don't put in one minute.

01:27.070 --> 01:30.360
Remember this is in Watts's in Joule per second.

01:30.550 --> 01:34.390
So we need to multiply by 60 seconds in order to get the right units.

01:34.390 --> 01:37.940
We want to get our answer to be measured in joules at the end.

01:37.940 --> 01:40.510
All right put that in the calculator punch it in.

01:40.690 --> 01:42.740
You get 120 joules of energy.

01:42.820 --> 01:52.730
So a correct answer for that one choice a problem 28 a resistor has a value of 1 times 10 to the 6 ohms.

01:52.930 --> 02:00.190
The capacitor is one Daniel Feraud connected in series to a battery and the switch asks What is the

02:00.190 --> 02:01.410
time constant.

02:01.630 --> 02:05.180
Well this is just the definition right the time constant.

02:05.220 --> 02:12.360
You gave it defined as the letter tau and for a simple series circuit like this the time constant is

02:12.370 --> 02:16.930
simply the resistance multiplied by the capacitance.

02:16.930 --> 02:25.090
So in this case we simply get 1 times 10 of the six ohms multiplied by a 1 nano Feraud Nano is 10 of

02:25.090 --> 02:27.140
the minus nine.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.440
So carry that out.

02:28.450 --> 02:32.010
You're left with one times ten to the minus three.

02:32.020 --> 02:34.780
And again that is measured in seconds.

02:35.350 --> 02:39.060
OK so one time 10 of the minus three looks like toys B to me.

02:39.090 --> 02:41.260
All I have the one there but you really don't need the one.
