I probably 25 which of the following is true both the current through this resistor up here and the

00:05.700 --> 00:07.110
charge on the capacitor.

00:07.110 --> 00:10.220
Immediately after you close the switch.

00:10.230 --> 00:15.180
All right so this is really in the short time limit because right after you close the switch that's

00:15.180 --> 00:16.080
the key.

00:16.470 --> 00:18.090
And if you remember what happens.

00:18.090 --> 00:20.870
Well initially the charge is zero right.

00:20.940 --> 00:25.950
Typically these are on charge unless they would have told you remember what happened to the charger

00:25.950 --> 00:35.990
as a function of time on a capacitor or the charge starts at zero and it eventually reaches some limit.

00:35.990 --> 00:36.310
All right.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.490
So initially the charge is zero.

00:38.780 --> 00:40.230
So that was pretty easy.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.640
So the charge is zero we can get rid of a whole bunch of some of these cases here and get rid of that

00:43.640 --> 00:45.200
one if not maximum.

00:45.380 --> 00:47.070
It's going to change the whole point of it.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.830
So we only have two choices that are zero.

00:48.830 --> 00:50.400
So let's get rid of this.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.710
Let's also get rid of this.

00:51.710 --> 00:53.010
Get rid of this.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.660
So now we either have the current IDE that is maximum or the current is zero.

00:57.890 --> 01:05.240
Well remember what the current is by definition the current is the rate of change of the charge with

01:05.240 --> 01:11.550
respect to time it's equal to the slope of Q versus T.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.580
And what does the slope look like right here at short time.

01:14.660 --> 01:15.780
Well that's slow.

01:16.070 --> 01:18.080
It's pretty steep.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.780
That's what the current is.

01:20.820 --> 01:23.100
So we actually have a maximum current.

01:23.130 --> 01:28.340
So the correct answer for this one has to be Choi's be maximum current.

01:28.350 --> 01:33.380
Remember what you do in the short time limit actually is you basically to short out the capacitor.

01:33.510 --> 01:35.710
So you imagine that it's just the wire.

01:35.790 --> 01:40.110
So if it's just the wire and I close the switch I basically just have this battery and a resistor.

01:40.110 --> 01:43.140
So there's going to be a large current of it after a while.

01:43.140 --> 01:49.380
Now once you start accumulating charge and it's not just a wire anymore you start building up a voltage

01:49.380 --> 01:50.430
here.

01:51.530 --> 01:54.340
So the whole process kind of slows down.

01:54.410 --> 01:54.660
All right.

01:54.670 --> 01:58.460
But this is one that should be pretty straightforward for you given all the discussion we had in the

01:58.460 --> 02:00.980
lecture notes.

02:00.980 --> 02:06.320
All right well if we asked you a little bit about the short time limit her also going to ask you about

02:06.320 --> 02:11.600
the long time limit that's question 26 question 26 which are the following is true about the current

02:11.600 --> 02:18.160
through this resistor in the charge in the capacitor when the switch is closed for a long time.

02:18.220 --> 02:23.860
Well if it's close for a long time we know what happens after a while there is no more current right

02:24.340 --> 02:33.170
the current eventually goes to zero and the current goes to zero is not a maximum maximum.

02:33.560 --> 02:38.050
So we're left with basically two choices what happens to the charge.

02:38.050 --> 02:40.720
It's either zero or it's a maximum value.

02:40.910 --> 02:45.490
Well again what I just plotted on the previous case was that the charge goes up until it reaches some

02:45.500 --> 02:46.550
saturation limit

02:49.580 --> 02:52.740
that was charge as a function of time.

02:53.090 --> 02:58.570
And you could see that the slope of that curve over here which is over here this is the long time limit.

02:58.730 --> 03:06.010
The slope is the current and that slope is flat so that zero in the charge reaches some maximum value.

03:06.200 --> 03:10.210
So we have ZERO current maximum charge correct answer here should be choice.

03:10.250 --> 03:10.670
