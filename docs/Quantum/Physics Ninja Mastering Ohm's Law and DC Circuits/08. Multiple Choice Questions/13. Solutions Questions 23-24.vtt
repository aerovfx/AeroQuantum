00:00.150 --> 00:01.930
All right here's problem 23.

00:02.100 --> 00:06.300
It's the same surgery as before so rather than kind of redoing everything.

00:06.300 --> 00:11.680
I'm just going to remember that I have two amps kind of flowing over here two amps.

00:11.900 --> 00:12.420
OK.

00:12.840 --> 00:17.780
So now they want to know what is the potential difference across the tool resistor.

00:18.270 --> 00:25.190
Well let's imagine now if you connected a volt meter right across here what would be the measurement

00:26.930 --> 00:32.880
that's simply given by Ohm's law you know the value of the resistance is to voltage across any resistor

00:32.910 --> 00:37.830
is the value of the resistance multiplied by how much current is flowing through it.

00:37.880 --> 00:41.300
In this case it's 2 ohms multiplied by two amps.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.580
You should measure four volts.

00:43.590 --> 00:51.440
Correct answer is C doesn't it any easier than that our problem 24.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.310
What is the power dissipated appear through this resistor much power is dissipated.

00:56.460 --> 01:01.110
So power dissipated that you need to know the voltage across that resistor and you need to know how

01:01.110 --> 01:01.740
much current.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.540
We don't know any of those.

01:03.840 --> 01:04.860
Right.

01:04.920 --> 01:08.350
What else we can rewrite this equation is our eyes squared.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.980
Well that's pretty good.

01:09.980 --> 01:14.670
If we knew the current flowing through this resistor we know the value of r is 6 we can calculate how

01:14.670 --> 01:16.830
much power is being dissipated.

01:16.830 --> 01:18.000
So how do we get the current.

01:18.010 --> 01:20.220
Well a lot of different ways to do that.

01:20.260 --> 01:25.710
Again it's the same circuit as the previous two problems so we've already found that we have two amps

01:26.460 --> 01:30.900
kind of going into the junction and that's not necessarily to going up here right cause some of that

01:30.900 --> 01:32.880
current is going to be split.

01:32.880 --> 01:37.500
So what we're going to do here is I'm going to call the current over here I want and I'm going to call

01:37.500 --> 01:40.440
the current in the bottom branch too.

01:41.610 --> 01:48.000
And we know there's two amps going in that's going to be the current is two going in.

01:48.400 --> 01:48.910
OK.

01:49.110 --> 01:59.160
So the junction rule up there simply says that two must be equal to I one plus i'd two.

01:59.190 --> 02:00.410
All right I need something else.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.110
I don't have enough information yet.

02:02.270 --> 02:06.900
Now the other thing I know is that whatever the voltage is across this branch has to be the same voltage

02:06.900 --> 02:10.270
across that branch because they are in parallel with each other.

02:10.410 --> 02:16.330
So the voltage across the six ohm resistor is six multiplied by one.

02:16.490 --> 02:20.980
That must be equal to 12 multiplied by two.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.160
All right.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.020
Now we have two equations in two unknowns.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.060
What we can do here is simplify.

02:27.060 --> 02:34.980
You can write that to simply going to be one half of one.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.420
Now go ahead and substitute that into this equation.

02:38.420 --> 02:45.490
When you're left with two equals to I one plus one half of 1.

02:46.170 --> 02:50.230
You can sum both of those three halfs.

02:50.700 --> 02:50.900
All right.

02:50.910 --> 02:55.980
It's at the end we're left with the current I want that's the current flowing through the 6 ohm resistor.

02:56.070 --> 03:04.050
Bring the two over here of the four divided by three four thirds.

03:04.110 --> 03:06.250
Now what I've done we want to know the power.

03:06.690 --> 03:08.570
So let's go back to our power equation.

03:08.810 --> 03:10.310
Just kind of do it over here.

03:10.470 --> 03:16.710
So the power dissipated in there is this there is the value of the resistance which is six multiplied

03:16.710 --> 03:22.880
by the current flowing through it which is four thirds.

03:22.950 --> 03:23.300
All right.

03:23.310 --> 03:27.320
So at the end we're left with six multiplied by 16 divided by nine.

03:27.330 --> 03:29.550
I'm not going to try to do that in my head.

03:29.550 --> 03:35.490
You substitute that in your calculator you should get ten point seven watts correct answer for this

03:35.490 --> 03:36.530
one choice.

03:36.540 --> 03:43.650
A few extra steps here because we needed to find what the current was flowing through the 6 ohm resistor.
