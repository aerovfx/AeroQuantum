00:00.150 --> 00:05.220
All right for problem 7 we have an electric current of one eyup flows through a circuit the part of

00:05.220 --> 00:10.160
the circuit contains a 12 volt battery with an internal resistance of two ohms.

00:10.320 --> 00:16.470
What is the volt meter reading so you apply a volt meter and you connected to this side and that side

00:16.470 --> 00:18.650
of the terminals of the battery.

00:18.870 --> 00:23.600
So if you call this point A and Point B what would you actually measure was the voltage.

00:23.720 --> 00:30.840
VB mine is effectively for this one you're basically just going to start at point 8 we're going to move

00:30.840 --> 00:34.950
across point B we're going across a resistor across a battery.

00:34.980 --> 00:41.250
So the way you do this now is if I start out Point am at some potential vitÃ¦ and now I'm going to a

00:41.250 --> 00:43.050
resistor in the direction of the current.

00:43.050 --> 00:45.280
I know there's one amp going through here.

00:45.500 --> 00:50.740
So mine has to multiply by one that's the voltage drop across that internal resistance.

00:50.900 --> 00:55.520
And now I'm going to gain 12 volts and then I eventually get to Point B.

00:55.570 --> 01:00.470
So it just re-arranges this is minus to plus 12 gives me 10.

01:00.930 --> 01:01.620
So VB.

01:01.620 --> 01:06.040
Mine is V.A simply equal to 10 volts.

01:06.500 --> 01:13.140
OK so you get a little bit less than what the ideal MF is of that battery.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.340
OK so 10 volts see is the correct answer for this one for problem.

01:18.360 --> 01:24.210
Kind of a similar setup different battery different direction of the battery also different internal

01:24.210 --> 01:25.910
resistance different current.

01:25.920 --> 01:31.350
So now we have electric current of two amps flows through a circuit part of the battery six volt internal

01:31.350 --> 01:32.730
resistance is point five.

01:32.730 --> 01:34.590
What does the volt meter read.

01:34.710 --> 01:39.250
I notice in this case all the answers are positive numbers.

01:39.570 --> 01:43.250
So again we're going to proceed to using the same method it worked for the last problem probably worked

01:43.260 --> 01:43.950
for this one.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.170
All right.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.760
Define those two points.

01:47.790 --> 01:50.790
And now we simply start at point a move toward Point B.

01:51.020 --> 01:55.310
So we have V.A now we're going across a resistor We're going across a resistor in the direction of the

01:55.310 --> 01:55.980
current.

01:56.240 --> 02:02.880
So we get a voltage drop given by two multiplied by 0.5 value of the resistance.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.520
And now we're going across a battery set.

02:05.590 --> 02:10.890
Looking now we're going from the high to the low potential so therefore we get a voltage drop given

02:10.890 --> 02:18.260
by 6 volts and then we end up going to point B V.A is what.

02:18.260 --> 02:22.040
So this here is minus one and minus 6.

02:22.060 --> 02:24.390
Gives me VB.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.930
All right in this case we have V-A.

02:26.930 --> 02:30.860
Mine is VB equal to 7.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.980
If you did it the other way around if you got VB.

02:32.990 --> 02:38.010
Mine is V.A you get minus 7.

02:38.230 --> 02:43.220
Again here they're really just talking about a magnitude of the Volt volt meter reading.

02:43.540 --> 02:46.610
So the correct answer for this one would be a no negative answer.

02:46.610 --> 02:51.270
So there's not really a technically it would you'd have to kind of define which side is which.

02:51.280 --> 02:55.460
But you'd get Plus-X plus seven or minus seven depending on how you hook it up.
