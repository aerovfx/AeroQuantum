00:00.390 --> 00:01.730
All right here's Question 11.

00:01.740 --> 00:08.310
We have five electric circuits are connected to the same battery with negligible resistance which current

00:08.310 --> 00:11.390
has the least current through the battery.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.630
All right so the one that's going to have the least amount of current.

00:14.710 --> 00:20.550
Again if the batteries are all the same it means that the voltage across each resistance or equivalent

00:20.550 --> 00:23.210
resistance has to be the same.

00:23.220 --> 00:28.380
So now if we think about this equation for a minute in which one is going to have the current that's

00:28.380 --> 00:35.930
going to be small as if the voltage is the same it's whichever one has the biggest equivalent resistance.

00:35.970 --> 00:38.840
So what's the equivalent resistance for each case.

00:38.850 --> 00:44.220
Well for both of those you multiply the million divided by the sum you're going to get for here if you

00:44.220 --> 00:47.220
multiply them divided by the sum you're going to get three.

00:47.290 --> 00:49.000
36 divided by 12.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.580
Here you simply add them up.

00:50.610 --> 00:54.180
You're going to get six here you automatically get nine.

00:54.180 --> 01:00.440
And here you're going to get four is the equivalent resistance for the two tuum resistors in series.

01:00.450 --> 01:06.670
So what do we have the least amount of current is going to be the one with the highest equivalent resistance.

01:06.900 --> 01:11.820
That's 9 ohms so is the correct answer for question 11.

01:11.860 --> 01:18.340
All right for a question 12 are asked five different electric circuits are connected to the same battery

01:18.520 --> 01:20.110
with negligible resistance.

01:20.110 --> 01:23.660
Which circuit produces the greatest power dissipated.

01:24.010 --> 01:30.280
Well now if we think about our power equations we kind of had three we had Vi you can write this as

01:30.280 --> 01:31.840
our eyes squared.

01:32.230 --> 01:37.930
And the third form was v squared over are you know why I like about the third form for this problem

01:37.930 --> 01:41.790
is because we know the batteries the same right.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.530
It's the same battery for each case.

01:43.530 --> 01:47.460
That means that the voltage across these networks are going to be the same.

01:47.500 --> 01:52.420
So if we want to know now the greatest power the going to be the one with the smallest resistance because

01:52.580 --> 01:55.360
you're going to be dividing by that small number.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.940
So which one has the smallest resistance.

01:57.940 --> 02:04.210
We just did these three these five different cases and we found at this one here had three homes was

02:04.210 --> 02:08.500
the equivalent resistance and that's the smallest out of all of these.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.630
Same problem that we just solved.

02:10.990 --> 02:13.960
OK so it definitely has to be choice B is the correct answer.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.950
It has the smallest resistance the voltage across all the networks are the same.
