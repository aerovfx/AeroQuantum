00:00.230 --> 00:01.170
All right here's a problem.

00:01.180 --> 00:07.710
Fifteen two resistors with resistances three home and two OAM are connected in series with a 12 volt

00:07.710 --> 00:08.590
battery.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.830
The current in the circuit is two apes.

00:12.030 --> 00:15.630
What is the internal resistance down although they don't really show you the internal resistance.

00:15.630 --> 00:20.450
You can always kind of assume that there is one especially if the questions asking you that to calculate

00:20.450 --> 00:22.410
what the internal resistance is.

00:22.410 --> 00:26.640
So first thing we're going to do well let's do a loop rule around here.

00:26.640 --> 00:29.740
Right if we do a loop rule around here we know there's two amps.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.730
So right away we're going to first see there's going to be a voltage drop across this internal resistance.

00:35.730 --> 00:37.770
Let me just call it lower case r.

00:38.100 --> 00:43.920
So we get minus two multiply by little are now going across the battery I'm going to get a 12 volt battery

00:44.700 --> 00:50.610
and then I'm going to just combine the three and the two over here again is going to be a voltage drop

00:50.670 --> 00:55.870
given by five multiplied by the current the current flowing through it is two.

00:56.330 --> 00:56.790
OK.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.960
And that there has to be equal to zero.

00:59.310 --> 01:00.930
So let's simplify this a little bit.

01:00.970 --> 01:08.250
So this becomes 12 that is 10 and minus two times are has to be equal to zero.

01:08.250 --> 01:08.520
All right.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.750
So we get two must be equal to two times.

01:11.780 --> 01:16.150
R R should be equal to one point zero ohms.

01:16.410 --> 01:24.930
Correct answer for this one is choice a ok problem 16 is similar you have two resistors this time in

01:24.930 --> 01:29.910
parallel 30 and 60 ohm they're connected to a 6 volt battery.

01:29.940 --> 01:33.860
They tell us the current is flowing through the battery here 0.25 amps.

01:33.950 --> 01:35.960
What's the internal resistance.

01:35.970 --> 01:40.680
Again it doesn't look like there's one in the drawing but you just put one in there right next to the

01:40.680 --> 01:42.520
battery it's in series with the battery.

01:42.630 --> 01:48.420
OK so one day I would probably do to begin with here is probably to combine both of these into one equivalent

01:48.420 --> 01:51.280
resistance since there's only two.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.660
It's very easy the equivalent resistance if they're in parallel.

01:54.660 --> 02:02.510
You just multiply them and divided by the sum so you get 180 over 9.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.730
Should give me 20 ohms.

02:05.380 --> 02:05.900
OK.

02:06.210 --> 02:11.160
So now I could start at one corner and do a complete loop around.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.770
So and do a loop rule that's it.

02:13.980 --> 02:19.710
So first thing I'm going to get a voltage drop across this internal resistance that's given by the current

02:20.340 --> 02:27.380
0.25 multiplied by the value of the unknown internal resistance plus 6 volts.

02:27.390 --> 02:33.290
And then I get another voltage drop across this eq. 20 ohm resistor and the current is still zero point

02:33.290 --> 02:34.770
twenty five.

02:34.770 --> 02:38.980
Now that's multiplied by 20 and that's equal to zero.

02:39.350 --> 02:40.950
OK you just have to do a little bit of math.

02:40.950 --> 02:43.770
Let me bring this term on the other side.

02:43.880 --> 02:49.760
So you get 0.25 are going to be equal to 6 minus.

02:50.010 --> 02:54.410
This is one over four multiplied by 20.

02:54.420 --> 03:00.220
Should Give me five OK six minus five gives me one.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.110
So ours should be equal to four.

03:03.110 --> 03:03.870
All right.

03:03.910 --> 03:07.640
One divided by 0.25 gives me forums.

03:07.780 --> 03:09.700
So at the end I should get a choice.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.600
DS The correct answer for a problem 16.

03:13.240 --> 03:13.630
OK.

03:13.630 --> 03:19.060
Kind of the same procedure as the previous one just resistors in parallel.

03:19.060 --> 03:19.840
Pretty straightforward.
