Eye problems and problem nine and 10 here for nine we have a wire contains a steady state current of

00:06.630 --> 00:13.340
two amps the number of electrons that pass a cross-section in two seconds is what.

00:13.350 --> 00:16.640
So again you imagine you have just a segment of the wire here.

00:18.780 --> 00:24.870
And if you kind of just slice it and you would count all the electrons so again if we have a current

00:24.870 --> 00:30.120
kind of going through it current I go on like this Well you know electrons are going in the opposite

00:30.120 --> 00:35.640
direction to draw some of those and they're moving in this direction by how many electrons What is the

00:35.640 --> 00:37.150
number that you would get.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.980
Well so again we're going to start with our definition of the current.

00:41.220 --> 00:50.460
We know that equals to two and we know that this current is by definition it's the charge divided by

00:50.460 --> 00:52.450
the time.

00:52.860 --> 00:58.440
So the amount of charge now that's going to go by in two seconds it's going to be two which is the current

00:58.880 --> 01:01.580
multiplied by the amount of time which is two.

01:01.630 --> 01:06.410
So we're actually going to get four cool ohms of charge that's the total charge that's going to go by.

01:06.630 --> 01:12.840
Well that's a lot of charge because if you remember each electron has a charge of 1.6 times tend to

01:12.840 --> 01:19.930
the negative 19 Coolum that's really per electron.

01:20.250 --> 01:25.250
Or let me just write it like this per electron.

01:25.300 --> 01:25.570
All right.

01:25.570 --> 01:28.560
So the way now you get the total number of electrons.

01:28.690 --> 01:36.730
Well again this here has to be this for Coolum must be equal to a number and multiplied by the charge

01:36.730 --> 01:39.710
of each electron.

01:39.850 --> 01:44.590
So all we have to do then to get our number and the number of electrons that goes take are four and

01:44.590 --> 01:53.120
divide it by 1.6 times tend to the negative 19 and at the end what we're going be left with is you should

01:53.120 --> 01:56.070
get 2.5 times 10 of the 19.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.590
So it should be a big number actually.

01:57.650 --> 01:58.480
Get rid of those.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.380
Those don't make any sense.

02:00.740 --> 02:02.610
And then they get the right answer.

02:02.630 --> 02:04.620
Use the calculator in order to get that.

02:05.080 --> 02:05.780
OK.

02:05.990 --> 02:12.710
For problem 10 now is a certain resistor dissipates 0.5 Watts when it's connected to the 3PL potential

02:12.710 --> 02:16.370
difference one connected to a 1 volt potential difference.

02:16.370 --> 02:21.080
The resistor is going to dissipate what let's just draw a little circuit here just for this kind of

02:21.080 --> 02:21.790
a simple problem.

02:21.800 --> 02:27.200
But you know sometimes if you're stuck just drawing a little bit of a diagram some times will help.

02:27.320 --> 02:34.370
So we have a resistance and we have our three volt in case one in case two we're going to use the same

02:34.370 --> 02:35.650
resistance.

02:35.660 --> 02:36.130
All right.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.020
Except we're swapping out the battery.

02:39.020 --> 02:43.920
We're going to use a 1 volt battery this time but the resistance is going to be the same.

02:43.940 --> 02:49.600
So automatically you should know that the current is going to be the different in each case.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.710
And if you want to know the power dissipated again we had three ways to calculate the power since the

02:54.710 --> 02:56.550
resistance is not changing.

02:56.570 --> 03:02.870
I would probably suggest just writing a power Beezus form for the power dissipated through this resistor

03:02.870 --> 03:04.850
is going to be something like this.

03:04.900 --> 03:11.630
So for Case Number one what you can do here is you could calculate what the value of the resistance

03:11.630 --> 03:15.270
is right away because you know the power dissipated.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.530
You know it's a 3 volt potential difference.

03:18.590 --> 03:24.560
So the resistance simply going to be v squared divided by P..

03:25.040 --> 03:32.020
So for this guy here the value of the resistance V squared gives me nine and divided by 0.5.

03:32.030 --> 03:34.400
That should give me 18 ohms.

03:35.330 --> 03:36.620
OK so now what do I have to do.

03:36.630 --> 03:40.600
Now I just basically just work backwards right.

03:40.700 --> 03:44.390
Because we want to know how much power is going to be dissipated in this case.

03:44.390 --> 03:51.050
Now we know the value of the resistance is the same equation V squared over our V in this case is 1

03:51.440 --> 03:55.560
squared it's still 1 and divided by 18.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.460
And this will give you a number in Watts.

03:57.480 --> 04:04.410
I put that in the calculator you should get choice D has the correct answer for that OK.

04:04.940 --> 04:05.990
So that's how you solve that one.
