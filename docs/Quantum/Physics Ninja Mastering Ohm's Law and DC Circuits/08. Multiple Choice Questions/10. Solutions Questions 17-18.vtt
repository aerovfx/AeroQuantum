A problem 17 which are the following graph represents the current as a function of the resistance current

00:06.600 --> 00:07.870
as a function of the resistance.

00:07.860 --> 00:10.420
Well this kind of smells like Ohm's law.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.570
I mean I remember Ohm's law says V equals to our.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.520
Now you've got to be careful here.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.090
They're not tolerable voltage.

00:18.120 --> 00:21.430
They want current as a function of resistance.

00:21.450 --> 00:27.010
So really what you should do is just isolate current if you divide through by the resistance over there.

00:27.020 --> 00:27.560
All right.

00:27.570 --> 00:31.570
So this is really the function that we want to know what it looks like.

00:31.980 --> 00:37.110
Well this one you should know what the shape looks like as you make the resistance big.

00:37.120 --> 00:44.220
Look what happens is the current needs to get smaller not constant get rid of that on the current certainly

00:44.220 --> 00:47.790
not getting bigger and current certainly not getting bigger.

00:47.790 --> 00:54.460
So you're either left with a choice C or toys D and you should realize that this is a an inverse relationship.

00:56.020 --> 01:04.300
So the correct answer for this one is choice D and that's at all our ears Question 18 now one resistor

01:04.300 --> 01:09.060
has a resistance are one and another resistance has a resistance are two.

01:09.220 --> 01:12.010
The resistors are connected in parallel.

01:12.520 --> 01:18.640
And if our one is way bigger than our two the equivalent resistance of the combination is what.

01:18.670 --> 01:18.990
All right.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.370
So again remember what we are going to have here.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.010
We have a parallel circuit.

01:25.110 --> 01:34.310
We have one there of another resistor here that's it let's call this one one let's call this one are

01:34.320 --> 01:35.240
two.

01:35.760 --> 01:42.000
OK we're really looking for what is the equivalent resistance now between point A and Point B.

01:42.080 --> 01:50.250
If you remember the equation now into one over our equivalent equals to 1 over our one plus one over

01:50.250 --> 01:51.400
our two.

01:51.990 --> 01:53.700
So what happens to both of these terms.

01:53.700 --> 01:57.050
Well if our one here is way bigger than our two.

01:57.630 --> 02:03.250
What happens to this first term one over our one our one is a really really big Imagine 10 million ohms

02:03.810 --> 02:05.970
this term here is going to be almost zero.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.770
So forget about it.

02:07.770 --> 02:16.140
So what are we left with we're left with our equivalent is then approximately equal to the resistance

02:16.140 --> 02:16.960
R2.

02:17.070 --> 02:20.970
And that's what's going to happen right you can imagine even if you kind of split this wire over here

02:20.970 --> 02:24.550
that would produce our one which would be basically infinite.

02:24.990 --> 02:29.430
In that case the total resistance between both of those is simply going to be the resistance are to

02:30.420 --> 02:34.950
the current not going to go where there is this very very large resistance or very little current is

02:34.950 --> 02:35.740
going to go there.

02:35.910 --> 02:38.750
Most of the current is going to flow here.

02:39.150 --> 02:42.390
So for this one here the correct answer is Choice B.
