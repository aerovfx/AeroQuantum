00:00.210 --> 00:04.500
All right in order to measure the current and voltage through a circuit how must an ammeter in a volt

00:04.500 --> 00:06.130
meter be connected.

00:06.180 --> 00:14.320
You can just picture a simple circuit with a DC power supply and you imagine just one resistor here.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.270
OK.

00:17.380 --> 00:24.820
And the way this is always done is you always have an ammeter measures current and you want current

00:24.820 --> 00:33.230
to flow through the meter and the voltage is always kind of between for example two points for example

00:33.230 --> 00:35.140
across this resistor.

00:35.140 --> 00:41.190
You always want to put that volt meter here in parallel with what you're measuring.

00:41.800 --> 00:47.880
OK so the ammeter should not be in peril or should be in series and the volt meter here.

00:47.980 --> 00:52.090
So it can't be any of those choices because the ammeters wrong.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.760
So you're left in the volt meter must be in parallel.

00:54.760 --> 00:58.350
So the volt meter can't be in series given that choice.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.490
So really choice D is the best answer here.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.900
This is kind of what it looks like.

01:04.240 --> 01:08.560
You always want the current to flow through the ammeter and you're always measuring the potential difference

01:08.560 --> 01:18.410
between those points should always be and in parallel are problem 30 a battery with internal resistance.

01:18.570 --> 01:24.390
Are electromotive force supplies a current eye to a light bulb of resistance.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.760
Are the power dissipated by this circuit is what I want.

01:28.780 --> 01:30.610
This is just a simple circuit.

01:30.610 --> 01:34.160
You have an internal resistance.

01:34.500 --> 01:36.690
And now we're going to have a light bulb on this side.

01:40.220 --> 01:40.470
All right.

01:40.490 --> 01:47.120
So here's my electromotive force the internal resistance is UPPER CASE our light bulb is lowercase r

01:47.930 --> 01:52.180
this is basically just a simple series circuit.

01:52.430 --> 01:56.110
So if you want to know the power dissipated Well what's the total resistance right.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.420
Both resistors dissipate power.

01:58.790 --> 02:06.600
So the total equivalent resistor you simply are plus lowercase r.

02:06.630 --> 02:15.950
Now if you want to know the power dissipated Well again you know the power supplied is multiplied by

02:15.950 --> 02:19.890
the current and that has to be equal to the total power dissipated.

02:20.150 --> 02:23.040
So what is the current flowing through here.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.860
Leave this one the way it is the current flowing through it that's just given by Ohm's law.

02:26.960 --> 02:27.620
Right.

02:27.620 --> 02:35.920
The current is going to be given by the voltage divided by the total resistance which is our Plus our.

02:35.930 --> 02:41.800
So at the end of the day we get e squared divided by the total equivalent resistance.

02:41.810 --> 02:46.950
That's how much power is being dissipated in the circuit and that's it.

02:47.420 --> 02:53.140
So we've got the light bulb that's dissipating power and we also have the internal resistance that that

02:53.300 --> 02:54.930
is dissipating power.
