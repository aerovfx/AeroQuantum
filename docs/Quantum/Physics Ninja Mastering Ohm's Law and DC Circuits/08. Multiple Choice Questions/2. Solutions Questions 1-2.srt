00:00.150 --> 00:02.460
All right let's tackle some of these multiple choice questions.

00:02.460 --> 00:10.320
First question says a 60 watt bulb operating on a 120 volt household circuit has a resistance closest

00:10.320 --> 00:20.450
to what will 60 watt tells me the power at 60 and voltage is 120.

00:20.610 --> 00:22.980
Now even though it's a C that's not a really big concern.

00:22.980 --> 00:27.240
We can still use what we know again or ask to solve for the resistance.

00:27.510 --> 00:32.160
Well one thing you could do is you could just calculate what the current is and once you know the current

00:32.160 --> 00:36.550
then you can go through and use Ohm's law and calculate with the resistance.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.480
Or you could just write it right from the first step.

00:39.490 --> 00:42.450
You know that the power equation we wrote three different ways.

00:42.530 --> 00:44.860
One way it was written like this.

00:44.860 --> 00:50.280
All right this was the power dissipated Imay resistance R if it had a voltage across it equal to some

00:50.280 --> 00:51.270
value.

00:51.270 --> 00:57.480
So here we just rearrange this equation isolate our So you get v squared over the.

00:57.600 --> 01:01.010
And now we simply substitute This is 120 squared.

01:01.260 --> 01:06.750
Well that's 120 multiplied by 120 and divided by 60.

01:06.760 --> 01:07.020
All right.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.910
Now we can simplify.

01:08.910 --> 01:10.440
Cut out one of the zeros.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.650
The 12 or the six.

01:11.650 --> 01:12.860
You left with the two.

01:13.320 --> 01:17.040
And at the end two multiplied with the 120.

01:17.490 --> 01:19.950
Well let's try that again.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.630
240 and 240 ohms.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.930
Therefore C is the correct answer for this one.

01:27.930 --> 01:28.220
All right.

01:28.230 --> 01:28.980
How about the second one.

01:28.980 --> 01:34.080
Which of the following is equivalent to the unit of electrical resistance.

01:34.080 --> 01:41.010
All right so now we have different choices that involve cool ohms volts for an amp.

01:41.250 --> 01:46.410
We have Duell we have anyway a whole bunch of different units here for electrical resistance.

01:46.410 --> 01:48.270
Actually C might not be for cool.

01:48.270 --> 01:53.300
I'm actually probably pretty sure who it is but so electrical resistance.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.560
I would never ask you for units of something.

01:55.560 --> 01:58.740
Try to remember a simple equation that involves that quantities.

01:58.740 --> 02:00.340
So here we go.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.280
Ohm's law.

02:01.860 --> 02:07.460
So we know that the units of electrical resistance should be in units of volts divided by current.

02:07.980 --> 02:15.600
So that should be something in volts and current is measured in amperes So at the end of the day what

02:15.600 --> 02:19.230
you get is choice B that's volts divided by our peers.

02:19.230 --> 02:22.220
Pretty straightforward problem either is the first two.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.520
Hopefully you've got those.
