Everybody doctor you hear your physics ninja welcome.

00:03.720 --> 00:07.930
So this is the multiple choice section so I've got 30 different problems for you.

00:07.950 --> 00:11.040
A lot of kind of good problems just with resistors at the end.

00:11.040 --> 00:17.070
Throw in some capacitors and test your understanding of their shorter problems but they're going to

00:17.070 --> 00:21.380
test your comprehension hopefully kind of drill down what you've covered in the lectures.

00:21.390 --> 00:22.120
So good luck.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.890
The problem is the solutions are broken down.

00:23.890 --> 00:28.740
I've paired them up so the videos aren't too long they're kind of easy to get through the PBF is linked

00:28.740 --> 00:32.150
to this document at the end of the PTF is the answer key.

00:32.160 --> 00:35.380
But you've got to watch the videos to get all the details.

00:35.380 --> 00:35.600
All right.

00:35.610 --> 00:37.280
Good luck everybody you have some fun.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.730
Again if you ever have any questions reach out to me.

00:39.780 --> 00:40.730
