00:00.210 --> 00:01.660
All right here's problem three.

00:01.680 --> 00:08.040
We have a copper wire of length L and cross-sectional area A and then a second copper wire has the length

00:08.040 --> 00:16.320
to L and cross-sectional area for a what is the ratio of the resistivity of the second wire to the resistivity

00:16.320 --> 00:18.420
of the first wire.

00:18.470 --> 00:21.140
Now couple of things about this problem here.

00:21.220 --> 00:25.750
And remember what they're asking us here they're asking us for the resistivity.

00:25.870 --> 00:27.550
Now this is kind of a trick question.

00:27.660 --> 00:33.780
If you remember here the resistance of any wire can be written as the resistivity multiplied by the

00:33.780 --> 00:38.590
length of that wire Al and divided by the cross section.

00:38.760 --> 00:41.160
So there's two terms here.

00:41.170 --> 00:44.600
There's a term that is material dependent that's the resistivity.

00:44.700 --> 00:47.790
And in this case both wires here are made of copper.

00:47.810 --> 00:48.120
All right.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.090
We have one copper wire and we have another copper wire.

00:51.090 --> 00:57.540
So although we're changing the length in the cross-section between both wires we are certainly not changing

00:57.540 --> 01:03.030
the resistivity so we might change the resistance but we're not changing the resistivity.

01:03.180 --> 01:09.980
And if we're not changing the resists devotee that means that the correct answer must be e right you

01:10.050 --> 01:17.760
right the resistance of the first water as the resistivity of copper the length of the wires to 2L divided

01:17.760 --> 01:19.040
by 0.

01:19.050 --> 01:23.140
So it's only l divided by the cross-sectional area.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.230
Then you'd write the resistance of the second wire the same resistivity of the length.

01:28.230 --> 01:31.710
Now as to L and the cross-section is for a.

01:31.770 --> 01:36.630
So you could tell we've changed the resistance but we don't change the resistivity row because in both

01:36.630 --> 01:38.150
cases we have copper.

01:38.490 --> 01:38.980
All right.

01:38.980 --> 01:40.580
That was a trick question.

01:41.010 --> 01:47.460
Problem for if either the electric field strength in J is the electric current density What's the ratio

01:47.460 --> 01:48.660
of either J.

01:48.950 --> 01:58.110
OK well this is basically asking you about Ohm's Law remember electric field and the current density

01:58.110 --> 02:04.500
are related to each other and wrote this down as written to the conductivity multiplied by the electric

02:04.500 --> 02:06.150
field.

02:06.150 --> 02:11.400
Now if you look at all the choices here none of these involve the conductivity but they do involve both

02:11.400 --> 02:12.000
of my letters.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.230
The current density and the electric field strength.

02:15.420 --> 02:23.130
However if you do remember the conductivity was simply one divided by the resistivity of that material.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.130
And now we have to do is we simply have to rearrange this.

02:26.160 --> 02:32.460
So you bring row on one side you keep the electric field where it is and you divide through by the current

02:32.460 --> 02:36.160
density and you get the resistivity.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.440
So right away you're going right because the correct answer.

02:39.470 --> 02:42.060
So for this one you really had to kind of remember this.

02:42.050 --> 02:44.790
This was another form of Ohm's law.

02:44.970 --> 02:47.340
The more conventional form of Ohm's law is this one.
