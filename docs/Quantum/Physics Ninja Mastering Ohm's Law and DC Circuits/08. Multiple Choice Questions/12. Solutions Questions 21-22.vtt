00:00.150 --> 00:02.130
It here's problem 21.

00:02.180 --> 00:07.260
This is probably one of my favorite problems I think this is kind of a good one I think if you understand

00:07.260 --> 00:10.340
this when you understand a lot about what's going on here.

00:10.470 --> 00:17.040
So the circuit in the diagram here contains three light bulbs represented by these crosses here.

00:17.130 --> 00:19.160
Initially the switch is closed.

00:19.360 --> 00:19.800
OK.

00:19.820 --> 00:25.650
So and then which of the following is correct about how bright these light bulbs are.

00:25.650 --> 00:27.520
If you open the switch.

00:27.960 --> 00:31.060
So one little comment about this brightness.

00:31.290 --> 00:37.080
You're basically looking at the current How much current is flowing through that light bulb that's going

00:37.080 --> 00:40.110
to dictate how bright it is.

00:40.110 --> 00:41.790
So they either get brighter dimmer.

00:41.790 --> 00:43.180
They go out.

00:43.770 --> 00:44.010
All right.

00:44.010 --> 00:49.620
So we have to do is first you have to compare what's going on when the switch is closed and versus when

00:49.620 --> 00:50.700
it's open.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.430
So it's first to the case when it's closed.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.910
When it's close look what we have.

00:55.910 --> 01:01.290
And let's assume the resistance of each light bulb is are there all three identical light bulbs.

01:01.310 --> 01:06.590
So that means that the equivalent resistance of both of these that are in parallel if both of these

01:06.590 --> 01:12.870
are in parallel the equivalent resistance of both of those is going to be are over to and check that

01:12.870 --> 01:13.890
for yourself.

01:13.890 --> 01:16.010
And now you have to combine that with this guy.

01:16.020 --> 01:18.550
Both of these are in series with this one.

01:18.780 --> 01:26.620
So this here is really the total equivalent resistance when it's closed so Ohm's law says well it's

01:26.620 --> 01:28.840
determine how much current we have then.

01:29.270 --> 01:33.820
So again let me this right here this is one it's closed.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.910
This here is the equivalent resistance.

01:36.940 --> 01:37.310
All right.

01:37.310 --> 01:40.630
Ohm's law now says V equals to our eye.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.330
So if we want to find how much current kind of flows through the battery flows through this one we can

01:46.330 --> 01:51.130
use our equation with our equivalent resistor or we're going to find here is that the current eye has

01:51.130 --> 01:55.530
some voltage V and divided by my equivalent resistance.

01:55.570 --> 02:03.180
So that's 3R that a dividing by two digits being the two upstairs over here so let's go ahead and don't

02:03.190 --> 02:05.400
know where is this current in the circuit.

02:05.450 --> 02:12.650
So that means this is the current I hear it's also the same current flowing down here current flowing

02:12.650 --> 02:14.000
through the battery.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.440
Now what happens when I have a current I flowing into a junction that tells me that half of it is going

02:21.440 --> 02:24.620
to go here and half of it is going to go here.

02:24.620 --> 02:29.840
And the reason that it splits perfectly in half in this case is because the resistance of each path

02:29.840 --> 02:31.580
is the same.

02:31.580 --> 02:37.640
So that means the current down here has to be over three are.

02:37.700 --> 02:37.990
All right.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.500
So I mean write all that down.

02:39.590 --> 02:46.580
So that means that the current flowing through lightbulb three when it's closed is going to be going

02:46.610 --> 02:53.440
to is going to write this out as a as a firm as a as a floating point number two divided by three is

02:53.490 --> 03:03.560
0.66 be over are and what else the current now flowing through light bulb Number two is simply going

03:03.560 --> 03:10.330
to be a third a third a V over are which gives me zero point three three be over.

03:10.460 --> 03:11.090
All right.

03:11.210 --> 03:12.230
So that's case number one.

03:12.230 --> 03:18.860
Now I have to compare that now to what happens when the switch is open when it's open it goes like this.

03:18.890 --> 03:23.560
That means that I kind of get rid of some of this here.

03:23.810 --> 03:27.430
That means that the resistance of this upper branch is basically infinite.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.380
It means I really only have a single loop.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.790
So let's go do that one over here when it's open.

03:36.940 --> 03:43.220
The total resistance are equivalent simply going to be two times are.

03:44.290 --> 03:50.230
So that means now that the current flowing through both of them flowing through this one is going to

03:50.230 --> 03:53.920
be the same as the current flowing through light bulb number three.

03:54.280 --> 03:59.470
And this is going to be equal to the voltage divided by my total equivalent resistance which is two

03:59.470 --> 04:01.100
are.

04:01.120 --> 04:05.730
So this guy here gives me 0.5 V over.

04:06.850 --> 04:08.830
OK so what happens.

04:08.830 --> 04:11.920
So I started out when it's close at zero point three three.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.690
So what happens to the current through light bulb number.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.840
Light bulb two at one goes up.

04:19.840 --> 04:24.230
It increases it went from point three three 2.5.

04:24.250 --> 04:28.040
And what happens to the current flowing through light bulb number three.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.380
This one goes down

04:32.700 --> 04:34.930
so that one this one here is going to get dimmer.

04:35.280 --> 04:41.110
So we have gets brighter for number two goes down or get dimmer for bulb number three.

04:41.250 --> 04:46.560
The correct answer for this one has to be choice a little bit of a longer problem but I think it captures

04:46.560 --> 04:48.100
a lot of what's going on.

04:48.390 --> 04:51.170
Hopefully you understand this problem.

04:52.260 --> 04:53.270
Our problem 22.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.330
What's the current in the circuit above.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.920
This one is a little bit more straightforward.

04:57.960 --> 05:04.740
So I've got a two and three home that are in series and I've got a 6 in a 12 first that are in parallel

05:04.740 --> 05:05.730
with each other.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.900
So let me first just simplify both of those the equivalent resistance.

05:09.910 --> 05:12.660
There's only two of them that are in parallel with each other.

05:12.750 --> 05:17.310
You simply multiply them and you divide it by the sum.

05:18.090 --> 05:21.040
It could get rid of the six here put it three.

05:21.330 --> 05:26.390
Get rid of the 12 here put a four at the end you're simply left with forums.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.050
So that's simply that.

05:28.080 --> 05:37.240
Now the total equivalent resistance is going to be two plus for almost what I just calculated plus three

05:38.620 --> 05:41.520
which gives me six plus three nine.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.040
I have any volt battery.

05:44.230 --> 05:45.800
Pretty straightforward.

05:45.880 --> 05:56.070
The current is the voltage divided by my total are equivalent 18 over nine which gives me two.

05:57.130 --> 06:02.560
So if I go back to the circuit that means you'd have to over here you'd have to right up until the junction

06:02.910 --> 06:08.620
and you'd have some current that would split and you'd have to going through here to flowing through

06:08.620 --> 06:12.660
this two ohm resistor because the correct answer for this one.
