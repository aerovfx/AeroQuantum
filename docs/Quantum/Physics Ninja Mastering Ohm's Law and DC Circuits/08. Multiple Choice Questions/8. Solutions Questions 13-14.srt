It for problem 13 says the EAF of the batteries six volts when the battery delivers a current of 0.5

00:07.020 --> 00:12.270
amps to the external circuit the potential difference between the terminals of the battery is five point

00:12.270 --> 00:13.510
eight volts.

00:13.590 --> 00:16.310
The internal resistance of the battery is what.

00:16.320 --> 00:25.110
So again all we have to do for this one let's just consider a ideal battery is a six volt battery and

00:25.110 --> 00:33.360
it has some internal resistance trying to find and just consider this small segment of current.

00:33.390 --> 00:37.830
Now we're going to say there we're going to assume there is a current eye going through and the current

00:37.860 --> 00:40.660
EIS 0.5 amps.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.140
This ideal battery six volts we're really looking for what are is.

00:44.400 --> 00:50.430
And when we measure the potential difference between the ends what do we end up measuring is five point

00:50.430 --> 00:51.460
eight.

00:52.200 --> 00:56.970
So you can imagine here if we call this point A and Point B.

00:57.660 --> 01:02.270
So the difference of potential is 5.8 between points and point B.

01:02.510 --> 01:08.320
So let's just go from point A to Point B what would we get good V-A is equal to.

01:08.510 --> 01:09.170
Sorry.

01:09.780 --> 01:14.700
You get V-A where you start and now you go through those six full battery you get an increase of potential

01:14.700 --> 01:22.710
of six and then I get a drop equal to the current flowing through it multiplied by the internal resistance.

01:22.740 --> 01:25.650
Then you end up going all the way to point B.

01:25.650 --> 01:35.120
So let me just rearrange just a little bit so you get six minus I are equal to VB minus v.

01:35.700 --> 01:40.270
All right and VB VI of mine is V-A is my 5.8 volts.

01:40.270 --> 01:40.550
All right.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.590
So the only unknown again we know the current here is 0.5.

01:43.590 --> 01:48.660
So you simply have to just rearrange this equation a little bit.

01:48.660 --> 01:56.140
So you're going to get six minus five point eight equals to zero point five multiplied by R..

01:56.160 --> 02:00.720
This guy gives me 0.2 0.5 r.

02:00.740 --> 02:06.550
So at the end you get Rs 0.4 ohms OK.

02:07.090 --> 02:09.130
0.2 divided by 0.5.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.400
So the correct answer for this one has to be choice.

02:13.210 --> 02:13.450
All right.

02:13.450 --> 02:20.140
Hubble 14:14 says a wire is connected to a battery of a constant voltage and negligible internal resistance

02:20.950 --> 02:24.180
by decreasing which of the following.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.730
Can we increase the power dissipated in the wire.

02:28.400 --> 02:28.760
Rs.

02:28.800 --> 02:35.550
So what we have here again with value for the resistance is the resists Dev-T the length and divided

02:35.550 --> 02:36.660
by the area.

02:36.660 --> 02:37.980
Now we have different choices here.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.290
We can play with the length.

02:39.300 --> 02:43.350
Here let me maybe switch the notation here so that we have the same thing.

02:43.350 --> 02:47.060
D is the diameter of the wire row's the resistivity.

02:47.250 --> 02:52.270
So all we want to do if we want to increase the power we have a fixed voltage.

02:52.290 --> 02:56.710
Again our power now is simply this V squared over r.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.470
So how would I increase the power I want to make.

03:00.470 --> 03:05.930
Are as small as possible and I do that by well.

03:06.090 --> 03:09.650
If I make l small thats going to make the resistance small.

03:09.780 --> 03:14.820
If I make d small Now thats going to make the resistance big because I'm going to make the cross-sectional

03:14.820 --> 03:20.510
area small if I divide by a small number that's going to increase my resistance.

03:20.790 --> 03:23.130
So certainly can't be Alan.

03:23.670 --> 03:30.360
How about choice C choice C has decrease L and the resistivity both of those are in the numerator over

03:30.360 --> 03:30.570
here.

03:30.570 --> 03:35.460
So if you do decrease both of those you're going to end up decreasing the resistance which is what we

03:35.460 --> 03:37.860
want so that one works.

03:37.860 --> 03:44.460
We've already said it can't be d so it's not only the resistance L it's really both of them have the

03:44.460 --> 03:50.280
same effect of increasing the power dissipated in that wire.

03:50.290 --> 03:52.050
It seems the correct answer for this point.
