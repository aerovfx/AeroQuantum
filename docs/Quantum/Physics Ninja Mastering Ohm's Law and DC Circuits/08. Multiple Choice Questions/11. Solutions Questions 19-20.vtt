00:00.360 --> 00:05.790
All right next one 19 we have three identical resistors are connected to each other in these four different

00:05.790 --> 00:12.000
combinations so let's just say each one of them has a value are which of the given circuits now has

00:12.000 --> 00:14.490
the greatest resistance.

00:14.490 --> 00:14.840
All right.

00:14.850 --> 00:18.470
Well this one is kind of straightforward.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.800
Should it be able to answer it right away.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.930
Should be able to answer this one if you have three in series that's always going to be bigger than

00:24.930 --> 00:28.500
anything you're going to do with a parallel combination.

00:28.500 --> 00:33.750
You know that in this case here you're going to get 3R is going to be the equivalent resistance if you

00:33.750 --> 00:35.100
did this one over here.

00:35.230 --> 00:40.690
Well think about what you'd get if I write it out as one over our equivalent.

00:40.740 --> 00:46.160
What I'm going to do is I'm going to have one over our plus one over our last one over.

00:46.170 --> 00:50.430
Are you going to have three of those.

00:50.430 --> 00:56.160
So at the end what you're going to end up getting is are over three or both that that's going to be

00:56.160 --> 01:01.960
the equivalent resistance for the first combination and if you do the other two combinations again now

01:01.970 --> 01:05.810
if you multiply these ones multiply them and divide it by two.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.050
All right.

01:06.050 --> 01:09.950
You could first start by simplifying both of those.

01:10.430 --> 01:17.720
And what you're going to get here again if you multiply both of those you get are squared divided by

01:17.720 --> 01:20.100
two are.

01:20.150 --> 01:22.240
So for both of those you get are over two.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.040
And then here you have to add this guy.

01:25.050 --> 01:26.790
This one here as in series.

01:27.080 --> 01:35.690
So the total equivalent resistance for the fourth branch over here becomes r plus R over 2 which is

01:35.690 --> 01:41.500
three halfs are still smaller than the three are now you're going to redo this one here.

01:41.540 --> 01:44.390
Again when you're going to end up getting somewhere in between.

01:44.390 --> 01:49.820
So go ahead and do that one but it's really three is the only one that's going to give you the largest

01:49.820 --> 01:55.070
resistance for this one for this middle one here what you would do again.

01:55.070 --> 01:58.470
First you combine both of those both of those are in series.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.600
So combined both of those These will be equal to two are.

02:02.630 --> 02:07.310
And then I have to are that is in parallel with one resistance.

02:07.330 --> 02:10.820
Our Go ahead and calculate the equivalent one you'll still find.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.700
This one's the biggest problem.

02:13.700 --> 02:17.290
Twenty says a wire of resistance are dissipates power.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.240
When is a current that goes through it.

02:20.330 --> 02:24.970
The wire is replaced by another wire now that has three times the resistance.

02:24.980 --> 02:30.020
The power dissipated by the new wire when the same current goes through it.

02:30.020 --> 02:31.050
Let me highlight that.

02:31.070 --> 02:33.020
That's kind of important.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.190
All right is what.

02:34.290 --> 02:38.810
Well do kind of case one versus case 2.

02:39.020 --> 02:45.320
This is a comparison we know were given the value of the resistance and the current probably the best

02:45.320 --> 02:49.430
way to write it simply are squared.

02:49.430 --> 02:49.670
All right.

02:49.670 --> 02:56.180
So what happens over here while the power for Case number two P2 What's the value of the resistance.

02:56.180 --> 02:59.190
It's three times the resistance.

02:59.190 --> 03:04.200
So what they told us and the problem now the key point here is that so they've changed the voltage here

03:04.200 --> 03:08.380
obviously than in the other case because what we want is the same current passing through it.

03:08.610 --> 03:12.530
If the same current passes through it we still get just simply I.

03:12.990 --> 03:18.920
So at the end of the day this one here P2 is simply three times P1

03:22.890 --> 03:24.240
three times.

03:24.690 --> 03:27.470
So does the correct answer for this one.
