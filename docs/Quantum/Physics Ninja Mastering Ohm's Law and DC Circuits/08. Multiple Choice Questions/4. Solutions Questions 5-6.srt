I'll read Question Five says we have two tungsten wires with different cross sections.

00:04.290 --> 00:10.080
One is a the other one is to a different Currence they're shown here and at the end they want to know

00:10.080 --> 00:16.180
what is the ratio of the drift velocity of the particles in the second wire to that first wire.

00:16.250 --> 00:16.540
All right.

00:16.560 --> 00:22.890
So we're looking for VD that's the drif philosophy and we're basically given things about the geometry

00:22.890 --> 00:27.530
of the wire and information about the current flowing through it.

00:27.540 --> 00:34.760
So if you remember now that let's do a wire one over here call this wire two over here.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.060
All right.

00:35.060 --> 00:39.810
And really the equation we need is that the current How is that related to the drift velocity if you

00:39.810 --> 00:47.880
remember it was the number density and it was the charge of the electron multiplied by the cross-sectional

00:47.880 --> 00:57.890
area and multiplied by the drift velocity is how we related our current to that drift velocity of the

00:57.890 --> 01:00.530
electrons flowing down the wire.

01:00.530 --> 01:05.720
So the end is the number density is the charge of each electron.

01:05.720 --> 01:12.390
Both of these are going to be the same because we're talking about two tungsten wires so n is a material

01:12.390 --> 01:16.160
property is just the basic charge of the electron So that's the same for both.

01:16.350 --> 01:17.870
So what are really doing then.

01:17.910 --> 01:22.840
And we want to know the drift velocity so let's just isolate the drift philosophy for wire 1.

01:22.920 --> 01:28.110
So we have that the drift velocity here is going to be equal to the current the current is simply I

01:29.950 --> 01:37.680
see over this one here it's simply an email divided by the cross-sectional area.

01:37.750 --> 01:43.550
Now for the second wire the drift velocity in this case the current now is four.

01:43.550 --> 01:45.730
I.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.400
What else.

01:46.430 --> 01:48.230
And an e remain the same.

01:48.230 --> 01:52.330
And now the cross-section is to a.

01:52.460 --> 01:56.650
So this one here we could simplify this a little bit at the end the expression becomes two.

01:57.020 --> 02:03.830
And again I and E multiplied by a I just divided for over two and just took that term outside.

02:04.130 --> 02:08.080
So you see at the end now what we're left with if we're asked for the drift velocity of the second wire

02:08.120 --> 02:12.290
this one divided by this one which you're going to end up doing now is we're going to end up getting

02:12.290 --> 02:14.860
the value of two because it's two times bigger.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.540
So that's it for number five.

02:18.570 --> 02:23.940
All right here's number six says the following graphs represent the resistivity as a function of the

02:23.940 --> 02:25.650
absolute temperature.

02:25.650 --> 02:31.560
Keep that in mind as a function of temperature which are the graph shows the resistivity change of a

02:31.560 --> 02:33.110
metallic wire.

02:33.330 --> 02:33.680
All right.

02:33.690 --> 02:39.120
So metal what happens when I increase the temperature it is the resist Dev-T change.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.950
Or does it get lower or does it get bigger.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.090
What certainly doesn't stay constant.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.300
It's actually just crossed that one out.

02:45.710 --> 02:50.280
All right this means that the resistivity would not depend on the temperature and you should remember

02:50.280 --> 02:56.470
from the class that for metals the resistivity increases with temperature so can't be that one it's

02:56.590 --> 02:58.130
really can't be this one.

02:58.150 --> 03:03.150
All right so we're left with both of those and this was one of the properties that as you increase the

03:03.150 --> 03:09.360
temperature over a pretty broad range for most metals you can get a linear dependence which means that

03:09.360 --> 03:14.480
the resistivity is proportional to the absolute temperature.

03:14.770 --> 03:16.220
OK.

03:16.290 --> 03:19.320
So there you have it folks so this one.

03:19.320 --> 03:23.460
Just knowing a little bit of how material properties change with temperature you'd be able to answer

03:23.460 --> 03:24.010
that question.
