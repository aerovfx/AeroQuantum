00:00.330 --> 00:02.040
All right so here's example too.

00:02.250 --> 00:09.780
So we've got a surrogate with a 1 micro ferrite capacitor and a resistance of 10 Kila ohms at time T

00:09.780 --> 00:14.400
equals to zero we're given there's an initial charge on those plates of two micro Coolum.

00:14.610 --> 00:20.010
They're telling us now or asking us what is the charge on the capacitor when time equals the five milli

00:20.010 --> 00:20.760
seconds.

00:20.940 --> 00:24.160
So again this is just the standard discharge circuit.

00:24.180 --> 00:24.480
Right.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.670
So it's one resistor.

00:25.670 --> 00:29.000
Very easy one capacitor very easy.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.310
And that's it.

00:31.660 --> 00:37.490
And the reason we're going to have some where we have initially charged it here right so we have some

00:37.490 --> 00:40.230
initial charge let's just put it on this plate here.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.950
So positive two times ten to the minus 6.

00:42.950 --> 00:47.350
Cool ohms is my initial charge.

00:47.510 --> 00:55.480
This capacitor or sorry this resistor over here is 10 Keela ohms That's 10000 ohms.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.270
That's our value are.

00:57.820 --> 01:03.940
Now that said we know it's discharging so the charge is a function of time on these plates is given

01:03.940 --> 01:05.280
by Qs 0.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.330
Same as last time.

01:06.330 --> 01:12.490
Exponential of minus the time divided by the time constant which is R C for this case.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.780
That's all there is to it.

01:13.780 --> 01:19.120
So it's kind of the opposite of example one example one we were told what the final charge is you are

01:19.120 --> 01:23.490
asked to calculate the time in this case it's more straightforward because they tell you the time.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.850
All you have to do is calculate what this final charges.

01:26.890 --> 01:33.610
So this is two times tend to the negative six multiplied by exponential of minus.

01:33.610 --> 01:38.590
Now five seconds that's five times ten to the minus three seconds.

01:39.940 --> 01:42.640
Divided by are 10000

01:45.420 --> 01:50.990
multiplied by the capacitance one times ten to the negative six.

01:51.000 --> 01:51.240
All right.

01:51.240 --> 01:53.820
Substitute everything into the calculator.

01:53.970 --> 01:56.690
You get the charge.

01:56.700 --> 02:04.470
Q Should give you about one point two one times ten to the negative six Coolum which is the same thing

02:04.470 --> 02:10.990
as 1.2 1 micro Coolum That's how much charge there is left on the plates after five milliseconds.

02:11.310 --> 02:11.570
OK.

02:11.580 --> 02:16.250
Pretty straightforward application of our equation here for discharging a capacitor.
