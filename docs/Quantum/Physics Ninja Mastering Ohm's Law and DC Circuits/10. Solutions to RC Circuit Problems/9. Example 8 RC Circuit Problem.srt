00:00.240 --> 00:01.270
All right here's an example.

00:01.290 --> 00:07.290
We have an RC circuit problem says the capacitor in the circuit shown is initially charged as the six

00:07.290 --> 00:13.650
micro ferrett capacitor find the current through the four ohm resistor and through the 8 ohm resistor

00:14.040 --> 00:15.270
in these different time limits.

00:15.270 --> 00:20.580
So immediately after you close the switch and then after a long time when the switch has been closed

00:21.120 --> 00:28.010
and then also find the charge on the capacitor after a long time after you've closed the switch.

00:28.350 --> 00:32.760
OK so let's first look at kind of right after T goes to zero.

00:32.760 --> 00:35.080
Let me just call it the zero here.

00:35.520 --> 00:39.490
Remember what happens that goes to zero and you first close the switch.

00:39.510 --> 00:42.250
The trick now is you can redraw the circuit.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.670
It basically behaves.

00:44.820 --> 00:46.850
This forum is still going to be there.

00:46.890 --> 00:48.620
The switch is closed.

00:48.830 --> 00:53.750
The Forum lets also draw the aid on that one still there.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.900
We close this branch.

00:58.290 --> 00:59.460
Here's the 8 ohm.

00:59.990 --> 01:08.450
And remember immediately after you close the switch the capacitor behaves as though it's shorted.

01:08.660 --> 01:14.340
So that basically means like you have this additional branch here where there's nothing there.

01:14.660 --> 01:20.330
It basically means that the resistance of this branch here is effectively zero.

01:20.990 --> 01:26.640
So if it's zero it means that if you go from point B all the way to point B.

01:27.080 --> 01:33.920
Well if you go through this outer branch there is no voltage drop across this outer branch because the

01:33.920 --> 01:35.340
resistance is zero.

01:35.990 --> 01:41.750
And that means if this 8 ohm branch is in parallel with this one there is no voltage drop across this

01:41.840 --> 01:43.470
8 ohm resistor.

01:43.910 --> 01:49.700
So that automatically tells you that the current through this middle section through that 8 ohm at least

01:49.700 --> 01:55.430
in the short time limit this current here has to be equal to zero because all the current is basically

01:55.520 --> 02:01.520
going to just go in the outside of whatever current flowing through this 4 ohm resistor is basically

02:01.520 --> 02:05.720
going to continue along this branch and no current is going to go through the center.

02:05.750 --> 02:11.710
So this problem becomes very very simple with just a single branch and the resistance is four ohms.

02:11.780 --> 02:16.760
The total resistance of that single branch in the short time limit the voltage of the battery is 12

02:16.760 --> 02:18.260
volts.

02:18.260 --> 02:24.080
You automatically know then that the current initially has to be three amps and you get that from the

02:24.080 --> 02:29.690
12 divided by for 12 volts divided by forums gives you three amps.

02:29.690 --> 02:30.980
OK so we know that one.

02:30.980 --> 02:35.230
And also Well we know that was the current through the four ohm resistor.

02:35.330 --> 02:38.180
The current through the 8 ohm resistor is zero.

02:39.510 --> 02:39.990
All right.

02:40.140 --> 02:46.950
What about now in the limit where time is long Let's just call it infinity and it's really long with

02:46.950 --> 02:51.630
respect to the time constant of this particular circuit.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.100
All right.

02:52.260 --> 02:54.140
So in that long time limit.

02:54.150 --> 02:55.600
Remember what happens now.

02:55.740 --> 03:06.120
Well you get a voltage across this capacitor and after a long time there is no current flowing through

03:06.450 --> 03:08.970
a branch where there is a capacitor.

03:08.970 --> 03:14.600
So that means if there's no current basically it's basically an open circuit over there.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.440
So you still have this forum resistor.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.620
The switch is closed now.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.670
We still have our 8 ohm resistor.

03:22.960 --> 03:31.340
Let's finish off this branch and now you basically have an open circuit over here so there is no current

03:31.340 --> 03:36.040
flowing through this outer branch.

03:36.130 --> 03:37.650
I must be equal to zero.

03:37.690 --> 03:41.330
If it's open the resistance basically is infinite.

03:41.620 --> 03:45.260
So here you still have the 8 ohm here you still have the forum.

03:45.670 --> 03:47.670
And here we still have a 12 volt battery.

03:47.680 --> 03:52.450
So now you could see that the branch that we're interested in it's really again just a single loop circuit

03:52.840 --> 03:56.110
the total equivalent resistance is 12 ohms.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.230
The voltage of the battery is 12.

03:58.420 --> 04:04.600
You automatically can right that the current through the forum resistor has to be equal to the current

04:04.600 --> 04:11.270
through the 8 ohm resistor and must be equal to 12 divided by 12 which gives me 1 amp.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.820
So that's the current After a long time.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.100
Now find the charge.

04:15.100 --> 04:20.410
So he said you're going to eventually charge up this capacitor and there's going to be no current.

04:20.410 --> 04:25.330
So what is the actual voltage now across from point C to point B.

04:25.510 --> 04:30.370
So in order to answer that one I'm going to do now is I'm simply going to choose a loop and when to

04:30.370 --> 04:34.440
choose a loop that kind of goes around here remember that switch is closed.

04:34.480 --> 04:40.120
I want to introduce what I want to introduce the voltage across that capacitor so I'm going to choose

04:40.120 --> 04:44.390
this exterior loop here and let's use Kirchhoff's loop rule here.

04:44.470 --> 04:51.040
So if I start at point f the first thing I encounter is a 12 volt battery so I get plus 12.

04:51.040 --> 04:57.170
Now I'm going across the four ohm resistor and I know there's a current of one amp so I get minus four

04:57.220 --> 04:59.020
volts across this resistor.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.480
Four times one.

05:00.730 --> 05:03.780
And then I go all the way to point seen on going across the capacitors.

05:03.800 --> 05:09.560
I'm going to get a voltage across the capacitor and go back to point f I get zero.

05:09.990 --> 05:12.920
So automatically burn VC on the other side.

05:13.090 --> 05:16.660
You left that the voltage across the capacitor gives me 8 volts.

05:16.660 --> 05:21.940
Right it's not equal to 12 volts in this case because there's also a voltage drop across this forum

05:21.970 --> 05:29.590
resistor and you also know that the voltage drop across this capacitor has to be the voltage drop across

05:29.590 --> 05:30.520
the 8 ohm resistor.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.880
Both of those branches are in parallel.

05:33.150 --> 05:38.110
I could have done that the voltage drop across the 8 ohm resistor is simply eight times the current

05:38.740 --> 05:41.160
which gives me 8 volts.

05:41.270 --> 05:41.620
All right.

05:41.620 --> 05:45.050
Now I'm asking for what is the charge after a long time.

05:45.190 --> 05:50.980
If you know the voltage you know the value of the capacitance you automatically know that the charge

05:51.940 --> 05:56.260
is simply a capacitance multiplied by the voltage.

05:56.260 --> 06:03.160
In this case it's six times ten to the minus six multiplied by eight.

06:03.220 --> 06:14.500
This gives me 48 charges 48 times ten to the minus six which gives me 48 micro Koolau so that the final

06:14.500 --> 06:16.590
charge on this capacitor.

06:16.620 --> 06:16.920
OK.

06:16.930 --> 06:21.730
Kind of a simple problem but it's important to understand these two time limits and how to calculate

06:21.730 --> 06:23.590
things.
