00:00.150 --> 00:06.330
Art first RC circuits example problem here we have a resistance of one kill ohm and a capacitance of

00:06.330 --> 00:07.840
two micro Feraud.

00:07.950 --> 00:14.120
What time is required for the capacitor to discharge 99 percent of its original value.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.420
Her original charge.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.070
I mean that really is the key right here.

00:17.080 --> 00:18.990
You're doing a discharge case.

00:18.990 --> 00:24.510
If you do a discharge you should remember that the charge is a function of time.

00:24.510 --> 00:26.490
Remember it's some exponential decay.

00:26.490 --> 00:33.180
So it really is some initial value multiplied by this exponential function and since it's a decay it's

00:33.180 --> 00:38.830
minus T divided by R C was the time constant.

00:38.880 --> 00:39.600
All right.

00:39.600 --> 00:45.270
So we know what R is you know what the capacitance is is to micro Feraud what we need Knows What do

00:45.270 --> 00:45.800
we do with this.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.570
Ninety nine percent of its original charge.

00:48.600 --> 00:55.420
So if the original charges zero how much charge do you have left if you've discharged 99 percent.

00:55.740 --> 01:02.280
So what you should know is that the charge that we have now is really only 1 percent Leffe.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.430
So it's one over a.

01:03.450 --> 01:10.220
Multiplied by the initial charge this is how much charge you have left if you've discharged 99 percent.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.810
So now we simply substitute things into here.

01:13.230 --> 01:19.080
And the same thing exponential of mine is t divided by r c.

01:19.590 --> 01:22.490
Ok so now we can simplify this expression a little bit.

01:22.710 --> 01:29.050
You can cross out the Q knots and now really what you're asking for now is what time.

01:29.070 --> 01:32.900
So we're really looking for just this time over here we know everything else in this equation.

01:32.940 --> 01:34.990
You simply have to isolate the time.

01:35.010 --> 01:40.120
So if you take the natural log on each side the natural log of one over a hundred.

01:40.870 --> 01:45.090
And this is going to be equal if you take natural log of an exponential you're simply left with the

01:45.090 --> 01:46.720
argument.

01:46.740 --> 01:51.660
Now you might think well isn't time going to be negative here from the right hand side of this equation.

01:51.870 --> 01:56.730
Well actually it's not because natural log of a fraction will also give me a negative number.

01:56.730 --> 02:03.210
So the last thing you got to do now is simply isolate the time and we're going to have an expression

02:03.210 --> 02:11.790
now is simply going to be equal to minus R C multiplied by the natural log of one divided by 100.

02:11.820 --> 02:14.820
Substituting everything we get.

02:14.820 --> 02:16.990
Now just make sure you're working in S-I units here.

02:17.010 --> 02:24.140
We're going to get minus one kill OAM is 1000 multiplied by two micro Feraud.

02:24.570 --> 02:32.130
That's 2.0 times ten to the minus 6 is micro and multiply by natural law of 1 over 100.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.710
All right so now you substitute the numbers in there.

02:34.740 --> 02:43.000
What you get is that the time is equal to nine point two multiplied by 10 to the minus three seconds.

02:43.520 --> 02:47.140
And that simply looks like $9.2 seconds.

02:47.390 --> 02:51.930
You kind of a standard this charging a capacitor problem.

02:52.050 --> 02:52.820
Hopefully you got that one.
