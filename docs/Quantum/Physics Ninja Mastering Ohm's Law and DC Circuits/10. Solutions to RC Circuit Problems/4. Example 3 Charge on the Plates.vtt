All right here's example three called charge on the plates.

00:04.110 --> 00:09.680
So we have a 10 mega ohm resistor that's connected in series to a 1 micro ferrite capacitor.

00:09.810 --> 00:16.140
And in this case here there's also a 12 volt battery at time equals to zero the capacitors on charge.

00:16.140 --> 00:21.450
They're asking you what fraction of the final charge is on the plate that time equals the 46 seconds

00:21.450 --> 00:26.460
that the longtime And here are kind of five different choices.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.710
There's nothing you can really guess.

00:27.710 --> 00:29.880
You actually just have to solve the problem.

00:29.940 --> 00:34.050
Again this is a circuit here the charging circuit.

00:34.050 --> 00:35.620
So it looks something like this.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.420
We have a battery.

00:38.780 --> 00:40.670
We have a resistor.

00:41.090 --> 00:45.590
And then we're going to have our capacitor over here.

00:45.590 --> 00:45.880
All right.

00:45.890 --> 00:54.530
So just a basic circuit that we've seen value of the capacitance over here is one micro one times ten

00:54.530 --> 01:06.950
to the minus 6 Feraud the value of the resistance is ten and Mega is ten times ten to the six ohms.

01:06.950 --> 01:11.080
And then the value of the battery here is a 12 volt battery.

01:11.330 --> 01:11.870
OK.

01:12.230 --> 01:16.700
Other important information that tell us is it's initially uncharged.

01:16.850 --> 01:18.890
If it's initially an charge it means two things.

01:18.890 --> 01:22.490
It means the initial charge q zero is zero.

01:22.730 --> 01:26.920
And it also means that the voltage the initial voltage across the plates is zero.

01:27.350 --> 01:27.560
Right.

01:27.560 --> 01:34.610
Remember our basic capacitor equation is that the charge at any time equals to C multiplied by the voltage

01:34.610 --> 01:36.160
at any time.

01:36.170 --> 01:38.860
All right so what do we have going on here.

01:39.260 --> 01:43.910
As soon as you kind of connect this system here you're going to start building charge on the plates.

01:43.910 --> 01:49.490
If you plot the charge of the function of time remember what it looks like it looks like this exponential

01:49.490 --> 01:50.210
function.

01:50.480 --> 01:58.940
And this tends toward some saturation value some final value and the value over here simply see multiplied

01:58.940 --> 02:01.130
by the voltage of the battery.

02:01.370 --> 02:05.800
That's the final charge and for the charging case our equation now was.

02:05.900 --> 02:11.790
Q As a function of time equals to my final charge which is C multiplied by V.

02:12.380 --> 02:19.630
And now the time dependence looks like this minus T over R C.

02:20.120 --> 02:20.350
All right.

02:20.360 --> 02:26.870
And this function over here is represented by kind of this sketch over here as time gets very very big

02:27.230 --> 02:33.440
this term here doesn't matter anymore and you're simply left with c times V multiplied by 1.

02:33.440 --> 02:38.000
All right let's have a look at our equation now and see what they want they want which fraction of the

02:38.000 --> 02:39.560
final charge.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.240
All right what is the fraction of the final charge.

02:42.500 --> 02:48.590
Well that's actually what they're really asking for here is q of T multiplied by the final charge the

02:48.590 --> 02:51.320
final charge is c times V K.

02:51.320 --> 02:54.110
This is the final charge.

02:54.140 --> 02:56.630
Let me just make a note of that.

02:56.720 --> 03:01.800
Q f the final charges C multiplied by the voltage of the battery.

03:02.450 --> 03:08.960
So really all are really asked in this problem then is to evaluate this function exponential of minus

03:08.990 --> 03:12.290
T over R C.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.790
Substitute the values.

03:13.790 --> 03:19.420
Now we have one minus exponential minus 46.

03:19.430 --> 03:28.350
It's already in seconds and divided by 1 times 10 of the minus 6 multiplied by 10.

03:28.460 --> 03:33.470
Ten of the six actually see this tend to the 6 and 10 to the minus 6 they're simply going to cancel

03:33.470 --> 03:33.880
out.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.030
So really you're going to be left with 10 over here.

03:37.220 --> 03:41.680
So once you substitute this in to your calculator you should evaluate something that comes up to zero

03:41.680 --> 03:43.470
point nine nine.

03:44.220 --> 03:45.440
OK.

03:45.470 --> 03:51.680
So really after 46 seconds if I look on this graph you're really kind of right here at the end right

03:51.770 --> 03:53.630
if this is 46 seconds.

03:53.840 --> 04:00.420
You're at ninety nine percent of the final charge that you're going to get if you let this go on forever.

04:00.830 --> 04:04.190
All right you've got ninety nine percent of the way there.

04:04.610 --> 04:08.430
So kind of a standard charging at the plates.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.240
Hopefully you kind of understand this one.
