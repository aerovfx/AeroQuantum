Here's example for untitled the voltage after a long time and it says I'm like.

00:04.900 --> 00:10.410
So after a long time current exists only in one branch of the circuit at this long time if the battery

00:10.410 --> 00:15.700
voltage is 10 volts What's the voltage across the 50 micro ferrite capacitor.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.590
So let's go ahead and look at that.

00:17.670 --> 00:20.140
Here's my 50 micro farit capacitor.

00:20.490 --> 00:26.560
And we know that the voltage of this battery right here this guy here equals the 10 volts.

00:26.700 --> 00:26.970
All right.

00:26.970 --> 00:28.110
So how do you solve a problem like this.

00:28.110 --> 00:30.320
I mean this looks like a very complicated circuit.

00:30.510 --> 00:36.450
However we know what's going on here we know the voltage between the point a here and the top portion.

00:36.510 --> 00:38.430
We know that 10.

00:38.490 --> 00:43.790
We also want to know the voltage across this 50 micro ferrett capacitor.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.820
If you want to know the voltage across something well maybe we could just do like a little Bruel and

00:47.820 --> 00:52.790
include that 50 micro ferrite capacitor.

00:52.800 --> 00:58.190
Now let's just label some current over here and call the current here I call it.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.370
I won.

00:59.370 --> 00:59.850
All right.

00:59.940 --> 01:05.080
Let's start at a point and let's do this counter-clockwise loop and apply Kirchhoff's loop rule.

01:05.400 --> 01:10.440
So the first thing we encounter is a battery we go from the low potential to the high potential therefore

01:10.440 --> 01:13.500
we get a potential increase.

01:13.500 --> 01:19.020
Next thing we do is we're going across this 100 ohm resistor so you get a voltage drop of minus 100

01:19.460 --> 01:25.650
multiplied by 1 and next thing I want to do is I'm going across the plates of this capacitor so we get

01:25.650 --> 01:31.440
a voltage drop or a voltage across this capacitor and micro ferrite capacitor and then I go back to

01:31.440 --> 01:33.830
where I started that must be equal to zero.

01:34.440 --> 01:38.110
OK so really this is what we're looking for we know this is 10.

01:38.510 --> 01:39.030
What are we.

01:39.030 --> 01:40.590
What can we do about this term over here.

01:40.590 --> 01:43.470
The voltage drop across that resistor.

01:43.590 --> 01:48.090
Well the key to this problem now is just to kind of read it a little bit more carefully.

01:48.240 --> 01:54.600
And the first thing you realize here is that they're really asking you for what is a long time after

01:54.600 --> 01:58.890
a long time what happens after a long time.

01:58.990 --> 02:05.250
You have to remember that these capacitors they get fully charged and once they get fully charged it

02:05.280 --> 02:12.280
automatically means that any branch with a capacitor is going to have zero current.

02:12.900 --> 02:18.180
So this guy over here I one has to be equal to zero after a long time.

02:18.210 --> 02:24.680
So if I want equals to zero after a long time that means there is no voltage drop across that resistor.

02:24.780 --> 02:30.300
So automatically you can write that if I bring the voltage of the 50 micro Feraud capacitor on the other

02:30.300 --> 02:33.900
side so I'll turn it into a positive.

02:34.050 --> 02:39.540
That is simply equal to the AMFA the battery which in this case they told us was 10 volts.

02:39.600 --> 02:41.200
So that's pretty simple.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.970
So in this case here the correct answer has to be Choice C.

02:45.210 --> 02:50.300
So that would also mean that the for this branch over here.

02:50.700 --> 02:57.450
Go ahead and look at this for this branch over here after a long time there would also be no current

02:57.450 --> 03:01.050
flowing through this branch over here after a long time.

03:01.080 --> 03:03.960
So after a long time there is still a closed loop.

03:04.110 --> 03:04.870
Right.

03:04.890 --> 03:06.750
There's still a loop that includes the battery.

03:06.760 --> 03:13.350
There's this outside path and the current can still flow around there's just no more current flowing

03:14.070 --> 03:17.280
where there's a capacitor OK.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.510
Kind of a nice little problem it looks like a complicated circuit but it actually turned out to be quite

03:21.510 --> 03:23.030
an easy problem.
