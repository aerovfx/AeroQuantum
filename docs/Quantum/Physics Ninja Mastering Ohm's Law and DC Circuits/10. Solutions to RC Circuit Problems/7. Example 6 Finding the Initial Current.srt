00:00.440 --> 00:07.680
All right here is example six us finding the initial current is a good surrogate here with a bunch of

00:07.680 --> 00:12.610
resistor and a whole series of capacitors and one battery and it's switched a named meter.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.270
So here is the problem it goes to zero.

00:14.280 --> 00:17.010
All capacitors are discharge.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.020
So the voltage across each one is zero.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.050
And then that switches move from the open to the close.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.560
Let's go ahead and close that up.

00:24.920 --> 00:25.370
OK.

00:25.400 --> 00:32.390
And what's the current now through this branch through the e-meter just after Segal's to zero.

00:32.590 --> 00:32.860
All right.

00:32.860 --> 00:33.760
So what does that mean.

00:33.770 --> 00:36.130
Well how do we analyze circuits like this.

00:36.160 --> 00:42.280
The first thing you have to realize is that in this time limit at T equals to zero we have a rule right

00:42.610 --> 00:45.560
at Teagle zero just after T equals to zero.

00:45.670 --> 00:51.070
What happens is the way you deal with capacitors is you basically just short them.

00:51.070 --> 00:55.120
So it's as though you connect wire right here and you connect them.

00:55.120 --> 00:59.380
So let's go through all our capacitors and kind of just do this.

00:59.590 --> 01:00.510
That's what it looks like.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.380
Time equals to zero.

01:02.380 --> 01:03.490
Now you have to think about it.

01:03.490 --> 01:07.910
So now you imagine there's current currents flowing here it's going to hit a junction.

01:07.960 --> 01:14.530
So what happens now when you have a path here with zero resistance and then you have a path with 25

01:14.530 --> 01:20.710
ohms up here whereas the current going to go where the current is going to go through the path of least

01:20.710 --> 01:21.920
resistance.

01:21.940 --> 01:27.760
It also means that any branch that's in parallel with something that's shorted is not going to have

01:27.760 --> 01:28.480
any current.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.460
So you can forget about that.

01:30.550 --> 01:32.170
Where else do we have a situation.

01:32.170 --> 01:39.190
Well we also have this one this 25 here is also in parallel with this 10 micro Feraud capacitor which

01:39.190 --> 01:44.320
means that if the current is given a choice once it gets to that junction it's basically just going

01:44.320 --> 01:46.600
to go through that branch.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.970
All right the next thing we want to do now.

01:49.000 --> 01:49.280
OK.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.580
Now we have to analyze this circuit a little bit.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.040
So we're first going to do now that we've eliminated two of those resistors.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.910
But let's have a look at what's going on now.

01:59.170 --> 02:03.110
If we draw a loop so where is the current going to go it's going to go like this.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.180
It's going to go through here.

02:06.310 --> 02:14.410
It could go all the way out here could come back here could flow through here like that part of the

02:14.410 --> 02:18.520
current now could also once it gets over here that we still have a junction here there's still this

02:18.520 --> 02:20.030
path that it can go through.

02:20.230 --> 02:25.060
You just don't have access to this 25 ohm resistor because it just prefers to go through the path of

02:25.060 --> 02:27.650
least resistance which is out here.

02:27.670 --> 02:28.000
All right.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.030
So that means we have the green branch and then we have this orange one well basically both of those

02:34.030 --> 02:40.270
are if you look at this here the outer branch has a resistance of 25 ohms.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.510
The middle branch has a resistance of 50 ohms.

02:43.540 --> 02:48.340
So what you can do is you can kind of group both of those and these are in parallel with each other.

02:48.610 --> 02:55.310
So you can replace both of these resistors with an equivalent resistor and the equivalent resistor.

02:55.480 --> 03:04.090
If there's only two of them you simply multiply them and you divide it by the sum.

03:04.190 --> 03:09.120
So if you do that you can cross out 25 out of each one you're going to be left with three.

03:09.270 --> 03:14.260
So the equivalent resistor for those two outer branches is 50 over three.

03:14.290 --> 03:16.510
OK so now let's have a look at what we got.

03:16.510 --> 03:20.150
So now we've got a battery we've got to 75 ohm resistance.

03:20.350 --> 03:27.570
I've combined everything here in this purple circle and that's an equivalent resistance of 50 over three.

03:28.030 --> 03:31.220
And then there's also this 15 Omers distance down here.

03:31.490 --> 03:36.510
So basically all you have now is three resistors that are in series with each other.

03:36.760 --> 03:42.930
So the total equivalent resistance for this circuit at time equals to zero.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.380
Pretty straightforward.

03:44.770 --> 03:45.670
You just got to add them up.

03:45.670 --> 03:52.850
So it's 75 plus 50 over three plus 15 ohms.

03:53.260 --> 03:53.680
OK.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.420
Punch that in the calculator where do you get.

03:55.420 --> 03:58.710
One hundred six point seven.

03:58.820 --> 04:00.420
Little bit bigger than 100.

04:01.030 --> 04:02.470
So now what have we done.

04:02.470 --> 04:07.640
We've simplified this entire network into something that simply looks like this.

04:07.690 --> 04:12.910
And again we're only looking at the time equals the zero limit or very short after that time.

04:13.000 --> 04:20.170
And this is my our equivalent This here is 100 volts so guess what the current flowing through this

04:21.880 --> 04:27.310
through this section over here is the current flowing through my equivalent resistance which is basically

04:27.310 --> 04:34.770
just the voltage of the battery which is 100 divided by my equivalent resistance which is 1 0 6.7.

04:35.110 --> 04:39.480
That gives me approximately 0.9 for amps.

04:39.910 --> 04:42.300
So a correct answer for this one is choice D.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.960
And that's how you solve problems at least in this time limit.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.540
You forget about anything that's in parallel with a capacitor.

04:51.240 --> 04:55.380
And again it's only because the capacitor here doesn't have a resistance right.

04:55.380 --> 05:01.270
If there was a resistance you've got to be a bit more careful but you simply short that capacitor.

05:02.810 --> 05:07.730
If there's any resistance in parallel with it all the current is going to go through the shorted bit.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.040
None of the current is going to flow through that more resistive path.
