Hi everyone it's now time to try some problems out on our sea circuits calculating time constants calculating

00:08.490 --> 00:13.170
voltages at different times calculating the charge on the plates at different times.

00:13.380 --> 00:20.700
Energy dissipated and so forth so attached to this video you'll find the circuits problems called RC

00:20.700 --> 00:21.590
circuits.

00:21.690 --> 00:23.020
The PDAF document.

00:23.130 --> 00:24.220
Have a look at those.

00:24.240 --> 00:26.890
Think there's eight or nine problems in there.

00:26.910 --> 00:30.590
Try your best again after you're done watch the solutions.

00:30.600 --> 00:31.840
Good luck everybody.
