00:00.770 --> 00:02.650
All right here's our next example.

00:02.780 --> 00:03.650
Example five.

00:03.650 --> 00:07.750
Again it's kind of the same same circuit as the previous example.

00:07.790 --> 00:12.620
It's also in the same time limit so really after a long time Curtis exists in only one branch of the

00:12.620 --> 00:20.240
circuit at this long time if the battery here is 10 volts What's the voltage now across the 100 micro

00:20.250 --> 00:23.060
Feraud capacitor across this one over here.

00:23.630 --> 00:26.600
Well we're going to proceed using a similar approach.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.970
Now you've got to be careful you might be tempted to say 10.

00:28.970 --> 00:31.120
Remember it is 10 across this branch.

00:31.120 --> 00:33.220
It was also 10 across this capacitor.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.330
But you've got to be a little bit more careful here.

00:35.330 --> 00:41.240
So let's first start by we want to know the voltage across this capacitor Well we should probably do

00:41.240 --> 00:49.100
maybe a loop that includes this capacitor so we can do a loop around this red and let's go around in

00:49.100 --> 00:50.980
the clockwise fashion.

00:51.110 --> 00:52.770
We're going to start down here.

00:53.130 --> 00:53.870
Always doing that.

00:53.870 --> 00:55.220
I apologize.

00:55.220 --> 00:59.870
We're going to start down here at the bottom point A and again go in the clockwise direction.

00:59.870 --> 01:05.660
So the first thing I encounter is a voltage of this battery which is 10 in this case and it's right

01:05.660 --> 01:07.850
away going to rate plus 10.

01:07.850 --> 01:12.630
Now the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to encounter this twenty five ohm resistor.

01:12.860 --> 01:16.410
And for now I'm going to say that there's a current flowing through here.

01:16.520 --> 01:21.680
Now part of that current is going to continue along this branch and call this two part of the current

01:21.860 --> 01:23.870
might flow down here.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.180
One.

01:25.730 --> 01:26.040
All right.

01:26.040 --> 01:34.230
So let's go ahead and so now we get minus 525 multiplied by the current.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.240
All right.

01:35.240 --> 01:40.850
Next thing we have now is the voltage across this capacitor minus the voltage across that capacitor

01:42.050 --> 01:48.200
minus the 300 ohms multiply by the current and that branch will simplify this in a minute.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.210
It might be one step ahead of me.

01:50.570 --> 01:57.470
And then the last step over here is the voltage drop across the 100 ohm resistor and that is also has

01:57.470 --> 01:58.470
to be the current.

01:58.490 --> 02:03.140
Even though we've split it up here because of the junction here at the top it's going to then recombine

02:03.140 --> 02:08.540
at the bottom junction and you have to have the current flowing through that 100 ohm resistor.

02:08.540 --> 02:15.440
All right you go back to where I start you some all the potential differences you have to have zero.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.280
Now again the simplification comes from the long time.

02:18.410 --> 02:22.340
And if it's a long time you know that the current one must be equal to zero.

02:22.370 --> 02:26.390
So that means you could simplify this term.

02:26.480 --> 02:26.780
All right.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.100
You can combine both of those.

02:28.100 --> 02:34.670
They both have the current i basically the 5:25 and the 100 are in series with each other.

02:34.760 --> 02:41.510
So this equation over here simply gets 10 minus 625 multiplied by the current.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.160
And let me bring the voltage across that capacitor VC over here.

02:45.350 --> 02:47.890
On the other side.

02:48.140 --> 02:50.490
All right so here's our expression.

02:50.720 --> 02:56.180
So you see it's different from the previous case because now we also have a voltage drop across both

02:56.180 --> 02:58.890
of these resistors that we have to worry about.

02:59.660 --> 03:06.230
So in order to kind of solve for this what is the voltage across that capacitor you need to know what

03:06.230 --> 03:08.960
the current AI is in order to do that.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.160
Well we're going to do now is we're going to do another loop except this time we're going to go around

03:13.160 --> 03:22.220
this outside bend because basically if there is no current flowing down the center branch here that

03:22.220 --> 03:25.540
means that the current Aitu must be equal to the current.

03:25.580 --> 03:31.610
I think that is basically our junction rule applied to this junction because after a long time there

03:31.610 --> 03:33.660
is no current flowing through that branch.

03:33.830 --> 03:35.610
So you have to have this requirement.

03:35.660 --> 03:42.680
So basically all we have out here is a one big loop and it's one circuit where all the three resistors

03:42.680 --> 03:45.280
are essentially in series with each other.

03:45.800 --> 03:46.450
OK.

03:46.610 --> 03:52.910
So all you have to do now is just do another loop and calculate what that current is.

03:52.910 --> 03:56.410
So let me do that one over here the first thing I encounter is that battery.

03:56.900 --> 04:04.560
Next thing I encounter again I'm going to have this minus 525 multiplied by the current I minus the

04:04.800 --> 04:13.070
1500 ohm resistor multiplied by the current of the voltage drop across here and then minus 100 times

04:13.070 --> 04:13.550
the current.

04:13.550 --> 04:19.940
I said that if I eventually go back to point A that there must be equal to zero.

04:20.370 --> 04:20.850
OK.

04:21.080 --> 04:30.200
So the current I can calculate now simply 10 divided by 525 basically the equivalent resistance of these

04:30.200 --> 04:32.750
three in series with each other.

04:33.010 --> 04:41.570
If the 100 plus 100 or so substitute that in the calculator are what you should get is 4.7 times tend

04:41.570 --> 04:45.140
of the negative 3 amps.

04:45.140 --> 04:52.940
Now you go back and you substitute that into this equation over here so you get 10 minus 625 multiplied

04:52.940 --> 04:53.540
by the current.

04:53.540 --> 04:58.130
Now which I know 4.7 times ten to the minus three.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.030
That gives me the voltage across my capacitor.

05:01.220 --> 05:05.620
So it has to be less than 10 and we could really got rid of that choice right away.

05:05.850 --> 05:10.970
So the voltage across the capacitor is just substituting in the calculator now and he should get something

05:10.970 --> 05:18.080
like 7.0 or six volts go so a correct answer for this one here is choice D.

05:18.190 --> 05:22.520
And now when you get from a little bit of circuit analysis again and using the fact that we know in

05:22.530 --> 05:29.090
the long time limit that the outside branch and this middle branch here can't have any current flowing

05:29.090 --> 05:32.020
through it can have a good problem.

05:32.020 --> 05:36.330
Hopefully you've got that one start kind of understanding how to deal with these types of problems.

05:36.340 --> 05:36.520
Now.
