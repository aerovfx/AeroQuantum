00:00.130 --> 00:05.910
All right here is example seven entitled energy dissipated or in this example says the switch in the

00:05.910 --> 00:08.470
circuit below is in position A.

00:08.490 --> 00:13.110
So if it's in position it's really only this first part of the circuit here at the beginning and it's

00:13.110 --> 00:14.730
there for a long time.

00:14.890 --> 00:20.610
OK the switches then move to position B but only for a second and then it's return back to position

00:20.670 --> 00:21.380
A.

00:21.660 --> 00:26.500
So while the switch is in position B how much energy is dissipated here in this.

00:26.580 --> 00:28.990
Fifty five hundred ohm resistor.

00:28.990 --> 00:29.220
All right.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.290
So let's have a look at this problem.

00:30.290 --> 00:35.280
So the first thing we got to notice is its first in position A for a long time.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.040
Well what does that mean.

00:37.110 --> 00:41.760
That means that after a long time there's going to be no more current in this section because there's

00:41.790 --> 00:44.910
a single branch and there is a capacitor.

00:45.040 --> 00:50.550
There's no more current After a while because the capacitor the voltage across the capacitor ends up

00:50.550 --> 00:52.880
being 50 volts.

00:52.890 --> 00:55.840
Once you achieve that you're done charging the capacitor.

00:55.980 --> 01:04.830
So we know that after a long time I have 50 volts across this capacitor which has a value of 200 micro

01:04.840 --> 01:06.270
Fred.

01:07.110 --> 01:07.440
All right.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.640
So we actually can also calculate how much charge there is but doesn't really matter for now.

01:11.780 --> 01:12.380
OK.

01:12.580 --> 01:19.320
So what we've done now is we've stored potential energy in this capacitor the potential energy stored

01:19.320 --> 01:20.730
in the capacitor initially

01:23.420 --> 01:24.410
it's going to be what.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.210
Well let's call it you.

01:26.630 --> 01:30.520
Now there is you can read it as this is cue times V.

01:30.750 --> 01:35.760
I kind of like the other formula again and you can manipulate this kind of three ways to write this.

01:35.810 --> 01:39.740
I kind of like to write it like this because I know what the value of the capacitance is.

01:39.740 --> 01:42.150
I know what the voltage across the plates.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.720
Therefore I can calculate this.

01:43.720 --> 01:52.990
This is a 1 1/2 C would be 200 times tend to the minus 6 and then the voltage is 50.

01:52.990 --> 01:54.580
Don't forget the square.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.040
So you calculate this and you get zero point two five Joule.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.370
That's how much energy you stored in this capacitor.

02:03.380 --> 02:04.240
So now what happens.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.720
Well now you're going to flip the switch so you fully charged this capacitor.

02:08.750 --> 02:12.800
You've put a whole bunch of charge you put a voltage on it and now I'm going to switch into position

02:12.800 --> 02:13.450
B.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.340
Now once it's in position B guess what happens.

02:16.910 --> 02:19.480
It's going to start to discharge.

02:19.580 --> 02:24.830
However I'm not going to let it fully discharge I'm not going to let all of this energy dissipated because

02:24.830 --> 02:27.600
I'm only doing this for one second.

02:28.220 --> 02:33.560
So what we really have to do of this problem is calculate what is really the final voltage after one

02:33.560 --> 02:35.420
second.

02:35.630 --> 02:38.320
All you have to remember here is that you are discharging.

02:38.330 --> 02:45.290
So let's calculate what the final voltages across and then we can also look at the final potential energy.

02:45.740 --> 02:53.330
So the final voltage or the voltage after and any time is given by some initial voltage which is 50

02:53.330 --> 02:54.310
in this case.

02:54.440 --> 03:02.600
And again it's exponentially decaying function minus T divided by my time constant which is our c time

03:02.600 --> 03:04.190
constant for this cases.

03:04.280 --> 03:11.720
Pretty straightforward 200 micro Feraud multiplied by 50 volts and the time.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.020
Now the time is going to be one second.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.020
That's also pretty straightforward.

03:16.310 --> 03:18.200
OK so let's substitute everything in here.

03:18.230 --> 03:25.520
So we get 50 volts exponential of minus 1 divided by the value of the resistance.

03:25.520 --> 03:30.450
Now look at it's fifty five hundred fifty five hundred.

03:30.650 --> 03:38.380
Multiplied by the value of the capacitance 200 times ten to the minus 6.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.660
That's the RC time constant.

03:40.660 --> 03:44.750
Substitute everything into my equation here.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.820
Actually really what we're finding here is the voltage at time equals to 1 second.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.220
We've substituted one into that equation.

03:52.570 --> 03:52.820
All right.

03:52.840 --> 04:00.280
So that gives me a voltage of approximately twenty point one volts.

04:00.430 --> 04:02.470
That's the voltage at one second.

04:02.470 --> 04:06.740
So that means how much potential energy is stored in this capacitor here.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.310
After that time equals the 1 second.

04:09.310 --> 04:15.030
So over here you simply have to look at the final potential energy was one half multiplied by the capacitance

04:15.040 --> 04:20.730
that hasn't change and it's whatever the final voltages across the plates.

04:20.740 --> 04:27.490
So in this case it's the one half multiplied by two hundred times ten to the minus 6 and multiplied

04:27.490 --> 04:34.670
by twenty point one and square that value which you get here zero point zero for as you will.

04:34.690 --> 04:36.310
That's my final potential energy.

04:36.310 --> 04:43.210
I started out with Point two five and now I've only got point zero for what what does that mean.

04:43.220 --> 04:47.910
That means that some of that energy was dissipated and the energy dissipated.

04:47.910 --> 04:48.500
Where did it go.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.600
Well it actually was dissipated into heat through this resistor.

04:53.110 --> 04:54.440
So the energy dissipated

04:57.590 --> 05:06.260
you simply take the difference between my initial energy dissipated and try that again is simply going

05:06.260 --> 05:10.700
to be 0.25 minus zero point zero four.

05:11.170 --> 05:15.420
So most of that energy was dissipated through that resistor.

05:15.800 --> 05:20.150
So that's how much energy is dissipated in a resistor that's kind of I think the easiest way to solve

05:20.150 --> 05:21.340
this problem.

05:21.740 --> 05:23.290
It's pretty straightforward.

05:23.450 --> 05:29.330
Calculate the initial potential energy calculate the final potential energy that energy had to go somewhere.

05:29.510 --> 05:30.250
It was dissipated.
