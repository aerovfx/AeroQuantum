00:00.210 --> 00:04.740
All right for resistors in parallel It's a little bit more complicated than one in series but not too

00:04.740 --> 00:05.560
bad.

00:05.580 --> 00:10.450
So here's a case where I have two resistance are one and are two in parallel with each other.

00:10.530 --> 00:14.990
They're in parallel because they're on different branches right different wires.

00:15.090 --> 00:20.660
And the goal here is to replace both of them by one equivalent resistance so between points A and B

00:21.600 --> 00:25.800
regardless of how many I would have I can replace that by one equivalent resistor.

00:25.950 --> 00:29.020
I'm going to call that our equivalent.

00:29.250 --> 00:30.310
And the reason you want to do that.

00:30.330 --> 00:36.270
Well if you want to apply Ohm's law to this simple one resistor circuit one that's very very easy.

00:36.480 --> 00:36.680
Right.

00:36.690 --> 00:43.090
Because if I call the potential at point A vitæ I call the potential at point B B.

00:43.260 --> 00:48.150
I know that V-A has to be bigger than VB because current always flows from the higher potential toward

00:48.150 --> 00:50.520
the lower potential.

00:50.550 --> 00:58.590
So in this case you'd simply have V.A minus VB just for shorthand let's just call that V and that there

00:58.590 --> 01:03.250
must be equal to our equivalent multiplied by the current.

01:03.270 --> 01:07.190
I so that would be my expression.

01:07.810 --> 01:11.110
So now let's go back and look at the top figure.

01:11.110 --> 01:12.520
So in this figure over here if you look at.

01:12.520 --> 01:17.560
Now I've got a current flowing into this point this is called the junction because you have one wire

01:17.560 --> 01:23.440
going in and this kind of two going out the potential at point A is still labeled vitæ the potential

01:23.440 --> 01:25.730
I'd be here still labeled VB.

01:26.200 --> 01:31.090
Since current is flowing from the left to the right you know that this side here has to be at a higher

01:31.090 --> 01:33.730
potential in that side.

01:33.860 --> 01:37.070
However now look what happens you have a current flowing in here.

01:37.160 --> 01:41.840
Now part of that current is going to flow in the top resistor part of the current.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.460
Now it's going to split and go into the bottom resistor or two.

01:46.130 --> 01:52.070
However whatever current flows in whatever charge flows in every second has to be equal to the total

01:52.070 --> 01:54.330
amount of charge that leaves every second.

01:54.830 --> 02:00.400
So you have to have this current equation here because you have to have charge that's conserved.

02:01.710 --> 02:04.260
All right so this is an important expression.

02:04.410 --> 02:05.300
So the next thing now.

02:05.310 --> 02:09.870
Well let's imagine we wanted to apply ohms law to this how do we actually do it.

02:10.410 --> 02:13.220
Well for this case there's kind of two ways you can do it.

02:13.500 --> 02:18.900
I could start at point A and I can either go to point B by going at the top or I can go through the

02:18.900 --> 02:20.070
bottom branch.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.040
So let's go in through the top branch.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.210
What would it look like.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.900
Well again you'd have V.A minus VB.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.490
That's the potential difference that must be equal to Ohm's law.

02:32.550 --> 02:32.760
Right.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.750
That's ohms law.

02:34.080 --> 02:41.870
So that must be equal to either one R1 and for simplicity or remember we called V-A mine is VB let's

02:41.870 --> 02:44.620
just call that V.

02:44.670 --> 02:44.890
All right.

02:44.890 --> 02:52.330
What about now if we go through the bottom range we go to the bottom branch again it's v minus VB.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.080
That's the same for both top and bottom.

02:56.190 --> 02:56.840
And now what.

02:56.850 --> 03:03.450
One now we have a different current We have Aitu going through the bottom are two that must also be

03:03.450 --> 03:06.060
equal to V R.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.050
Now one last step.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.830
We're going to do now that we're going to use both of these equations.

03:09.890 --> 03:18.220
Our top equation and the bottom one over here and we're going to use it to simplify this equation that

03:18.220 --> 03:23.210
we had for the conservation of the current.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.550
So let's go ahead and do that.

03:24.550 --> 03:29.890
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to eliminate expression for I want an eye to using these equations

03:29.890 --> 03:31.740
here in the red boxes.

03:32.050 --> 03:37.330
So instead of writing I one let's just keep the total current flowing in to be like that instead of

03:37.330 --> 03:44.250
writing I one I'm going to replace one with V over our one.

03:44.270 --> 03:45.200
All right good.

03:45.350 --> 03:52.980
Next thing instead of writing I to I'm going to replace that by vi over our two.

03:52.990 --> 03:53.260
All right.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.240
Now the last step I can do here.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.490
I notice that I have a V for both terms.

03:57.610 --> 03:58.910
We can factor that out.

04:00.470 --> 04:08.450
We can call that one over our one plus one over our two multiplied by V.

04:08.450 --> 04:11.870
Now it's started to look a lot like my equation down over here.

04:11.870 --> 04:15.140
Let's give this equation here in the blue box.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.840
It has a different form because my eye is alone.

04:19.850 --> 04:23.600
However what if I called everything in this bracket over here.

04:24.100 --> 04:31.410
What if I called everything in this bracket one divided by are equivalent.

04:31.630 --> 04:32.800
What would it look like.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.260
I would simply look like this.

04:36.260 --> 04:42.180
It would look like one over our equivalent multiplied by V.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.280
And now if you rearrange the equation what are you going to find.

04:47.290 --> 04:53.890
You're going to find that V equals are equivalent multiplied by and you're going to get the exact same

04:53.890 --> 04:54.920
equation.

04:54.970 --> 04:57.410
So we'll bring our equivalent on the other side.

04:57.780 --> 05:03.810
All right you get v equals 2 are equivalent times the current.

05:03.850 --> 05:05.650
So that's an important equation actually.

05:05.740 --> 05:06.910
So look what we have.

05:06.910 --> 05:08.540
So our equivalent resistance.

05:08.560 --> 05:18.700
Now you can simply write like this one over our equivalent is equal to 1 over our one plus one over

05:18.700 --> 05:20.540
our two.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.120
And that's the equation for the equivalent resistance.

05:24.290 --> 05:32.210
If I have two resistors in parallel with each other kind of an important equation OK.

05:32.690 --> 05:34.100
So this is another one you're going to have to know.
