All right one last thing I wanted to comment on for combinations of series and parallel let's just recall

00:06.210 --> 00:14.760
that for combinations and series to get the equivalent You simply have to add up each individual resistor.

00:14.940 --> 00:25.570
And if they're in parallel it's 1 over are equivalent and then you add up the reciprocal of the terms.

00:25.840 --> 00:30.630
OK and this works fine as long as they're in series and in parallel.

00:30.640 --> 00:36.880
Now all those circuits that I've shown you so far all the different networks we were able to kind of

00:36.880 --> 00:41.080
reduce them into combinations of series or parallel resistors.

00:41.080 --> 00:47.410
However one thing I want you guys to be very very careful of is there are many circuits where these

00:47.410 --> 00:54.310
tricks don't work because you can't clearly identify whether or not they're in series or in parallel.

00:54.460 --> 00:57.980
And I'm going to illustrate it with this simple case over here.

00:58.150 --> 01:01.170
Kind of a simple network there's only five resistors.

01:01.660 --> 01:10.000
However if you look at them imagine we look at this forum resistor so points A and B are over here and

01:10.000 --> 01:15.500
imagine the question was well find the equivalent resistance between points AB.

01:15.850 --> 01:20.360
So we'd want to try to use some of our rules that we know work.

01:20.360 --> 01:27.520
However Majel we try to group this forum resistor and while you would say well this forum resistor is

01:27.520 --> 01:32.650
actually not in series with this forum resistor because there's another resistor here that kind of breaks

01:32.650 --> 01:33.360
it up.

01:33.370 --> 01:38.550
Remember the rule for them to be in series was you have to have the same current but I imagine there

01:38.550 --> 01:41.960
is current flowing down here well some of it might go through here.

01:42.190 --> 01:43.900
Some of it might continue down here.

01:43.900 --> 01:44.830
We don't know.

01:46.050 --> 01:50.280
All right so you can't say that both of these foreign resistors are in series.

01:50.880 --> 01:56.880
Now you might be tempted to say well this forum resisted and might be in parallel with this guy.

01:57.000 --> 02:05.050
This 3.1 to 5 ohm resistor and again that's not really true because we run into a problem when you have

02:05.050 --> 02:06.790
this resistor in the mix.

02:06.790 --> 02:12.250
If this resistor wasn't there then you'd be able to do a lot of simpler simpler simplifications to the

02:12.250 --> 02:13.000
circuit.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.220
But it is here and this complicates the matter.

02:16.240 --> 02:20.550
There are also a lot of circuits that you're going to see that involve multiple power supplies.

02:20.710 --> 02:27.220
And in those cases also you won't be able to use these tools over here on the right on the left hand

02:27.220 --> 02:30.350
side in order to simplify our circuit.

02:30.340 --> 02:34.870
So don't worry about it there are going to be other methods that we can use in order to solve these

02:34.870 --> 02:37.500
circuits and that's all we're going to see in the next section.

02:37.570 --> 02:40.000
But these techniques don't always work.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.510
So just be on the lookout for them for some of those circuits.

02:43.540 --> 02:44.130
OK.
