00:00.620 --> 00:03.650
All right let's have a look at this example it's a much more complicated circuit.

00:03.650 --> 00:09.860
We have one power supply and I have seven resistors and the goal now is going to be to simplify the

00:09.860 --> 00:18.110
circuit so I could simply represent it like this the same 5 volt power supply and I'm going to combine

00:18.170 --> 00:27.550
everything and write it all in terms of one single equivalent resistor and the purpose now is going

00:27.550 --> 00:31.870
to be to find what is the value of the equivalent resistor.

00:32.140 --> 00:36.390
Let's call this simply our equivalent and that's it.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.540
Let's find what the value is.

00:37.540 --> 00:42.000
So I have the individual values of each resistor here in my network.

00:42.010 --> 00:46.090
Now we're going to apply the tools that we learned in order to find what the value of the equivalent

00:46.090 --> 00:47.320
resistor is.

00:47.320 --> 00:52.060
Because once you have a simple circuit like this you can immediately apply Ohm's law and find how much

00:52.060 --> 00:56.140
current is actually flowing through the battery.

00:56.140 --> 00:56.470
All right.

00:56.470 --> 01:03.610
So in order to simplify this network kind of first sit back and just look at it a little bit and before

01:03.610 --> 01:10.330
using any of the rules well start simplifying things that are kind of jump straight out at me for example

01:10.840 --> 01:15.990
are six and seven I know are along the same branch.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.730
Right whatever current flows through R6 has to be the same current that flows through R7.

01:23.090 --> 01:23.550
Right.

01:23.590 --> 01:28.570
So this here must be a series combination.

01:28.810 --> 01:30.690
So both of those must be in series

01:33.250 --> 01:36.420
another series combination that you should be able to see.

01:36.520 --> 01:43.630
Is this one over here are two and are three whatever current flows through are two has to be the same

01:43.630 --> 01:45.900
current that flows through three.

01:46.210 --> 01:47.690
It has nowhere else to go.

01:49.220 --> 01:55.910
Now other currents are not quite that straight forward whatever current flows through our four not necessarily

01:55.910 --> 01:59.450
the same as the current flowing through our fiber through the other branches.

01:59.540 --> 02:02.060
And you could say that for any other combination.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.640
Okay.

02:03.650 --> 02:08.640
So we have two series combinations both of those.

02:08.690 --> 02:11.130
So let's start by simplifying those.

02:11.690 --> 02:17.090
So what I'm going to do first is I'm going to combine our two and our three and if you remember the

02:17.090 --> 02:22.670
series combination for our two and our three if they're in series all you do is you basically add them

02:22.670 --> 02:23.880
up.

02:24.230 --> 02:34.690
So we're going to call this our equivalent one is going to be our two plus our three R2 is four owns

02:34.690 --> 02:40.640
our three is 8 4 plus 8 equals the 12

02:43.740 --> 02:51.140
are equivalent to these I'm going to call our equivalent to the equivalent resistance of our 6 and our

02:51.160 --> 02:52.000
7.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.180
Both of those are in series with each other.

02:54.460 --> 03:03.390
So it's simply our 6 plus R7 which gives me 2 plus 2.

03:03.490 --> 03:08.520
So this is equivalent to a 4 ohm resistor.

03:08.550 --> 03:08.780
All right.

03:08.790 --> 03:09.220
Great.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.250
So let's put that on the diagram and clean this up a little bit.

03:15.540 --> 03:15.900
All right.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.470
So here we've got this is a 4 ohm.

03:19.470 --> 03:23.820
This here is a 12 ohm equivalent resistance.

03:23.820 --> 03:24.120
OK.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.400
Now what can I do.

03:25.830 --> 03:35.140
Well now I would now start looking at probably try to combine our five and a four Omers this.

03:35.710 --> 03:45.050
Now if I look at it let's put everything in a in a bubble over here I have our five which is four ohms

03:45.560 --> 03:52.200
which is now in parallel with basically another 4 ohm resistor because I've combined our six and our

03:52.200 --> 03:55.600
seven now they're represented by this 400 resistor.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.920
So this is what it looks like on the outside.

03:58.940 --> 04:00.720
So those are ones I can combine.

04:01.220 --> 04:08.180
So the combination of our five and the four all McQuivey resistance that I called are equivalent to

04:09.520 --> 04:11.400
will give me an equivalent resistance.

04:11.450 --> 04:11.990
OK.

04:12.260 --> 04:19.650
So let's call that our equivalent three are equivalent three is again this are.

04:19.670 --> 04:22.790
These are going to be two resistors that are in parallel with each other.

04:22.820 --> 04:28.500
So what you have to do is you multiply them and divided by the sum you get four times for divided by

04:28.530 --> 04:34.910
eight that's 16 over eight which gives me 2 ohms.

04:35.550 --> 04:43.380
So this everything in this outer box now is basically the equivalent of a two Omers is that combined

04:43.380 --> 04:47.870
these these three resistors here are combined into a two arm resistor.

04:50.370 --> 04:53.330
So let's just make that clear in our diagram over here.

04:57.100 --> 04:57.900
OK.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.030
So now what else can I simplify.

05:00.130 --> 05:06.490
Well once you have that well now look what you can do with this 10 I have are four which is a 10 ohm

05:06.490 --> 05:11.970
resistor which is now going to be connected to a single resistance right.

05:11.980 --> 05:16.200
All of these three combine into a 2 ohm resistor.

05:16.570 --> 05:24.600
So what you have now is 10 which is in series with a 2 ohm resistor so you can then combine this 10

05:24.600 --> 05:26.800
with the next one with the two.

05:27.630 --> 05:31.180
So if you draw the circuit at this point this is what it's going to look like.

05:32.430 --> 05:34.730
So do an intermediate step here.

05:35.140 --> 05:35.980
You have five

05:39.460 --> 05:42.680
we have our fourth resistor are one.

05:42.770 --> 05:43.800
What else.

05:43.850 --> 05:49.730
I had already combined both of those in this first branch.

05:49.800 --> 05:57.760
This gives me 12 and then I had what I had 10.

05:57.970 --> 05:59.910
This was the resistance are four.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.630
And now I've combined everything in this outer branch to give me an equivalent resistance of two

06:10.080 --> 06:10.560
OK.

06:10.650 --> 06:14.560
Now this should be pretty straightforward.

06:14.730 --> 06:17.490
You should be able to combine the 10 and the two right away.

06:17.490 --> 06:21.920
Now be careful these resistors here are in series with each other.

06:21.950 --> 06:27.340
There is only a single branch that's connecting them.

06:27.400 --> 06:34.890
So let's do one more equivalent resistance we can do is you can combine both of those

06:38.430 --> 06:42.570
equivalent resistance of everything here.

06:42.570 --> 06:49.030
Or are we now are equivalent for a lot of different steps here but that's it.

06:49.040 --> 06:56.520
This is simply going to be the resistance are four plus my are equivalent three.

06:56.740 --> 07:07.950
So this gives me 10 ohms plus two ohms so at the end that whole branch gives me 12 ohms OK.

07:09.170 --> 07:16.140
So the next step you have a 12 ahome resistance.

07:16.200 --> 07:24.670
This guy over here that is in parallel with a 12 ohm resistance.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.440
So what can you do.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.040
You can combine both of those.

07:27.060 --> 07:27.760
Right.

07:28.300 --> 07:30.580
So now we should have our equivalent five

07:38.920 --> 07:41.600
again multiply them and divide by the sum.

07:41.710 --> 07:48.010
In this case the numbers are getting big so gets a little bit trickier but 12 by 12 and divided by the

07:48.010 --> 07:51.100
sum 12 plus 12.

07:51.410 --> 07:57.960
And what you can do here is just simply factor out a 12 if you factor out a 12.

07:58.140 --> 08:07.740
You're going to be left with one plus one which gives me two at the end 12 divided by two gives me 6

08:07.740 --> 08:09.820
ohms.

08:10.410 --> 08:17.410
So everything now in the blue is equivalent to a 6 ohm resistor.

08:19.510 --> 08:21.280
So one last step.

08:21.730 --> 08:27.070
How can I combine this forum resistor with everything here in the box.

08:27.070 --> 08:29.850
Everything in blue is represented by 6 ohm resistor.

08:30.010 --> 08:36.010
You simply have to add them up in series with one another.

08:36.150 --> 08:39.500
So the last step you get is our equivalent.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.560
We're up to six.

08:41.700 --> 08:48.450
Gives me four ohms which is our one plus our equivalent five

08:51.710 --> 09:00.710
so four plus six gives me ten ohms so all of that so we can simplify our network in terms of a 10 ohm

09:00.710 --> 09:02.750
resistor.

09:03.140 --> 09:11.000
So that would automatically mean if I apply Ohm's law to this circuit ohms law equals to our set my

09:11.000 --> 09:17.540
equivalent resistance now is our equivalent multiplied by the current you'd automatically be able to

09:17.540 --> 09:24.110
show that the current now is simply 5 over 10 which gives me half an amp

09:27.550 --> 09:36.100
so tells me there is half an amp flowing through the battery that's the current flowing in the circuit

09:37.170 --> 09:40.220
that's actually going to be the same current flowing through here.

09:40.570 --> 09:45.760
It's actually the same current flowing through the resistance are one it has to be the same current

09:45.790 --> 09:48.340
everywhere in this branch.

09:48.430 --> 09:51.050
There can't be any other current.

09:51.070 --> 09:54.180
Now once you get to this point now it's going to be different.

09:54.350 --> 09:59.020
But using the equivalent resistance really is the simplest way to get the amount of current that flows

09:59.020 --> 10:00.030
through the battery.

10:00.190 --> 10:04.840
And also the going to be the same current flowing through any resistor that is in series with the battery.
