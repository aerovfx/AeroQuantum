00:00.510 --> 00:00.870
All right.

00:00.900 --> 00:06.510
So we just saw if we have two resistors in parallel you should be able to write one over our equivalent

00:07.020 --> 00:12.780
is one over our one plus one over our two and this is fine and dandy but I find this is a little bit

00:12.780 --> 00:14.660
long so here's a little trick right.

00:14.670 --> 00:18.790
If you only have two and let's just be clear that you have to have two.

00:18.840 --> 00:19.290
OK.

00:19.290 --> 00:22.840
Doesn't work for three or four but you can always do two at a time.

00:23.070 --> 00:26.580
So if you have two resistors in parallel you can use this equation it's fine and then you're going to

00:26.580 --> 00:27.710
get the right answer.

00:27.870 --> 00:30.390
However there's a better way to do this.

00:30.540 --> 00:35.870
And the trick is Let's first put them on a common denominator so it put them on a common denominator

00:35.880 --> 00:42.090
that would be our one multiplied by our two in order to do that.

00:42.090 --> 00:47.740
I'd have to multiply this side by our two and I'd have to multiply this side by our.

00:47.740 --> 00:49.850
Now this is the exact same expression.

00:49.890 --> 00:51.350
This is one over our equivalent.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.310
Hopefully you could see that now at the end really what I want to get is are equivalent I don't want

00:56.310 --> 01:00.000
to know one over are equivalent that doesn't get me anywhere.

01:00.030 --> 01:02.110
So you have to do now is just flip these.

01:02.110 --> 01:12.800
So are equivalent if there's only two resistors is are one are two divided by are one plus are two.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.230
So what does that mean that are equivalent.

01:16.230 --> 01:18.630
If there's two multiply

01:22.290 --> 01:24.920
with this term are 1 multiplied by are two.

01:25.240 --> 01:28.510
And the other one some.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.490
So that's all you need to do.

01:31.690 --> 01:36.480
If you have two resistors in parallel with each other you want to know what the equivalent resistance

01:36.480 --> 01:38.070
is down here.

01:38.830 --> 01:42.100
All you need to do is you multiply them and divided by the sum.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.540
So let's take an example.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.930
Imagine you have five and five right.

01:45.940 --> 01:52.000
Take a simple example five ohm resistor is in parallel with a five Omers ister the equivalent resistance

01:52.010 --> 01:58.870
in this case where you could do this one over five plus one over five equals one over are equivalent.

01:58.880 --> 02:04.340
Way too slow in this case you simply multiply them five times five.

02:04.520 --> 02:09.020
Multiply divided by the sum of the sum is 10.

02:09.350 --> 02:12.490
You get 25 over 10.

02:12.560 --> 02:20.970
You can take out five from each get five over two which gives you 2.5 ohms or if you add another example

02:20.970 --> 02:23.620
what if you had six and three.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.230
What would be our equivalent in that case.

02:26.850 --> 02:29.620
Well they are equivalents and there's only two I can use the trick.

02:29.640 --> 02:33.050
You can multiply them that's 18 divided by the sum.

02:33.180 --> 02:36.020
I add them up six plus three gives me nine.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.100
This is equivalent to a 2 ohm resistor.

02:39.940 --> 02:44.970
All right on more what if you had 10 and 20.

02:45.170 --> 02:48.540
Would that give you more are equivalent in this case.

02:48.550 --> 02:58.910
Very very easy to multiply them it's 200 divided by the sum 30 gives me 20 over 3 ohms.

02:59.510 --> 03:00.130
OK.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.880
So whenever you have two resistors and pair of Al there's a simple little trick.

03:03.890 --> 03:05.370
Multiply them divided by the sum.
