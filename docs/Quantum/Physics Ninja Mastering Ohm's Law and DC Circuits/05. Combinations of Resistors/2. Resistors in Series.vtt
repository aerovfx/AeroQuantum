All right we're first going to start off with resistors in series.

00:03.450 --> 00:05.780
So let's consider the case here on the laugh.

00:05.850 --> 00:10.710
So I've got I've labeled three points A B and C there are just points that are located on wires connecting

00:10.710 --> 00:17.820
two different resistors are one are two I have labeled the current I and the first thing to notice about

00:17.820 --> 00:25.770
resistors in series is if there is a current flowing through this wire it has to flow through the resistance

00:25.790 --> 00:26.510
are.

00:26.700 --> 00:32.320
It's going to go through point B and then it's going to flow through resistance are two through Point

00:32.320 --> 00:36.280
C the current AI is going to be the same everywhere.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.600
And that's very important.

00:38.610 --> 00:47.100
If the current flows down everywhere it means that on this side of the resistance remember current always

00:47.100 --> 00:53.790
flows the positive current always flows from the higher potential toward the lower electrical potential.

00:53.790 --> 00:59.310
So that means at this point a is at a higher potential than this side.

00:59.400 --> 01:06.240
It also means that the potential at this point is higher than the potential at that point.

01:06.270 --> 01:11.100
So actually if I go through and I label the potential at three different points at a it might have some

01:11.100 --> 01:19.330
voltage a at point B you might have some voltage B and at point C have some voltage C.

01:19.710 --> 01:26.070
Now the voltage difference between points A and points B could write it like this.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.770
V A mine is VB.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.480
Sometimes you would simply call that V.

01:30.510 --> 01:30.750
Right.

01:30.750 --> 01:36.600
The potential difference between both of those points that is given by Ohm's law in ohms law remember

01:36.600 --> 01:42.180
what it said the voltage drop across a resistor is equal to the value of the resistance.

01:42.330 --> 01:46.680
In this case it's R1 multiplied by the current flowing through it.

01:46.920 --> 01:53.800
That's simply the current I can do the same thing now for the voltage drop across the next.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.090
There are two.

01:55.260 --> 02:01.650
Now I'm comparing points B and point C and I know that point B is at a higher electrical potential than

02:01.650 --> 02:02.520
point C.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.270
So let me write it like this.

02:04.390 --> 02:06.620
VB mine is visi.

02:06.620 --> 02:12.340
I know I'm going to get a positive number here because current is flowing from left to right.

02:12.450 --> 02:18.550
In this case the ohms law applied to this resistor over here is the value of the resistance are two.

02:18.990 --> 02:22.940
And it's the same current same current flowing through it.

02:23.520 --> 02:29.310
So if I call this equation 1 and call this equation to or what if I wanted to know what is the voltage

02:29.310 --> 02:39.120
difference between point A and Point C Well what you could do is we can actually add both of these equations.

02:39.140 --> 02:41.730
Look what happens if I add both of those equations.

02:41.780 --> 02:43.270
What am I going to get.

02:43.340 --> 02:47.910
I'm going to get vitÃ¦ because there's no other V.A term in the second equation.

02:47.930 --> 02:50.120
Look what happens to the VB terms.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.000
I have negative VB over here and I have VB right here.

02:54.170 --> 03:00.460
Those are actually going to cancel out and then I'm going to be left with mine as VC.

03:01.050 --> 03:01.880
Look with that gives me.

03:01.880 --> 03:07.410
That is simply the potential difference between point A and Point Z at the end.

03:07.410 --> 03:14.960
Now if I add both of these terms now on the right hand side look what I get are 1 multiplied by the

03:14.960 --> 03:19.130
current plus are two multiplied by the current.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.150
Well this equation.

03:21.350 --> 03:22.270
Look what I can do to it.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.880
I can factor out the current.

03:24.880 --> 03:33.950
I this is simply R1 Plus are two multiplied by the current.

03:34.190 --> 03:36.470
Now the term in the bracket is important over here.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.090
It tells me that if I want to know the potential difference between points A and Point see Actually

03:43.090 --> 03:51.950
I can replace both of these resistors here by 1 equivalent resistor an equivalent resistor if two of

03:51.950 --> 03:56.560
them are in series like this is simply the algebraic sum.

03:56.660 --> 03:59.150
So that is our equation over here.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.890
So my equivalent resistor when I have two resistors in series you simply add them up.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.560
Very very simple.

04:06.560 --> 04:15.270
So if this is a forum resistor this here is a 6 ohm resistor my equivalent resistor is simply 10 homes.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.520
I'm done.

04:16.520 --> 04:22.520
I can simplify my network and simply replace it by 1 equivalent resistance equals the 10 ohm and then

04:22.610 --> 04:25.120
try to solve the problem.

04:25.130 --> 04:27.700
Now the other important thing is that the current I.

04:27.890 --> 04:31.590
It's the same current flowing through my equivalent resistor.

04:31.730 --> 04:36.770
It has to be the same current flowing through the forum resistor through the six ohm resistor and now

04:36.770 --> 04:40.130
through the equivalent 10 ohm resistor.

04:40.130 --> 04:44.240
So that is our rule number one the equivalent resistance.

04:44.240 --> 04:48.760
If I have two of them in series with each other you simply add them up.

04:49.430 --> 04:55.200
Well what would happen if I had 10 of them or 20 of them in series with each other.

04:55.310 --> 05:02.350
So the more general formula now is if I have several of them that are in series with each other you

05:02.350 --> 05:09.510
would just use the same arguments except all you do now is you simply add them up you add up all the

05:09.510 --> 05:15.480
individual resistors that are in series with each other and then you come up with a number.

05:15.600 --> 05:21.010
So there's some here can go from one to whatever number of resistors you have in series.

05:21.390 --> 05:22.790
In this case I only have two.

05:22.950 --> 05:28.380
So I only have two terms over here but if I'd have five of them then my sum would go from I equals the

05:28.380 --> 05:31.860
1 to 5 and I'd add up all the individual values.

05:33.340 --> 05:36.400
So resistors in series are pretty straightforward.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.420
Simply add them up.
