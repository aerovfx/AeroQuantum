WEBVTT

00:00.480 --> 00:05.280
All right here's a very complicated looking sample here it says find the equivalent resistance.

00:05.280 --> 00:10.760
We have a whole series of resistors in this network and now we're asked to find the equivalent resistance.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.790
How do you deal with a problem like this.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.860
And I wanted to include this problem here just to highlight one important thing that you're able to

00:16.860 --> 00:23.250
do and show you a trick if it does look very complicated like this one does what you're allowed to do

00:23.250 --> 00:28.020
and all of these cases since these wires are ideal wires and we always assume that the wires don't have

00:28.050 --> 00:29.960
any resistance themselves.

00:30.030 --> 00:35.490
You're allowed to reshape this into something that looks more familiar to you especially like these

00:35.490 --> 00:40.200
diagonal resistors you know when you first start looking at these it might look like this is more complicated

00:40.200 --> 00:46.080
than it should be but you can just reshape it to make it look more kind of Cartesian like and let me

00:46.080 --> 00:47.610
illustrate what I mean by that.

00:47.850 --> 00:54.630
So to reshape it actually I'm only going to consider these five resistors here at the end so let me

00:54.630 --> 00:58.280
highlight that region and we're going to show you how you can redraw it.

00:58.410 --> 01:01.600
So let's only consider our 6.

01:01.890 --> 01:04.760
And let me just say this whole area here.

01:04.860 --> 01:07.040
So this is the area I want to consider.

01:07.470 --> 01:11.700
Let me show you how you can just redraw this and make it look like something you're more familiar with

01:12.250 --> 01:12.660
it.

01:12.840 --> 01:13.810
So.

01:14.860 --> 01:15.220
OK.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.140
So how would I do this.

01:16.140 --> 01:22.270
Well what I would first start with is if I notice that are 8 and are 10.

01:22.440 --> 01:30.320
Both of those resistors up here those are in series with one another are 8 and 10 have to be in series

01:30.330 --> 01:35.730
because if your current flowing through are 8 you automatically have to flow through the resistance

01:35.760 --> 01:38.150
are 10 OK.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.630
So I would maybe start by doing that and I'm going to make this the last branch over here.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.670
So here's going to be the resistance are 8

01:48.310 --> 01:50.740
and now that has to be in series with the resistance.

01:50.760 --> 01:51.250
R10

01:55.690 --> 01:56.130
OK.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.720
So I've included both of those.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.790
The next thing I have is the resistance R nine and R nine.

02:01.830 --> 02:06.190
Actually what I'm going to do now is if I label this point here point A.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.120
Now let's just continue this line.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.930
So let me call this here point A.

02:11.460 --> 02:15.930
And I know I'm going to label this point over here which is after our 10 I'm going to label this point

02:15.930 --> 02:17.460
here point B.

02:17.550 --> 02:18.840
I'm going to redraw like this.

02:18.840 --> 02:21.440
So this is going to be point A and Point B.

02:21.510 --> 02:27.040
The only thing I require now is that the resistance R 9 goes from point A to Point B.

02:27.060 --> 02:30.880
So the going from point A to Point B would be this one right here.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.430
So all you have to do here is just draw a line and there's only one resistance

02:37.960 --> 02:38.840
so let me label these.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.690
This is our 9.

02:40.730 --> 02:42.760
This would be our 8.

02:43.120 --> 02:48.370
This would be resistance 10 and we have all the values there.

02:48.380 --> 02:51.370
Now let me label this point over here a point see.

02:52.070 --> 02:58.330
OK so between Point B and point C I have to include a resistance R 7.

02:58.340 --> 02:59.960
So let me go ahead and do that.

02:59.990 --> 03:01.180
I can even curve this up here.

03:01.190 --> 03:02.170
Doesn't matter.

03:02.580 --> 03:03.090
OK.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.120
And let me place Point C over here.

03:06.580 --> 03:11.300
The only thing I need to do is now to include the resistance R7 between those two points.

03:13.320 --> 03:13.910
All right.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.390
Let's do that.

03:15.450 --> 03:19.550
This will be resistance are seven OK.

03:19.610 --> 03:26.000
And now the only thing I need to do is connect point A to point C and between point A and Point C I

03:26.000 --> 03:29.160
need to include this resistance are 6.

03:29.230 --> 03:34.300
Now rather than making another diagonal line here what I'm going to do is I'm going to go straight across.

03:34.340 --> 03:38.380
Again I can make the wires as long as I want.

03:38.590 --> 03:43.210
And now I can go straight down and include the resistance R6

03:47.620 --> 03:48.790
OK.

03:49.170 --> 03:52.890
And this is the resistance R6 now.

03:52.890 --> 03:58.980
So everything in this orange shaded area I've represented down here by the diagram and now I can go

03:58.980 --> 04:02.070
ahead and quickly simplify this.

04:02.100 --> 04:07.570
So the first thing I would start off is all the way on the right hand side here I have two resistors.

04:08.820 --> 04:11.310
That are in series with one another.

04:11.530 --> 04:16.980
If both of those are in series with one another to get the equivalent resistance of everything in this

04:17.190 --> 04:19.670
blue shaded area you simply have to add them up.

04:19.950 --> 04:24.160
So this should be equivalent to a 12 Omers ister.

04:24.390 --> 04:25.370
And then what do I have.

04:25.370 --> 04:37.140
Well and then you have a 12 ohm resistor that is in parallel with R 9 R 9 is a 6 Omers is there.

04:37.370 --> 04:45.140
So what I can now do is I can combine this branch with this branch.

04:45.410 --> 04:53.210
Now if I do that I you go ahead and do this are equivalent for both of those together.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.210
Let's call that our equivalent one.

04:57.210 --> 05:00.170
I'm going to have a lot of different equivalent resistances here.

05:00.450 --> 05:03.420
So I have two of them if I have two of them I can use my trick.

05:03.420 --> 05:14.420
Multiply them and divided by the sum you get 12 multiplied by six and divided by 18 18 is six times

05:14.420 --> 05:15.190
three actually.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.230
And the reason I want to do that it's just easier to do the math.

05:18.350 --> 05:22.870
What you should end up with is for alms.

05:22.890 --> 05:29.670
So this whole you know these three resistors here at the end of my network they're equivalent to a forum

05:29.710 --> 05:30.200
resistor

05:33.130 --> 05:35.610
so that simplifies things a little bit.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.000
So now when I'm going to do is I'm going to keep that in mind and I'm actually going to just simplify

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
this picture.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.220
So let's get rid of that.

05:43.300 --> 05:47.510
Let's actually get rid of all of this and watch what I'm going to do.

05:48.520 --> 05:53.660
I'll get rid of that line get rid of that line instead of calling it our 9 what I'm now going to do

05:53.660 --> 06:00.040
is I'm going to simply call it our equivalent one our equivalent one.

06:00.400 --> 06:07.710
And I know that this here is equivalent to a forum resistor and get rid of both of those lines.

06:07.710 --> 06:08.580
OK.

06:08.850 --> 06:13.130
Now I'm kind of really simplifying the network quite a bit.

06:13.470 --> 06:21.030
Now the next thing I notice is I have two resistors that are in series with one another because whatever

06:21.030 --> 06:28.010
current flows here through this eq. resistants is going to flow through the are seven.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.340
So both of those are in series with one another.

06:32.630 --> 06:39.590
If they're in series with one another that means you can simply add up their resistances to get the

06:39.590 --> 06:41.300
equivalent resistance.

06:41.780 --> 06:48.140
So I don't know what I'm going to call our equivalent to is the series combination of our equivalent

06:48.140 --> 06:56.230
one which is four plus are seven and the value of our seven was eight.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.790
So this here is 12 ohms OK.

07:01.290 --> 07:04.470
So now you can actually combine both of those into one.

07:05.160 --> 07:12.690
And then that's 12 ohm equivalent resistance is then going to be in parallel with the resistance are

07:12.750 --> 07:18.630
six look which are six is equal to it's equal to six ohms.

07:18.630 --> 07:26.010
So what we have is a 12 ohm resistor that is in parallel with a six ohm resistor or we already did that

07:26.010 --> 07:27.070
case.

07:27.120 --> 07:30.670
This is exactly what we did over here.

07:30.700 --> 07:39.780
So that means that this entire network this entire network here has to be equivalent to a four Omers

07:39.780 --> 07:48.680
this the so I can replace everything here in this orange blob by an equivalent four ohm resistor.

07:48.680 --> 07:53.940
So make sure you understand the steps that I took in order to achieve this value.

07:53.960 --> 07:58.680
So now all we're going to do is well let's just simplify we've actually simplify this entire network.

07:58.700 --> 08:00.970
So let's kind of eliminate some of this stuff here

08:03.940 --> 08:09.240
and let's simplify the network even further and make some more room.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.870
OK.

08:10.870 --> 08:13.660
So this is what we have now.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.630
So between points A and C you know this is what I'm going to have.

08:18.700 --> 08:28.760
I have an equivalent resistance equal to forums so I'm going to draw that.

08:28.850 --> 08:30.520
This was our equivalent.

08:30.680 --> 08:34.410
And this here was equal to forums and that took care of everything.

08:34.430 --> 08:39.540
Are Six are seven are eight are nine and are 10.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.540
And this was points a in point see.

08:41.540 --> 08:44.190
Now I have to draw the rest of the network.

08:45.030 --> 08:50.200
OK well let's label some other points maybe call this point D.

08:50.270 --> 08:52.140
Let's call this point E.

08:52.790 --> 08:59.830
If I go between point C and point D I have to include a forum resistor at this point down over here

08:59.840 --> 09:05.090
I'm sorry this sphere should be labeled point see my mistake.

09:05.720 --> 09:08.100
OK so be go in between points see him point D.

09:08.110 --> 09:11.360
I should have the equivalent the resistance are five

09:17.260 --> 09:18.170
point D.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.260
And this is the resistance are five.

09:22.390 --> 09:27.130
Now again in order to eliminate this diagonal resistance Well that's fine.

09:27.130 --> 09:28.600
I could just include a straight line.

09:28.600 --> 09:31.150
I could make the wire a little bit longer.

09:31.510 --> 09:33.860
And now between point A and Point D.

09:34.060 --> 09:35.970
It's this one going straight down.

09:36.100 --> 09:38.320
I have to include this resistance are four

09:42.850 --> 09:47.580
I just don't like those diagonal resistors are for going down.

09:48.710 --> 09:49.370
OK.

09:49.810 --> 09:54.850
And now going from point A to Point B I'm going to include the resistance are three

10:02.580 --> 10:03.760
call this point.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.390
And this is the resistance are three.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.470
All right and the last one is between point E and point D.

10:10.550 --> 10:15.380
I include the resistance are two in rather than going on a diagonal here I'm just going to make this

10:15.380 --> 10:19.830
wire longer and then I include this resistance are two

10:26.060 --> 10:26.690
OK.

10:27.130 --> 10:29.300
And now I'll just finish the diagram here.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.400
This should go all the way to point B.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.300
And this one will go to Point A.

10:34.310 --> 10:37.860
But I still have to include the resistance are one up here.

10:38.060 --> 10:39.460
Let me go ahead and do that.

10:44.690 --> 10:45.180
OK.

10:45.350 --> 10:50.570
And r1 is labeled here and that's the 6 ohm resistance.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.890
All right so now we need to simplify this a little bit more again.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.850
I'm going to start on the right hand side of this diagram.

10:55.940 --> 11:02.090
First thing I'm going to do is I notice that between well everything all the current flowing in here.

11:03.370 --> 11:05.570
Is going to be the same.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.810
So that's the current that's going to flow through an equivalent resistance.

11:09.810 --> 11:13.440
It's the current that's going to flow through the resistance are five.

11:13.510 --> 11:26.030
So right away I can combine both of those because they are in series with one another so are equivalent

11:26.140 --> 11:27.060
in blue.

11:27.290 --> 11:30.920
I don't know which number we're at but let's just call it number three for now.

11:31.100 --> 11:36.530
This here is simply going to be the forum resistor which is in series with the resistance are five

11:39.590 --> 11:40.580
and are five.

11:40.580 --> 11:43.420
I look back on this top diagram that was also four.

11:43.430 --> 11:49.170
So that means this guy here has to be 8 ohms OK.

11:50.610 --> 11:51.720
So far so good.

11:51.960 --> 12:00.300
So now I have this outer branches basically one big 8 ohm resistor which is now going to be in parallel

12:00.300 --> 12:04.170
with the resistance are four.

12:04.170 --> 12:04.500
All right.

12:04.560 --> 12:11.540
We have an 8 ohm resistor which is in parallel with the resistance are four and R for have a look.

12:11.540 --> 12:13.470
It's also 8 ohms.

12:13.470 --> 12:17.250
So you have eight ohms and also 8 ohms.

12:17.310 --> 12:18.770
So what does that mean.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.330
Well that's an easy calculation to do.

12:21.390 --> 12:22.230
Let's call this

12:25.340 --> 12:28.610
our equivalent oops let's call this our equivalent for

12:31.810 --> 12:34.340
our equivalent for.

12:34.690 --> 12:42.080
So we have eight ohms which was our our equivalent three and eight ohms from the resistance are four.

12:42.370 --> 12:51.570
You multiply them divided by the sum eight times eight is 64 divided by 16 is me for.

12:51.780 --> 12:52.220
All right.

12:52.230 --> 13:02.040
So the equivalent resistance of these three resistors in my network here are equivalent to a forum resistor.

13:02.750 --> 13:09.110
So we can actually just simplify this diagram let's simplify the diagram and just replace everything

13:09.110 --> 13:10.250
with a forum resistor

13:13.430 --> 13:18.200
that have columnist's are for now and replacing it with an equivalent resistance.

13:18.200 --> 13:27.600
This is our equivalent for and it's equivalent to a forum resistor is what we found now we repeat the

13:27.600 --> 13:29.290
same steps as we did.

13:29.790 --> 13:32.040
Hopefully you start getting the hang of it now.

13:32.730 --> 13:39.270
So again now if you look at this branch over here both of these resistors are three and are equivalent

13:39.270 --> 13:43.170
four are in series with one another.

13:43.510 --> 13:45.270
If they are in series with each other

13:49.360 --> 13:55.540
that means the equivalent resistance let's call it our equivalent five in this case you simply add them

13:55.540 --> 13:57.150
up.

13:57.280 --> 14:03.710
So we have our three which is given by four and we have our equivalent for which was also four.

14:03.730 --> 14:10.290
So you get four plus four which equals to eight ohms.

14:10.340 --> 14:16.130
All right so now what do we have we have 8 ohms out here on this outer branch and the middle branch

14:16.130 --> 14:20.110
here are two our two is also equal to eight.

14:20.180 --> 14:22.320
We just did a case like that right.

14:22.340 --> 14:24.120
So we have 8 ohms right here.

14:25.890 --> 14:31.450
That is in in parallel with another 8 ohm.

14:31.670 --> 14:33.480
In that case we just did right.

14:33.620 --> 14:36.150
We just did that case right over here.

14:36.330 --> 14:39.220
We have 8 ohms in parallel with another 8 ohms.

14:39.330 --> 14:42.760
That's equivalent to a forum resistor.

14:42.900 --> 14:48.330
So that means that I can actually simplify this entire is these three resistors here on the right hand

14:48.330 --> 14:51.910
side by an equivalent four ohm resistor.

14:51.960 --> 14:55.180
So let me go ahead and clean this diagram up.

14:55.470 --> 14:57.530
Replace all of this.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.360
Let's relabel this

15:02.220 --> 15:03.130
all right.

15:03.610 --> 15:04.570
And the last part

15:09.740 --> 15:18.470
this is basically another equivalent resistance and this we said was going to be a four ohm resistor

15:20.030 --> 15:27.500
because I had an 8 ohm previously that was in parallel with another 8 ohm.

15:27.610 --> 15:30.260
That gives me a forum resistor.

15:30.260 --> 15:30.790
All right.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.770
On our final

15:34.290 --> 15:44.540
breakdown is simply looking at this branch are one which is going to simply be in series with this other

15:44.540 --> 15:47.730
our equivalent resistor.

15:47.740 --> 15:49.750
So what do we get at the end.

15:50.020 --> 15:56.380
The total are equivalent between points and point B.

15:56.410 --> 16:02.730
Now you simply use the series combination that gives me six plus four.

16:02.740 --> 16:08.980
That was a lot of work in order to get 10 ohms but this is 10 ohms is the equivalent resistance of this

16:08.980 --> 16:10.230
entire network.

16:12.040 --> 16:16.750
So hopefully you understand the steps only if you're given two points like this I would always suggest

16:16.750 --> 16:20.550
kind of starting at the opposite end and kind of working your way back.

16:20.550 --> 16:24.070
The way I did I think this is kind of a straight forward method.

16:24.070 --> 16:30.160
Sometimes it's a little tedious like in this case but it's still pretty straightforward I think.

16:30.160 --> 16:30.370
All right.

16:30.370 --> 16:33.780
So maybe you have to redo this one again try it out on your own.

16:33.790 --> 16:38.560
Remember you can always change the shape of the circuit in order to simplify things.
