00:00.270 --> 00:02.360
All right I want to look at this example now.

00:02.760 --> 00:08.490
Both of these examples here are combinations of combinations and what we want to find now is what is

00:08.490 --> 00:12.660
the equivalent resistance between points and B for each case.

00:12.660 --> 00:18.390
And we're going to assume that every resistor here in this network each one has a value equal to Ohmes.

00:18.720 --> 00:20.420
So how would we solve this problem here.

00:20.580 --> 00:23.020
Let's start with case number one.

00:23.040 --> 00:29.160
Now the case number one here the key to this problem here and the mistake that students often make is

00:29.160 --> 00:33.410
they first try to simplify it using resistors in series.

00:33.720 --> 00:40.230
But really the goal here is to notify or to notice that I would group them together like this.

00:40.260 --> 00:42.310
I would first simplify this one.

00:42.510 --> 00:47.380
These three resistors and these three resistors are all in parallel with each other.

00:47.940 --> 00:54.900
And then I would simplify both of these resistors these two resistors here are also in parallel with

00:54.900 --> 00:55.980
each other.

00:56.280 --> 01:02.100
And then once I have both of those simplified then I would simply add the two of them in series with

01:02.100 --> 01:03.160
one another.

01:03.180 --> 01:04.900
So let's go ahead and do that.

01:05.460 --> 01:11.010
So for the first three over here what I'm going to do is I'm simply going to apply the equation for

01:11.010 --> 01:19.110
equivalent resistors and I know that one over our equivalent is simply one over our again here it's

01:19.110 --> 01:23.770
going to be a plus one over our plus one over our.

01:23.820 --> 01:26.290
So in this case it's simply three over our.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.890
And I know the resistance here is two for each one of those.

01:29.910 --> 01:31.600
So it's simply three over two.

01:31.860 --> 01:41.460
So at the end the equivalent resistance for those three combinations is two over three ohms.

01:41.820 --> 01:47.700
I can use the same argument now to find what the second combination is what you're going to find now

01:47.700 --> 01:52.320
is our equivalent of is simply going to be one.

01:52.460 --> 01:57.950
And here I have to say I can use the trick I can multiply them divided by the sum you multiply two times

01:57.950 --> 02:00.790
two you get four divided by the sum which is also 4.

02:01.010 --> 02:03.550
You get one on.

02:03.630 --> 02:03.990
All right.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.090
So now look at what we have.

02:06.090 --> 02:10.450
If you go ahead and redraw this picture this is what we now have we have a point here.

02:11.010 --> 02:12.070
I have a wire.

02:12.330 --> 02:19.540
I have it connecting an R equivalent equal to two thirds.

02:19.760 --> 02:27.780
And now I have another wire that is connecting a equivalent resistance equal to 1 ohm.

02:28.170 --> 02:31.720
So this becomes pretty straight for then I go all the way to point B.

02:32.430 --> 02:36.270
So all I have to do now is to combine both of those.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.490
You simply apply the same trick now.

02:38.820 --> 02:45.200
Except now we simply have two resistors that are in series with one another and if resistors are in

02:45.200 --> 02:50.660
series with one another all you have to do is simply add them up.

02:50.840 --> 02:55.420
So we have two equivalent resistors that are now in series.

02:56.330 --> 02:59.690
So the total are equivalent.

02:59.900 --> 03:07.710
The blue combination over here is simply going to be two thirds plus one.

03:07.770 --> 03:16.210
So that is simply two thirds plus three thirds is MI 5 third's.

03:16.420 --> 03:22.000
So the total equivalent resistance if I want to represent this whole network by 1 It simply has to be

03:22.000 --> 03:25.130
equal to 5 thirds and that's it.

03:26.460 --> 03:28.700
All right how about the second combination here.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.350
The second combination is slightly different.

03:31.380 --> 03:34.350
It looks like I have two branches here.

03:34.890 --> 03:35.930
Here's a branch number one

03:39.440 --> 03:41.790
that is in parallel with branch number two.

03:44.760 --> 03:50.420
Now the way you would simplify this one is I would first simplify each branch for example and branch

03:50.430 --> 03:52.110
number one the top branch.

03:52.380 --> 03:56.880
I have two resistors that are in series with each other.

03:56.990 --> 04:02.820
So the equivalent resistance of everything here in the blue highlighted region.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.210
Again there's two resistors here.

04:05.420 --> 04:13.120
So our equivalent for this guy is simply two plus two is me four ohms.

04:13.290 --> 04:19.950
Now for the orange case over here I have three of them that are in series with each other.

04:20.360 --> 04:27.240
So the equivalent resistance for this branch simply equals the 6 ohms.

04:27.290 --> 04:38.580
So now what you've done is you have a point here we have an equivalent resistance which is our blue.

04:38.870 --> 04:41.120
And now that goes all the way to point B.

04:43.710 --> 04:52.070
And I have that now that is in parallel with an equivalent resistance given by the orange case.

04:53.910 --> 04:56.440
Now just simplify the circuit again.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.370
This is what you have.

04:58.770 --> 05:01.100
Let's fill in our values.

05:01.260 --> 05:08.900
We have our equivalent here which equals to forums and the orange one I found that our equivalent was

05:08.900 --> 05:11.120
equal to 6 ohms.

05:11.120 --> 05:15.170
So now I simply have two resistors that are in parallel with each other.

05:15.350 --> 05:18.440
The way I simplify that is that my are equivalent.

05:18.470 --> 05:23.300
Let's just call it the total are equivalent since there's two of them I can simply multiply them and

05:23.300 --> 05:31.490
divided by the sum you multiply them you get four times six divided by the sum six plus four gives me

05:31.490 --> 05:32.320
10.

05:32.870 --> 05:40.540
So you get 24 divided by 10 which gives me 2.4 ohms.

05:40.820 --> 05:47.000
So the equivalent resistance of this entire network is equivalent to a 2.4 ohm resistor.

05:47.090 --> 05:51.530
So this is how you got to be a little bit careful when you're dealing with combinations of combinations.

05:52.390 --> 05:54.790
Hopefully this example highlights the different cases.
