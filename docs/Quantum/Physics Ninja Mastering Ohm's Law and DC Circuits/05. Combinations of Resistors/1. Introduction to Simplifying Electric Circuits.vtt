Write section for deals with combinations of resistors.

00:03.660 --> 00:08.490
This section here will allow us to simplify electric circuits and some of them we're going to see they're

00:08.500 --> 00:13.050
going look really complicated at the beginning but using some techniques to simplify them we can reduce

00:13.050 --> 00:17.820
them to very very simple circuits and the nice thing about simple circuits it's very easy to apply Ohm's

00:17.820 --> 00:19.860
law to find the power and so on.

00:20.130 --> 00:24.060
So we first have to learn how to identify what the different combinations are.

00:24.060 --> 00:28.450
I've kind of here we have two little diagrams here showing you two different combinations.

00:28.470 --> 00:33.660
If I only have two different resistors so the resistors here represented by the light bulbs there's

00:33.660 --> 00:39.210
two ways to connect two light bulbs to a power supply to this battery over here.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.230
The first way would be to connect them in parallel in parallel.

00:43.230 --> 00:48.490
It means if you count the number of loops over here you have more than a single loop.

00:48.540 --> 00:53.550
We've got our first loop here which connects to the resistor are two of the power supply.

00:53.760 --> 00:59.810
And then there's another loop that starts from this bulb and forms its own loop.

00:59.970 --> 01:07.130
And when you have a system like this this is said that both resistors here are in parallel to each other.

01:07.170 --> 01:09.610
The diagram here on the right hand side.

01:09.870 --> 01:14.570
Again if I connect both of them one right after another.

01:14.710 --> 01:17.490
So you have connected the first light bulb to the power supply.

01:17.500 --> 01:24.460
Now I attach another wire and connected immediately after and then coming back here in this case here

01:24.460 --> 01:27.350
the resistors are said to be in series with one another.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.590
So we're going to learn that there's different ways to simplify circuits but you have to be able to

01:32.590 --> 01:35.600
identify are the resistors in series with each other.

01:35.770 --> 01:37.980
Or are they in parallel with one another.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.870
Because there's going to be different sets of rules for each different case.

01:41.860 --> 01:46.470
So let's go ahead and look at each different case and why we're able to simplify them.
