All right one last case here what happens if you have more than two.

00:03.810 --> 00:05.530
We previously saw the equation.

00:05.640 --> 00:11.890
Well if you have more than two equation is simply just a generalization of that.

00:11.910 --> 00:14.270
So now you simply add them all up except you don't.

00:14.310 --> 00:17.280
You always add the reciprocal of the resistance value.

00:17.820 --> 00:25.680
So if you have three terms simply looks like this one over are one plus one over R2 plus one over our

00:25.680 --> 00:28.130
three and that's it.

00:28.140 --> 00:28.890
That's our value.

00:28.890 --> 00:32.310
Now for one divided by my equivalent resistance.

00:32.640 --> 00:36.180
So let's consider this case imagine here this was a three ohm resistance.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.360
This was a six resistance.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.810
This was a one ohm resistance.

00:40.890 --> 00:47.280
So the way to apply the formula here is one divided by my equivalent resistance value is 1 over three

00:48.150 --> 00:53.300
plus one over six plus one over one.

00:53.310 --> 00:54.060
All right.

00:54.060 --> 00:56.380
I could put things on a common denominator.

00:56.850 --> 01:04.210
Maybe six is kind of a good common denominator here you'd have two plus one plus six.

01:04.290 --> 01:10.270
This gives me nine over six which I can simplify to three over two.

01:11.160 --> 01:11.510
OK.

01:11.510 --> 01:14.660
And that's the value for one divided by are equivalent.

01:14.940 --> 01:18.210
So at the end of the day are equivalent.

01:18.210 --> 01:22.740
You simply have to flip this number gives me two thirds.

01:23.030 --> 01:28.350
One thing I want you to notice about this equivalent value of the resistance that I got.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.420
Notice it's less than 1 right.

01:31.440 --> 01:39.260
The smallest value I had here was 1 ohm and the value of the equivalent resistance is always going to

01:39.260 --> 01:44.970
be smaller than the smallest value that you have in for your original circuit.

01:45.020 --> 01:49.640
So keep that in mind if ever you do a calculation of resistors in parallel and you end up getting a

01:49.640 --> 01:53.600
bigger number than one or more you must make a mistake somewhere.

01:53.630 --> 01:55.510
You're always going to get a smaller value.

01:57.140 --> 02:04.030
Now I previously showed you a trick where I was you know if you only had two of them it was very easy

02:04.030 --> 02:06.950
to simply multiply them and divided by the sum.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.850
In this case I have three but can I use that trick.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.650
Well you can what you can do is you can treat them two at a time.

02:13.850 --> 02:16.470
Well let me maybe use a different color here.

02:16.630 --> 02:19.140
Let me highlight what I want to show you here.

02:19.160 --> 02:25.510
So the way I would do it now is well let's consider everything in the green box.

02:25.850 --> 02:27.640
Everything in these green boxes.

02:27.680 --> 02:33.410
I can simplify everything in the green box and represent everything in the green box by one equivalent

02:33.410 --> 02:34.680
resistance.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.700
And I know how to do that because the value here.

02:40.240 --> 02:45.360
Well what I want to do the value here would be are equivalent.

02:45.380 --> 02:50.450
Let's call our equivalent one because I have to do this in two steps in order to find the equivalent

02:50.450 --> 02:52.650
resistance of everything in this green box.

02:52.670 --> 02:53.560
There's only two.

02:53.810 --> 03:02.660
You simply multiply them and divided by the sum we just did that case 18 over 9 years Me 2 ohms.

03:02.750 --> 03:08.510
So now what I can do is well if you're going to redraw the circuit what it would look like it would

03:08.510 --> 03:10.080
look something like this.

03:10.100 --> 03:17.550
So you really have everything in the green box here which is a tool resistor which is now in parallel

03:17.550 --> 03:21.900
with everything outside the Green Box is a 1 ohm resistor

03:28.720 --> 03:36.070
while Guess what I can do now I could apply the same trick because now I have two resistors in parallel

03:36.070 --> 03:36.870
with each other.

03:38.150 --> 03:42.750
I can use the same trick as I previously did and find the total equivalent resistance.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.050
So are equivalent.

03:45.440 --> 03:52.910
I have a 2 and a 1 only multiply them 2 times 1 divided by the sum two plus one gives me three at the

03:52.910 --> 03:53.060
end.

03:53.060 --> 03:57.340
I get two thirds of an ohm.

03:57.350 --> 04:02.450
Notice I get the exact same values I did using kind of the longer approach.

04:02.540 --> 04:02.960
OK.

04:03.110 --> 04:09.710
So even if you have more than two you can still just pair them up simplify them using our trick and

04:09.710 --> 04:12.590
then just repeat the same steps.

04:12.590 --> 04:14.410
Pretty straightforward.
