Hi everybody welcome to my class on DC circuits by DC circuits I simply mean that means direct current

00:07.260 --> 00:14.100
circuits and that basically means that the direction of the current eye the direction doesn't change.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.240
So the direction let me just write that down.

00:16.440 --> 00:22.010
Direction is constant.

00:22.140 --> 00:25.060
Now the magnitude of the current can change but the direction doesn't change.

00:25.060 --> 00:30.390
So you can go from zero to a maximum value or it can change from some maximum value to zero but the

00:30.390 --> 00:32.010
direction doesn't change.

00:32.160 --> 00:36.590
If you want circuits where the direction changes they refer to those as AC circuits.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.290
All right here's kind of a list of topics that I cover in this class we're going to start with current

00:40.290 --> 00:44.960
and the motion of charges when you place an electric field in a wire from a microscopic viewpoint.

00:44.970 --> 00:46.950
What does that look like.

00:47.070 --> 00:51.420
Once we have those kind of concepts nailed down we're going to introduce the concept of resistance something

00:51.420 --> 00:56.940
that resists the flow of charges moving and the concept of resistivity where they are going to link

00:56.940 --> 01:00.210
everything together the resistance the current and something called ohms law.

01:00.240 --> 01:06.030
We introduced the concept of potential difference and earmuffs.

01:06.230 --> 01:12.140
After that we're going to look at energy when it relates to electric circuits and by energy are typically

01:12.230 --> 01:17.360
looking at how much power is being supplied by these power supplies by the batteries in the circuit

01:17.770 --> 01:22.520
and how much energy is being used and what is the rate at which energy is being used in some of these

01:22.520 --> 01:23.630
resistors.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.130
Sections 4 and 5.

01:25.130 --> 01:30.650
So Section 4 is combinations of resistors in many circuits that you see although they might look complicated

01:30.650 --> 01:34.550
there are techniques that can reduce the circuit that something that looks really really complicated

01:34.820 --> 01:36.600
the something that's much simpler.

01:36.890 --> 01:42.410
So we're going to learn different methods to simplify circuits whether you have some resistors in series

01:42.450 --> 01:46.730
in parallel we have techniques that we can use in order to simplify them and we'll practice a whole

01:46.730 --> 01:48.400
bunch of problems together.

01:48.410 --> 01:54.590
Section 5 is really the bulk and it's really applying to rules Kirchoff's rules in order to analyze

01:54.680 --> 01:55.610
any circuit.

01:55.670 --> 02:00.650
For example analyzing the circuit on the right hand side by the end of this section would be very very

02:00.650 --> 02:05.330
easy and by analyzing I mean are you able to find the current through every single resistor.

02:05.330 --> 02:09.100
Are you able to find that potential difference across every resistor.

02:09.170 --> 02:13.680
Can you then use that information to look at the power being supplied by every battery in the circuit

02:13.970 --> 02:17.930
and the power being dissipated by every resistor in your circuit.

02:17.980 --> 02:22.580
The last section then we're going to introduce a new component to our circuits we're going to plug in

02:22.580 --> 02:28.260
capacitors into our circuits like the circuit shown down below.

02:28.700 --> 02:33.380
So that is what happens what changes are you able to analyze then the current the charge and the voltage

02:33.380 --> 02:36.540
across the capacitor or across any other point in the circuit.

02:36.740 --> 02:42.200
Well look at different methods to analyze what happens when you first close a switch versus what happens

02:42.200 --> 02:44.770
over a longer period of time.

02:44.780 --> 02:49.310
So by the end of this class you're going to look at circuits on the right hand side and say yeah those

02:49.310 --> 02:50.710
are pretty easy now.

02:51.020 --> 02:54.220
And that's the overall goal of my class so let's get started.

02:54.330 --> 02:59.120
I have some fun at the end there is over 50 problems that you can practice by yourself with detailed

02:59.120 --> 03:01.830
solutions worked out the best part is.

03:01.910 --> 03:04.180
Message me any time and I'll get back to you.

03:04.220 --> 03:04.850
OK.

03:05.420 --> 03:06.080
Let's do this.
