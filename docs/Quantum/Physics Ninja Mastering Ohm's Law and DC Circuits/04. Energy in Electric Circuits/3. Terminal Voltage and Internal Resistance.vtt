00:00.860 --> 00:03.530
All right we're getting closer now to real circuits here.

00:03.540 --> 00:11.070
So let's consider this one here we have a battery which has an e-mail equal to E and it's connected

00:11.070 --> 00:12.000
to a resistor.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.650
There are now the wire itself.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.890
Here we're going to neglect any of the resistance of the wire because it's so much smaller than the

00:19.890 --> 00:22.590
resistance here that have connected to it.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.180
Now in the ideal case

00:27.180 --> 00:33.290
the one I have in that diagram if you wanted to calculate the current well is say we have an MF here

00:33.300 --> 00:39.390
so the terminal voltage here if you label the points the positive terminal is a the negative terminal

00:39.390 --> 00:44.520
is B the voltage between points and B V-A mine is.

00:44.520 --> 00:48.010
VB is given by that ESF.

00:48.270 --> 00:56.010
And now if you apply Ohm's law to this Ohm's law says that voltage must be equal to the current multiplied

00:56.010 --> 00:57.790
by the resistance.

00:57.870 --> 01:04.260
So the current that you're going to get is going to be equal to the IMF or the battery divided by the

01:04.260 --> 01:07.720
resistance a resistor that I connect to it.

01:08.010 --> 01:11.420
So the smaller I make the resistance the more current I'm going to get.

01:11.420 --> 01:14.980
The bigger I make the resistance the less current I get.

01:15.090 --> 01:17.460
Now how does that compare to real life

01:21.360 --> 01:26.590
in real life actually if you go ahead and look at what this terminal voltages.

01:26.790 --> 01:27.690
That's what this is right.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.800
The voltage between the two ends of the battery

01:33.980 --> 01:38.780
the terminal voltage is actually a little bit smaller than that and it's a little bit smaller than that

01:38.810 --> 01:43.390
because inside the battery there is also some internal resistance

01:46.660 --> 01:49.080
my batteries get hot.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.580
Or am I going with this.

01:50.590 --> 01:52.180
Let's try this again.

01:52.810 --> 01:59.050
Internal resistance.

01:59.220 --> 02:03.780
And when you have internal resistance if you go ahead and look at the terminal voltage.

02:03.780 --> 02:10.950
Now again if I would go through and I measure the voltage across the battery actually you get something

02:10.950 --> 02:14.480
that is a little bit smaller.

02:14.520 --> 02:21.240
First you get my ideal MF source but you'd get something that's a little bit smaller and the amount

02:21.240 --> 02:25.490
that it's smaller will depend on how much current is actually flowing in the circuit.

02:25.770 --> 02:29.370
And it also depends on the internal resistance so little are.

02:29.370 --> 02:33.880
Here is what I'm going to call this internal resistance.

02:34.560 --> 02:38.450
Actually I'm just connect that to what I've already written down.

02:39.180 --> 02:42.720
So this here is the internal resistance of the battery.

02:42.750 --> 02:48.240
So now if you really wanted to apply ohms law to this circuit what you would have to do now is well

02:48.240 --> 02:53.590
this is the voltage the terminal voltage between the two ends of the battery.

02:53.820 --> 03:02.070
So you'd write that down e minus the current I are and that there has to be equal to the resistance

03:02.610 --> 03:07.630
multiplied by the current.

03:07.650 --> 03:10.020
All right and now I can go ahead and calculate what the current is.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.840
So you have to bring this term on the other side.

03:13.170 --> 03:16.920
If I do that and then a group terms together this is the current that I get.

03:22.660 --> 03:29.310
So we see that for a real battery which has some internal resistance to it.

03:29.420 --> 03:33.000
The amount of current that you're going to get is going to be a little bit smaller.

03:33.290 --> 03:42.260
It's a little bit smaller than the ideal case because you get a bigger resistance you get whatever resistance

03:42.260 --> 03:44.530
you have that you've connected to it.

03:44.540 --> 03:50.210
You also have an additional internal resistance of the battery and that tends to make the voltage difference

03:50.210 --> 03:51.710
smaller.

03:51.710 --> 03:56.940
And if the voltage difference is smaller that's going to lead to less current.

03:57.610 --> 03:57.990
OK.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.680
So just a few words about that.
