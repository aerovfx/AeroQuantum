Here's another kind of view of the previous picture as the scribing.

00:03.660 --> 00:05.440
So here's our battery again.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.050
The internal resistance is given by a lowercase r.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.900
Here's the ideal EMR.

00:10.920 --> 00:17.680
Inside the battery and some resistance that is maybe connected to to form a closed loop circuit.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.070
Imagine here you have a current.

00:19.120 --> 00:29.670
I it remember our expression now for the terminal voltage was V-A mine is VB would be equal to the ideal

00:31.350 --> 00:33.710
minus i r.

00:34.080 --> 00:40.050
Actually if you call this V again just the voltage of the battery if you plug that voltage as a function

00:40.050 --> 00:43.230
of the current look what you get here.

00:43.770 --> 00:45.930
If the current is zero.

00:46.200 --> 00:46.780
Right.

00:46.800 --> 00:52.260
If there is no closed loop you would have a kind of just an open circuit over here you wouldn't have

00:52.260 --> 00:53.700
any current.

00:53.730 --> 01:01.870
So in that case the voltage of the battery is simply equal to the MF of the ideal ium F..

01:01.920 --> 01:03.190
So let's write that down.

01:03.210 --> 01:06.580
So if current equals to zero.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.640
So that's if for example there's a break here or it's not connected to any resistance or you'd have

01:11.640 --> 01:12.750
zero current.

01:12.900 --> 01:20.190
In that case the terminal voltage is simply equal to the ideal M.F. of the battery and that's what you

01:20.190 --> 01:21.230
get over here.

01:21.360 --> 01:27.270
Now as more and more current depending on what you've connected here to form a closed loop the more

01:27.270 --> 01:29.600
current that you get.

01:30.810 --> 01:36.350
What that would cause would be that the terminal voltage here would go down more.

01:36.700 --> 01:41.860
And you could see as a function of I the bigger this current is the more you take away from this ideal.

01:41.860 --> 01:52.340
MF So if you take an example imagine here we have a 12 volt battery ideal battery and imagine the internal

01:52.340 --> 01:56.890
resistance here is 0.5 ohms.

01:56.920 --> 02:02.410
So over here I get if there is no current flowing through it you would measure 12 volts across the terminals

02:02.410 --> 02:03.750
of that battery.

02:04.380 --> 02:10.660
Imagine you connect it to some resistor and then the current is measured and you measure a current equal

02:10.660 --> 02:12.670
to two amps.

02:12.760 --> 02:20.710
So in that case if I go all the way here to two atoms what I would now measure for the voltage across

02:20.710 --> 02:25.030
that the terminals of this battery would be my value over here.

02:25.120 --> 02:34.930
So I get the ideal MF which is 12 minus two multiplied by a 1 1/2 0.5 2 times 1 1/2 gives me one.

02:34.930 --> 02:37.680
So I would actually measure 11 volts.

02:37.680 --> 02:41.560
So you go and you measure the voltage.

02:41.570 --> 02:44.360
In that case you're going to measure 11 volts.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.440
If there's more current You're going to measure a lower voltage for the terminal voltage of that battery

02:48.440 --> 02:54.110
because there ends up being a larger voltage drop across this internal resistance and we'll get more

02:54.110 --> 02:56.850
into this in the next section.
