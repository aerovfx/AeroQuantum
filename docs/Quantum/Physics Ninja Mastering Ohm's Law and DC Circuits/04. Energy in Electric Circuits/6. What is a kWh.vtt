Let me spend a minute here just to discuss a common thing that comes up if you pay for electricity that

00:06.330 --> 00:12.940
is the kilowatt hour the kilowatt hour is often abbreviated just using kwh like this.

00:13.290 --> 00:18.090
If you open up your electricity bill just to watch this video it's going to cost you a certain amount

00:18.090 --> 00:24.610
of money not only from you me but just from the energy that you're using to turn on your computer.

00:25.570 --> 00:27.740
To power your headphones for example.

00:27.900 --> 00:37.910
Ogie and the cost of energy or electricity anyway in the U.S. is approximately 12 cents per kilowatt

00:37.910 --> 00:40.050
hour.

00:40.100 --> 00:44.400
So let's use some dimensional dimensional analysis to give this a go.

00:44.630 --> 00:48.370
So kilo is just a prefix for 1000.

00:48.380 --> 00:55.060
Now the one that we should know a watt is energy right.

00:55.090 --> 00:56.830
Our fuel per unit time

00:59.540 --> 01:05.010
and one hour oil that we know the hour is simply a unit of time.

01:05.090 --> 01:09.350
So this is the unit for a watt.

01:09.350 --> 01:12.880
This is the unit for time for our.

01:13.550 --> 01:20.030
So at the end we have to have we have time here in the numerator time in the denominator.

01:20.030 --> 01:24.950
This is going to give us units of energy at the end right.

01:24.950 --> 01:29.840
Is this going to at the end if I really wanted to convert things I should be able to show that this

01:29.840 --> 01:38.310
comes in units of Jewel and that is a basic unit of energy and S-I unit system.

01:38.380 --> 01:41.380
So let's go ahead and maybe look at that a little bit more.

01:41.410 --> 01:47.440
So what if I wanted to convert this kilowatts into jewel kilowatt hours rather individual let's go see

01:47.440 --> 01:48.400
all we could do that.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.490
So we start off let's assume we just have one kilowatt hour.

01:53.510 --> 01:53.830
OK.

01:53.860 --> 01:55.990
At the end of the day I want to get something in.

01:56.020 --> 02:00.730
I mean the jewel is that well what do I want to do.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.120
I want to get rid of this.

02:02.810 --> 02:04.930
Well let's get rid of the killer right away.

02:04.930 --> 02:05.560
Right.

02:07.680 --> 02:12.060
Because in one K I have a thousand.

02:12.060 --> 02:12.870
Right.

02:13.350 --> 02:19.980
Let's say in one kilowatt I have a thousand watts that'll take care of the first term and now while

02:19.980 --> 02:24.760
I want to get rid of ours I want to get rid of ours I need to divide by hours.

02:24.780 --> 02:34.010
I can go through by going through minutes and then I also want to get rid of minutes and I want to have

02:34.060 --> 02:36.540
minutes here and maybe go to seconds at the end.

02:36.970 --> 02:41.950
OK and that should take care of the units because we start crossing things out kilowatts are going to

02:41.950 --> 02:49.510
cancel here I'll be left with Watts an hour is going to cancel with this one minute is going to cancel

02:49.510 --> 02:50.300
with this one.

02:50.350 --> 02:56.680
And at the end I'm going to get with I'll be left with what multiplied with seconds over here.

02:56.680 --> 03:01.630
And I know that that should give me units of Jewel and Esai units.

03:01.710 --> 03:04.780
Let me just complete this bracket over here in one hour.

03:04.780 --> 03:09.430
I know there is 60 Minutes and in one minute I know there's 60 seconds.

03:09.430 --> 03:12.660
So all I have to do now is just carry this out so you get a thousand.

03:12.670 --> 03:20.970
Multiplied by says 3600 that you get 3600 multiply by a thousand.

03:21.110 --> 03:26.690
So you get three million six hundred thousand joules is equivalent to one kilowatt hour.

03:27.050 --> 03:28.180
Let's write that down.

03:31.800 --> 03:36.850
So you can see they energy companies probably wouldn't want to advertise there.

03:37.230 --> 03:42.510
Well the rates would be pretty low mind you but people would end up using so much energy and Zul and

03:42.510 --> 03:44.370
might scare them off.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.170
Right.

03:45.180 --> 03:50.480
So three million six hundred was unusual.

03:50.580 --> 03:56.760
So the rate that you're paying you are paying a certain amount of money per unit energy that you use

03:57.060 --> 04:02.140
the rate at which you use it at the watt part of it here really doesn't matter.

04:02.520 --> 04:07.650
It's always the amount of the rate that you use multiply by how much time you're going to use that appliance

04:07.650 --> 04:08.300
for.

04:08.370 --> 04:08.580
Right.

04:08.580 --> 04:12.420
To give you the total energy that really matters at the end of the day.

04:12.450 --> 04:12.890
OK.

04:13.140 --> 04:18.300
So kilowatt hour is nothing more than a another fancy word just to say the total energy that you're

04:18.300 --> 04:18.970
going to use.
