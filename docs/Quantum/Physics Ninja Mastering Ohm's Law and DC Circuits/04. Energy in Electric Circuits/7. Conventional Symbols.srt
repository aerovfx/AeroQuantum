00:00.300 --> 00:03.410
All right let's look at some conventional symbols over here.

00:03.450 --> 00:08.280
So voltage sources when we're going to look at circuits are not represented by those big batteries that

00:08.280 --> 00:09.620
I had on the previous one.

00:09.640 --> 00:14.010
And again they're usually represented just by these parallel lines that are of different lengths the

00:14.010 --> 00:18.750
longer length represents the positive terminal the negative for the shorter one represents the negative

00:18.750 --> 00:21.190
terminal in a circuit.

00:21.210 --> 00:22.470
Would kind of look like this.

00:22.470 --> 00:26.190
Sometimes you write the letter E sometimes you would just write the letter V next to it.

00:26.190 --> 00:32.240
And again that always represents the voltage the terminal voltage across across both ends.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.180
And this particular case there is no internal resistance.

00:35.190 --> 00:40.240
If there is an internal resistance you'll sometimes just add another resistance right next to it.

00:40.590 --> 00:45.840
And usually you give it a letter a little our resistor is everywhere in our circuits are going to be

00:45.840 --> 00:51.390
represented by these kind of Sawtooth here again.

00:51.390 --> 00:54.720
And usually you have some value of the resistance next to it.

00:54.720 --> 01:01.170
Now these are often connected by wires and in our circuits here wires are just lines.

01:01.170 --> 01:05.210
For example the segment that goes from 8 to B is just a wire.

01:05.580 --> 01:12.030
And for most of what we do unless the problem explicitly tells you to calculate it and most of what

01:12.030 --> 01:18.350
we do we will neglect any resistance of these wires that connect the batteries to the resistors.

01:18.590 --> 01:19.080
OK.

01:19.380 --> 01:22.360
So the wires let me just do something like this.

01:23.530 --> 01:24.640
Segment of wire

01:28.130 --> 01:29.660
usually no resistance.

01:34.240 --> 01:34.450
All right.

01:34.450 --> 01:39.460
The other thing that often shows up sometimes you have these lines like this it just represents a switch

01:39.460 --> 01:43.360
you'll see more of these switches later on when we talk about capacitors.

01:43.360 --> 01:46.770
But for now you still might see them sometimes in circuits.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.550
So clearly when it's open it means there is no current flowing through that segment of wire that includes

01:51.550 --> 01:52.380
the switch.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.200
And when you would close it well when you close it you could draw like this.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.280
And then you make an electrical connection and now current is free to go by.

02:00.280 --> 02:05.770
So what it's like in this position here is open again no current can flow through there.

02:07.150 --> 02:09.750
And it's basically no current can flow through that segment.

02:09.760 --> 02:15.310
If there's a switch only in one part of a circuit then it could be you might have current flowing in

02:15.310 --> 02:16.140
a different part.

02:16.330 --> 02:23.120
And when it's closed in this position current flow yes the current

02:26.420 --> 02:32.150
an open circuit like this basically represents a case where the resistance between this point and that

02:32.150 --> 02:33.680
point is basically infinite.

02:33.680 --> 02:38.910
And if we have an infinite resistance as we saw from Ohm's law there is no current flowing through it.
