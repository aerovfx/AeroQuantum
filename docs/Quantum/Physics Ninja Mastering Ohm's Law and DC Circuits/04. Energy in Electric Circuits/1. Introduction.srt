00:00.420 --> 00:03.110
Are in this section we're going to look at energy and electric circuits.

00:03.180 --> 00:08.550
More specifically we're going to look at things like power power being supplied by batteries power being

00:08.550 --> 00:11.430
dissipated by resistors.

00:11.430 --> 00:16.620
I'll talk about Electromotive forces and batteries and their internal resistance and everything that

00:16.620 --> 00:18.690
I discuss in this chapter.

00:18.780 --> 00:22.710
The currents are going to be constant.

00:23.550 --> 00:29.010
So in order for there to be a constant current Sometimes you call this a steady state current in order

00:29.010 --> 00:30.960
for there to be a steady state current.

00:30.960 --> 00:39.090
You can imagine here I have a battery and if I want a steady state current regardless of what I have

00:39.420 --> 00:42.460
I need to have a closed loop like this.

00:42.540 --> 00:47.270
This is going to be a requirement for there to be a constant current.

00:47.310 --> 00:52.000
So you need to have close loops if the loop is not closed.

00:52.230 --> 00:56.760
Well what happens if you imagine just a piece of conductor just like a wire.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.960
Here is a piece of wire which doesn't form a closed loop.

01:01.530 --> 01:09.210
Now you can imagine connecting this to or producing an electric field inside this wire.

01:09.210 --> 01:14.640
If I do that well guess what I'm going to produce a current there's going to be a current in the direction

01:14.640 --> 01:17.080
of the electric field that we saw from Ohm's law.

01:17.430 --> 01:17.580
Right.

01:17.580 --> 01:25.110
The electric field is directly proportional to the current density in that conductor.

01:25.110 --> 01:30.780
Now what happens however is if it doesn't form a closed loop Well you're a Benci going to get a build

01:30.780 --> 01:33.220
up of charges on the sides.

01:33.660 --> 01:38.010
So you have positive charges build up on the one side you'll have negative charges build up on the other

01:38.010 --> 01:38.740
side.

01:38.790 --> 01:43.280
And while these charges they also produce an electric field.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.610
So read at the building right at the beginning the electric fuel produced by those charges is small

01:47.610 --> 01:53.040
because there's not a lot of them there as a function of time that electric field gets bigger.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.890
And as if I'm going the time it gets even bigger.

01:54.890 --> 02:01.590
Up until the electric fuel produced by these charges at the end is equal and opposite to the electric

02:01.590 --> 02:06.180
fuel produce you know that set up the current to begin with.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.220
So once the total electric field which is the sum of both of those equals zero.

02:10.340 --> 02:11.900
There's no more current.

02:12.310 --> 02:12.900
OK.

02:13.110 --> 02:17.700
So what we want is we don't want any buildup of charges like this if you get build up of charges your

02:17.700 --> 02:20.940
current going to go to zero and it's not going to be constant.

02:21.630 --> 02:28.410
So what we're going to need then is we're going to need something that keeps on pushing current and

02:28.410 --> 02:31.680
that something is basically effectively a pump.

02:31.890 --> 02:37.290
Well we're going to need now is a pump and it's kind of analogous to kind of water in this water fountain

02:37.290 --> 02:38.580
over here.

02:38.710 --> 02:44.040
Right what the water does or what the pump does is it pushes water up to the top and then water kind

02:44.040 --> 02:48.940
of trickles down through holes and eventually kind of works its way back down.

02:49.410 --> 02:54.210
But without the pump right the water is just simply going to fall down and that's it is not going to

02:54.210 --> 02:55.310
go back up.

02:55.650 --> 03:02.150
So that current that flow of water is basically going to stop if there's no pump in the system.

03:02.190 --> 03:06.420
So our batteries are basically simply going to act like pumps.

03:06.700 --> 03:14.800
They are going to do work on charges and then charges are basically going to be allowed to fall down.

03:15.030 --> 03:18.030
And that's what an electric current is.

03:18.270 --> 03:23.010
Basically this water coming back down and then the pump is the battery that's going to be driving it

03:23.010 --> 03:24.450
back up.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.640
We'll look back at this water analogy in a minute.

03:26.640 --> 03:32.340
But without the pump the water would just fall to the bottom and stay there without the battery the

03:32.340 --> 03:35.620
charges will not move because there is no electric field inside.
