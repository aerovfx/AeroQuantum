All right I want to now talk a little bit about Electromotive forces the short terms.

00:05.640 --> 00:09.930
People use the three letters ESF to describe this.

00:10.050 --> 00:14.730
So let's consider this simple circuit I have over here which forms a closed loop.

00:14.730 --> 00:19.310
So I have this green box here represents just the battery of the label the two terminals of the battery

00:19.320 --> 00:21.000
here is the one positive one negative.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.690
Could be like a 9 volt battery for example.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.180
And now well we know what's going to happen that this battery here will produce an electric field in

00:30.180 --> 00:30.730
the wire.

00:30.780 --> 00:36.910
So if you look at the electric field on this section it would be in that direction if you look at the

00:36.910 --> 00:43.100
electric field over here it's in this direction and the electric field over here is in that direction

00:45.580 --> 00:50.620
other things we discuss the direction of the current the direction of the current should be in the direction

00:50.620 --> 00:52.340
of our electric field.

00:52.340 --> 00:57.760
And again here we're talking about the positive electric current and the positive electric current was

00:57.820 --> 01:02.050
actually in the opposite direction of the flow of electrons.

01:02.050 --> 01:05.890
All right if you're an electron over here and this section of the wire.

01:06.070 --> 01:11.440
Well again I don't want to go anywhere near this negative terminal because I'm also charged negatively.

01:11.440 --> 01:13.860
So I'm actually going to move in that direction.

01:13.860 --> 01:14.100
All right.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.070
So an electron

01:17.610 --> 01:21.030
actually flows in the opposite direction of the positive current.

01:21.030 --> 01:22.830
But that's kind of the same thing right.

01:22.830 --> 01:27.990
Negative charges flowing in one direction are the equivalent to having a positive current in the opposite

01:27.990 --> 01:29.060
direction.

01:29.110 --> 01:33.630
MacDraw one more electron here and again that would go in that direction.

01:33.630 --> 01:38.550
Now that's all fine and dandy but let's look at what happens inside this battery.

01:38.580 --> 01:42.880
So what is the direction of the electric field produced by the battery here inside.

01:43.200 --> 01:48.930
Well again if it goes from positive to negative inside the wire it also has to go from positive to negative

01:49.350 --> 01:51.200
inside the battery.

01:51.290 --> 01:53.110
OK.

01:53.370 --> 01:55.920
However look what happens if you're an electron over here.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.390
So you've kind of done the complete loop and then you get over here.

01:59.670 --> 02:06.750
Well you're actually quite happy to remain near this positive terminal right why would you want to go

02:06.750 --> 02:08.340
to the negative terminal.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.730
You're not going to do that by yourself.

02:10.740 --> 02:11.290
OK.

02:11.640 --> 02:16.860
It's kind of the same thing as the water fountain picture I had on the previous slide.

02:16.860 --> 02:22.380
Right once the water gets to the bottom water is quite happy to remain down there at the bottom pool.

02:22.440 --> 02:30.030
However there is a pump that actually brings the water back up and that is because something is doing

02:30.030 --> 02:37.050
work an external agent is doing work in order to bring that water bring those water droplets back to

02:37.050 --> 02:38.070
the top.

02:38.120 --> 02:44.850
It's doing work because there is the force of gravity acting down imagine here if we take this let me

02:44.850 --> 02:46.810
draw a simple water fountain over here.

02:52.650 --> 02:57.280
It won't be as decorative as the other one but let's draw water droplets.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.650
Now we know there's a force of gravity acting on that water droplets.

03:01.860 --> 03:09.200
So as it's going up there is a force of gravity acting down so there has to be a force that opposes

03:09.200 --> 03:10.650
that right.

03:10.670 --> 03:16.250
Some applied force in order to bring it back and that's the force due to the pump.

03:16.490 --> 03:23.480
Then once it gets to the top you've basically done work against the force of gravity or against gravity

03:23.480 --> 03:28.700
in order to get it there you've changed the potential energy of the water droplet.

03:29.540 --> 03:35.180
So it's kind of analogous to what's going to happen inside this battery although the electron is quite

03:35.180 --> 03:36.670
happy to remain here.

03:36.710 --> 03:38.890
There is going to be a force.

03:39.030 --> 03:44.510
It's not the force produced by this electric field there is a force acting on that charge that force

03:45.020 --> 03:49.030
as that electron moves.

03:49.250 --> 03:54.140
There is an electric force acting on it which is opposite of the electric field.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.690
This is the force produced by that electric field.

03:56.940 --> 04:01.710
So there has to be another force acting on this electron in order to move it on the other side.

04:02.160 --> 04:11.260
Let's just call that f and now this origin of this force here comes from the chemical reaction inside

04:11.260 --> 04:14.770
that battery could be some diffusion process.

04:14.860 --> 04:20.390
But basically there is a force that ends up being either at least the same size or a little bit bigger.

04:20.410 --> 04:25.900
That does work on this electron against this electric field to bring it to the negative terminal.

04:26.170 --> 04:31.210
All the details of this are really not that important for our our class over here but I just want to

04:31.210 --> 04:35.610
kind of describe the process a little bit that the battery.

04:35.620 --> 04:41.200
What it does is it does work for every single charge for every single electron it has to do work in

04:41.200 --> 04:43.420
order to bring it to the negative terminal.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.490
It's analogous to the water pump.

04:45.790 --> 04:51.760
The pump has to do work on every single water droplet in order bring it to the top and then gravity

04:51.760 --> 04:54.620
will do work to bring it back down.

04:54.820 --> 05:00.600
The amount of work done is related to the potential difference between both of those terminals.

05:00.880 --> 05:07.510
If the potential differences let's call this side here terminal a let's call this terminal B the potential

05:07.510 --> 05:10.620
differences V.A mine is VB.

05:11.040 --> 05:16.260
And this is what they call the electromotive force and we give it the letter e like this.

05:17.100 --> 05:17.670
OK.

05:17.850 --> 05:27.910
This comes in units of volts and a volt if you recall is a jewel Procul on joules are units of energy

05:27.910 --> 05:29.630
or units of work.

05:29.650 --> 05:34.760
So this is the amount of work done per unit charge.

05:34.780 --> 05:41.560
Now if you want to know how much current you get now now you can apply Ohm's law because the voltage

05:41.560 --> 05:45.880
difference now is given by this DMF of the battery.

05:45.880 --> 05:54.120
And this here must be equal to the current multiplied by the resistance and the resistance would be

05:54.120 --> 05:56.580
the resistance of this wire it could also include.

05:56.590 --> 06:02.370
There's also some internal resistance to that battery but let's just include the resistance of the wire

06:02.370 --> 06:03.060
for now.

06:03.150 --> 06:08.580
So you'd be able to solve this and obtain how much current Do I get for this value of MF.
