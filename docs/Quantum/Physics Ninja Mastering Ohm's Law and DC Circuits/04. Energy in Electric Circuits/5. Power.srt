WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:03.360
All right consider now a certain segment of wire.

00:03.810 --> 00:07.920
And we're looking at a current or charge and the charge is going to be moving.

00:07.920 --> 00:13.090
So it's initially kind of we're just looking at a particular volume here of charge.

00:13.170 --> 00:18.900
Then over time that charge moves so the way it moves it's as though you kind of took some charge from

00:18.900 --> 00:23.210
the back end of that cylinder and moved it all the way to the front.

00:23.910 --> 00:29.580
But again if there is an electric field produced in that wire which is kind of driving this charge to

00:29.580 --> 00:32.700
move it means there is a potential difference.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.520
So you have vitæ and you have a potential VB.

00:37.020 --> 00:41.040
And what you're doing is you're moving this amount of charge you're only moving a little bit of charge

00:41.040 --> 00:46.830
at a time or you're moving that a little bit of charge from the position where the potential is V.A

00:47.100 --> 00:51.510
toward a lower electrical potential toward VB.

00:51.570 --> 00:56.880
So the voltage at point A is bigger than the voltage at point B.

00:56.880 --> 01:03.780
Now if I'm moving some positive charge remember how the potential energy now is related to the voltage

01:03.780 --> 01:08.910
at any point the potential energy is given by the charge.

01:09.950 --> 01:12.790
Multiplied by the potential at that point.

01:12.800 --> 01:19.400
So what happens when you move from A to B is you go toward a lower electrical potential but really the

01:19.400 --> 01:24.070
potential energy now at a goes toward the potential energy.

01:24.110 --> 01:24.730
B.

01:24.920 --> 01:35.450
So there is a loss in potential energy.

01:35.620 --> 01:37.020
So that's important.

01:37.570 --> 01:43.110
So if you look at all the energy that is lost so you initial is at point A.

01:43.330 --> 01:46.320
Now let's look at the change in the potential energy.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.590
There is a change in potential energy when this charge moves from the back end of the cylinder through

01:50.590 --> 01:55.980
the front means we've changed the potential energy of the system.

01:55.980 --> 02:03.600
Now if you do that at a particular rate as this kind of current moves down it's as though you're always

02:03.600 --> 02:07.530
bringing in charge from the back and moving it to the front.

02:07.530 --> 02:12.010
This is done at a particular rate and this is what we call the power.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.490
The power is the rate at which you do work.

02:14.580 --> 02:19.300
And in order to move that charge from one end to the other there is work done.

02:19.310 --> 02:25.950
Now if you substitute things in here what you get is again we're reading potential energy to the voltage

02:26.280 --> 02:29.420
and the amount of charge that we're bringing over is this little bit.

02:29.420 --> 02:34.400
Delta Q and multiplied by this change in voltage.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.490
So this is actually vitæ.

02:36.780 --> 02:38.900
Mine is v.v.

02:40.080 --> 02:48.340
And again since I'm looking at a rate at which I'm changing the energy of a system you can look at you

02:48.340 --> 02:50.770
still have to divide through by this change in time.

02:50.770 --> 02:53.300
How much time does it take to do that.

02:53.410 --> 02:55.310
All right now we can combine some terms.

02:55.390 --> 02:56.490
Again V-A mine is.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.810
VB is typically what we simply call the voltage.

03:00.040 --> 03:09.160
So the power at the end ends up simply looking like this delta Q divided by Delta T and multiplied by

03:09.190 --> 03:14.890
just the voltage V where again the voltage is simply equal to V.A. mine is VB for short.

03:14.890 --> 03:17.230
It's always a difference of potential.

03:17.290 --> 03:25.750
Now Delta Q over delta T that is the definition of our current and v is the potential difference across

03:25.750 --> 03:27.450
two points that we're looking at.

03:28.950 --> 03:30.850
So here is a power equation.

03:32.320 --> 03:40.510
It's the rate at which there's either work done by the battery or it's the rate at which energy is getting

03:40.510 --> 03:43.390
dissipated in a resistor.

03:43.650 --> 03:48.540
If we look at the units of this current multiplied by voltage.

03:48.540 --> 03:56.490
So let's look at the units of our power units of current and cool ohms per second that's an AMPS multiplied

03:56.490 --> 03:58.710
by Jewel Procul.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.970
That's the units of voltage.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.990
And at the n cool ohms cancel out.

04:04.230 --> 04:09.420
And what you're left with here are units of Joule per second.

04:10.130 --> 04:15.760
And this is what we call a watt one joule per second is equivalent to 1 watt.

04:15.960 --> 04:20.710
So the units of power are Joule per second.

04:22.400 --> 04:30.870
Which is equivalent to what's OK so this is kind of an important equation.

04:31.050 --> 04:35.150
Now it really can be written in three different forms this power equation.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.270
So let's have a look at that.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.850
So this is kind of one form.

04:38.850 --> 04:45.990
Now you you combine this with Ohm's Law Ohm's law if you remember said that voltage is related to the

04:45.990 --> 04:49.750
current by the resistance.

04:49.750 --> 04:49.960
Right.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.780
We had this equation here for Ohm's law.

04:53.850 --> 04:55.780
Again we have the three variables.

04:55.890 --> 05:01.110
And the way it's written now in the black box over here is it doesn't include the value of the resistance.

05:02.500 --> 05:09.100
However if I substitute V into my power equation what I'm going to get is a slightly different form

05:09.100 --> 05:11.320
so let me write it down over here.

05:11.460 --> 05:18.760
It's the same equation but you just substitute V using Ohm's law and what you find is it's you're going

05:18.760 --> 05:19.310
to get I.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.130
You're going to get another.

05:20.130 --> 05:21.850
I found that V.

05:21.850 --> 05:28.990
So the power equation can sometimes be written like this and it can also be written by eliminating the

05:28.990 --> 05:29.700
current.

05:29.950 --> 05:36.160
I can eliminate the current by using Ohm's law by substituting the current in my power equation by V

05:36.160 --> 05:37.170
divided by R.

05:37.170 --> 05:44.160
And if I do that the power here can be written as the squared over are.

05:44.170 --> 05:47.850
So here are kind of two other forms of writing the exact same equation.

05:49.810 --> 05:56.320
There are some cases where this form might be kind of more convenient we'll see and simple circuits

05:56.320 --> 06:02.080
that I kind of like this form if I'm looking at the power being delivered by the battery I usually can

06:02.080 --> 06:06.410
figure out how much current is flowing through the battery and I usually know what the voltages are

06:06.430 --> 06:08.260
what the IAM method the battery is.

06:08.260 --> 06:15.190
So this is very easy to calculate when I'm looking at resistors if I'm looking at resistors you typically

06:15.190 --> 06:21.370
know the value of R and then we'll have tricks to help us find what the current is so these forms are

06:21.370 --> 06:28.420
kind of good but it's also you know we have to remember that the voltage here always means the voltage

06:28.420 --> 06:30.680
across the element that we're looking at.

06:30.940 --> 06:34.300
If you're looking at a resistor it's the voltage across the resistor.

06:34.390 --> 06:38.050
If you're looking at an IMF it's the IMF or the battery.
