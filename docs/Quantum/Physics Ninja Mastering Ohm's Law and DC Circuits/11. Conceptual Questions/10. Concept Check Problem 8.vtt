I concept check a light bulb is connected to the battery is shown here and figure a one a second bulb

00:05.280 --> 00:10.190
is connected like in figure B what happens to the brightness of the original bulb.

00:10.620 --> 00:12.820
OK you are comparing A to B.

00:12.830 --> 00:16.030
Those the original bulb increase decrease they the same.

00:16.030 --> 00:16.540
Go out.

00:16.540 --> 00:18.420
Are you unable to determine.

00:18.870 --> 00:19.620
So again.

00:19.740 --> 00:22.560
Well we could just calculate the current in each case.

00:22.560 --> 00:24.160
This one is pretty straightforward.

00:24.370 --> 00:25.710
Just assume you have some.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.920
Again we're considering ideal cases here.

00:28.110 --> 00:36.330
So the amount of current you get for Case Number one given by Ohm's law you should get v over are.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.260
Now what do you get in the second case if you connect another bulb and let's assume that it's identical.

00:41.640 --> 00:46.890
Well again if you do the same loop is what you previously did you're going to get that the current again

00:46.920 --> 00:47.840
through this one.

00:47.850 --> 00:54.170
Call it I one is going to be a battery divided by the value of the resistance.

00:54.510 --> 01:02.070
You're also going to find that the current Aitu through the top bulb is also going to be the same and

01:02.070 --> 01:04.540
it's the same as the first case.

01:04.670 --> 01:07.980
Right because we have an ideal powers apply here.

01:07.980 --> 01:14.100
So at the end of the day the bulb brightness has to be the same for every bulb in this configuration

01:14.100 --> 01:14.690
here.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.890
So what happens to the original bulb.

01:16.890 --> 01:20.400
The best answer here is stays the same.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.320
In the ideal case which you end up doing since the currents are always the same you just end up getting

01:25.320 --> 01:28.110
more current flowing through this battery.

01:28.110 --> 01:32.870
So the battery has to do more work on these charges.

01:32.880 --> 01:36.710
Right so there's more power being supplied by the battery to light up.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.710
Both of these bulbs.
