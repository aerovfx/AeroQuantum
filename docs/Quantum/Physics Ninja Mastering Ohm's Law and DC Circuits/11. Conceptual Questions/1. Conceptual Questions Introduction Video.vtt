Hi everybody and welcome to the conceptual problem set here.

00:03.830 --> 00:05.670
So I've got a whole series of problems.

00:05.760 --> 00:11.520
The first part includes just power supplies and resistors or light bulbs and in the second part there

00:11.510 --> 00:17.620
are seven questions based on adding capacitors in there and more conceptual style problems.

00:17.970 --> 00:22.140
Although their conceptual style problems feel free to write down equations and use what you learned

00:22.140 --> 00:24.900
to try to figure out what the answer is.

00:24.990 --> 00:29.310
In most cases you can assume that the power supplies of the batteries are ideal.

00:29.310 --> 00:31.940
However I think there's two problems.

00:32.010 --> 00:37.470
Five and six that you may have to include a tiny internal resistance because you might find that if

00:37.470 --> 00:42.750
you apply Kirchoff's rules and you try to argue you're going to run into a few problems and you know

00:42.750 --> 00:45.090
you'll see the solutions later on.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.750
Good luck with these problems folks.

00:46.770 --> 00:51.840
Again if you have any questions or leave a comment maybe I'll try to explain it slightly differently

00:51.840 --> 00:53.110
than what I did in the video.

00:53.160 --> 00:53.390
OK.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.620
Good luck guys.
