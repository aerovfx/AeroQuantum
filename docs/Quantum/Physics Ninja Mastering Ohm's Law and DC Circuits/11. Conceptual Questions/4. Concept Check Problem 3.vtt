All writers problem three says consider the Surtur below which resistor has the largest power consumption

00:06.510 --> 00:09.660
so which one dissipates the most amount of power.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.490
This is kind of a good problem here.

00:12.660 --> 00:17.550
So if we're talking about power dissipated by resistance again power equation you can read three different

00:17.550 --> 00:18.180
ways right.

00:18.180 --> 00:24.330
That was the one way we can write it as are-I squared I was also another way and we can also write it

00:24.330 --> 00:27.260
as V squared over our.

00:27.270 --> 00:30.360
So let's start comparing them so we got to compare the three.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.390
I don't want to do I don't want to solve for the entire circuit.

00:33.480 --> 00:37.440
All we have to do is determine which one has the largest We don't actually have to do any math that

00:37.440 --> 00:39.440
we don't want to know the actual value of it.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.680
We just want to know which one is the biggest.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.180
So let's first compare 10 to 1000.

00:45.240 --> 00:45.960
Right.

00:45.960 --> 00:53.650
One thing we know is that the voltage between points Biondi right the voltage between the Point B and

00:53.660 --> 01:00.540
D should be the same as the voltage between Point B and C because both of these are in parallel with

01:00.540 --> 01:01.500
each other.

01:01.620 --> 01:06.580
So that must be equal to the voltage between Point B and C..

01:06.630 --> 01:11.980
So actually if you use now this for use the equation that I wrote.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.130
Let's get this equation over here.

01:14.340 --> 01:19.750
Remember V here is the voltage across that resistor R is the value of the resistance.

01:19.800 --> 01:25.710
So if you compare the power across the 10 arm resistance what you would do is you would say all the

01:25.710 --> 01:27.080
power.

01:27.390 --> 01:34.080
You're right the the power dissipated in this 10 ohm resistance is equal to the voltage across that

01:34.080 --> 01:35.700
10 ohm resistance.

01:35.730 --> 01:38.700
That's what we called the VB D.

01:38.790 --> 01:40.240
You've got to square that value.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.540
And now you divide it by 10.

01:43.080 --> 01:48.510
If you compare it now to the power dissipated by the thousand ohm resistor Well you'd get the voltage

01:48.510 --> 01:54.980
across a thousand words actually the same as this one the voltage B.C which is the same divided now

01:55.050 --> 01:57.980
by 10 is divided by a thousand.

01:58.020 --> 02:06.040
So you automatically see that the 10 home definitely dissipates more energy than a thousand home because

02:06.040 --> 02:08.710
I'm dividing by a much smaller number here.

02:09.400 --> 02:09.700
OK.

02:09.700 --> 02:12.230
So we got this guys the winner between both of those.

02:12.250 --> 02:17.680
Now we have to compare the power dissipated between the 50 and the 10.

02:17.740 --> 02:19.540
So what's the best way of looking at this.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.290
Well you know the current is going to be different.

02:22.310 --> 02:27.760
Right so you have current that's going to flow in here and call it current I and then we have a junction

02:27.760 --> 02:28.690
over here.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.250
So what happens to that current.

02:30.460 --> 02:33.320
Well part of the current is going to flow down here.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.290
Let's call that one.

02:35.560 --> 02:41.340
And part of the current is going to flow through the thousand Let's call this Aitu.

02:41.350 --> 02:45.790
Now you should know from that junction rule that whatever flows into the junction has to be what's flowing

02:45.790 --> 02:46.450
out.

02:46.660 --> 02:52.750
Therefore from that I think you should conclude that the current I must be bigger than the current one

02:54.250 --> 02:59.570
right because we know that I has to be equal to I one plus two.

03:00.010 --> 03:03.580
And since there is only a single power supply you know the current is going to flow in this direction

03:03.580 --> 03:05.520
here and then go back.

03:05.530 --> 03:05.830
All right.

03:05.830 --> 03:11.800
So if you can understand this part I think now we just go back to our power equations now for this problem

03:11.800 --> 03:16.780
here it's probably a little bit easier to use this equation over here.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.430
Again it doesn't matter which one you use there.

03:18.430 --> 03:20.770
I'll give you the same answer however.

03:21.220 --> 03:25.580
Now we're going to compare the value of the resistance and the current flowing through it.

03:25.660 --> 03:28.690
So let's compare the 50 ohm versus the 10.

03:29.040 --> 03:35.590
So the power dissipated in the 50 ohm resistor you would read like this it's 50 multiplied by the current

03:35.620 --> 03:37.030
How much current is flowing through it.

03:37.030 --> 03:37.910
I label that.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.140
And that's squared.

03:40.150 --> 03:43.770
Now I want to compare this to the 10 ohm resistance.

03:43.900 --> 03:44.500
So what do we get.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.610
We get 10.

03:45.610 --> 03:49.700
Now it's the current going through it is I won.

03:49.900 --> 03:51.730
So let's compare both of these things.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.970
Well the resistance is bigger here.

03:53.980 --> 03:56.220
It's bigger than 10 so that number is bigger.

03:56.350 --> 04:02.290
And we also know from what we have over here about our current that the current eye is also bigger.

04:02.290 --> 04:05.620
So if I square it it's certainly going to be better.

04:05.930 --> 04:06.400
OK.

04:06.520 --> 04:15.310
So the largest power consumption then certainly has to be the 50 ohm has the largest value of the resistance

04:15.580 --> 04:17.170
between the 50 and that in the tenth.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.780
And we know that the currents are also going to be bigger.

04:19.840 --> 04:26.920
So 50 is the biggest or the most power dissipated in that 50 ohm resistance so choice number one is

04:26.920 --> 04:28.020
the correct answer for this one.
