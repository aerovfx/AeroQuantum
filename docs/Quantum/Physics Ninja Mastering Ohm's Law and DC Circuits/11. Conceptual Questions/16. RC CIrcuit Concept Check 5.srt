00:00.090 --> 00:05.730
All right here is content check five for RC circuits again same circuit as before or we're going to

00:05.730 --> 00:09.300
do now is what does the current through the capacitor.

00:09.300 --> 00:15.330
Well through the capacitor is it a little bit of kind of maybe not the best term to use here.

00:15.330 --> 00:20.080
Well we're asking for is it what is the the rate of change of the charger and what's the current in

00:20.100 --> 00:22.470
kind of this section over here.

00:23.100 --> 00:27.720
Just after you close the switch again the key to all these problems here is in the short time limit

00:27.720 --> 00:34.590
what you do is you just short off the capacitor or you just replace it with a wire.

00:34.710 --> 00:41.340
And now if you want to determine the current out here what we could do now is basically this outer branch

00:41.340 --> 00:43.380
has a resistance of zero.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.320
This other branches middle branch here has a resistance of two homes.

00:47.370 --> 00:54.670
So what happens when you kind of group them up had these basically behave like an effective resistance.

00:54.670 --> 00:59.930
And what's the value if there's two of them right the equivalent resistance if there's two you end up

00:59.930 --> 01:06.820
multiplying so you get two times zero divided by the sum two plus zero equals zero.

01:06.920 --> 01:07.240
Right.

01:07.250 --> 01:13.370
Basically all the current that comes into this junction Well it's going to go through the path of least

01:13.370 --> 01:14.570
resistance.

01:14.630 --> 01:18.190
It's going to go toward the capacitor initially.

01:18.590 --> 01:20.510
Why would it want to go through the two home.

01:20.540 --> 01:20.780
Right.

01:20.780 --> 01:26.130
That's more resistance initially going out in this outer branch.

01:26.140 --> 01:32.320
So all we have to do now is if we can determine how much current flows through the battery and across

01:32.320 --> 01:37.390
the 1 ohm resistor all that current initially is going to go toward this outer branch.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.010
OK.

01:38.110 --> 01:43.810
In order to do that all you have to do is apply Ohm's Law use LOOP rule and let's go around this outer

01:43.810 --> 01:44.950
branch.

01:44.950 --> 01:48.310
So the first thing I encounter is a 6 volt battery.

01:48.310 --> 01:54.460
The next thing I encounter now is a 1 ohm resistor and I'm going to get a voltage drop across that resistor

01:54.520 --> 01:59.160
and that's going to be equal to our I.

01:59.190 --> 02:03.960
So the resistance is one and the current is I and that's it.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.880
Now I'm at this point and now I keep going all the way around this outer branch but there's no resistance

02:08.880 --> 02:09.860
here initially.

02:10.670 --> 02:12.930
And then I go back to where I started.

02:12.940 --> 02:13.980
That's it.

02:13.980 --> 02:19.550
So the current at the end of the day six stamps is the correct answer.

02:19.560 --> 02:27.600
Again this is in the short time limit here where the capacitor behaves like a just resistance with or

02:27.630 --> 02:29.030
no resistance.

02:29.140 --> 02:29.560
Right.

02:29.610 --> 02:30.210
It shorted.
