All right concept ject 7 for RC circuits consider these two circuits over here.

00:05.670 --> 00:12.040
So same voltage different values of the resistance and same capacitance.

00:12.090 --> 00:17.130
So batteries and capacitors are identical then you are going to close the switch.

00:17.160 --> 00:20.740
Let's go ahead do that for a very long time.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.880
To close a switch for a really long time.

00:23.880 --> 00:27.140
However at Teagle zero we open them again.

00:27.150 --> 00:27.870
Let me get rid of that.

00:27.870 --> 00:32.410
So first of all let's first see what happens after we've closed them for a long time.

00:32.420 --> 00:35.930
All right because we're going to end up charging both of those capacitors.

00:36.540 --> 00:42.420
So after a long time again the voltage Now what voltage do you think you would get after a long time

00:42.420 --> 00:45.410
again the voltage across each branch has to be the same.

00:45.540 --> 00:49.790
And after a while you're not going to have any current So there's no more voltage drop after a long

00:49.780 --> 00:53.640
time across the one arm and the form resistor.

00:53.640 --> 01:01.320
So that means that this is basically going to start with a voltage equal to six volts so you got this

01:01.320 --> 01:05.450
part at least initially.

01:08.170 --> 01:08.950
Same for both.

01:08.950 --> 01:12.720
Right it doesn't matter because we've waited a long time.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.460
OK now we're going to open the switch.

01:15.460 --> 01:18.180
So think about what happens when we open the switch.

01:18.190 --> 01:23.440
Well basically all we have here is going to be a small little circuit here.

01:24.540 --> 01:27.320
And this branch after we open the switch.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.280
All right in both cases this is the only thing we're really concerned about.

01:31.280 --> 01:31.640
All right.

01:31.660 --> 01:37.270
Is going to be what's going to happen here on the right hand side because we've opened the switch can't

01:37.270 --> 01:39.720
be any current flowing over there.

01:40.870 --> 01:42.880
OK so think about what happens here.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.830
So let's look at all the choices here says the resistors and this circuit here dissipate more energy

01:48.670 --> 01:51.160
and the resistors and B dissipate more energy.

01:51.220 --> 01:56.450
Both pairs of resistor Well look at they have different total effective resistance right.

01:56.470 --> 02:03.040
The equivalent resistance of circuit A is three ohms this one here and circuit B is 6 ohms right so

02:03.040 --> 02:05.740
we have a bigger value of a resistance.

02:06.070 --> 02:12.070
Both pairs of resistors dissipate the same amount of energy or we can't determine again whatever the

02:12.070 --> 02:20.240
voltages for both of these cases the potential energy stored in a capacitor is given by one half C-v

02:20.260 --> 02:21.990
squared.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.570
C is the same for both of them.

02:24.610 --> 02:31.390
So that means that the energy stored in this one has to be equal to the energy stored in the first one.

02:31.480 --> 02:35.470
The voltage is going to be the same six of all the capacitance is the same.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.810
We start with the same amount of energy.

02:37.870 --> 02:43.510
Now again all of that energy is effectively you know if you leave this open now for a very long time

02:44.320 --> 02:48.490
all of this energy gets dissipated by these resistors.

02:48.490 --> 02:50.910
Now that's going to happen at a different rate.

02:51.010 --> 02:53.230
So the power would be different.

02:53.290 --> 02:59.080
However the total amount of energy that's going to be dissipated is going to be the same because they

02:59.080 --> 03:04.900
started off with the same value and all that energy gets dissipated in the resistors.

03:04.960 --> 03:10.750
So really the best choice here is that both pairs the same amount of energy they do it at a different

03:10.750 --> 03:16.360
rate because they have a different value of effective resistance.

03:16.390 --> 03:22.840
They have a different RC time constant which will impact the rate at which the dissipation happens however

03:22.840 --> 03:24.760
it's the same amount of total energy.
