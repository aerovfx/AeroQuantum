All right here's our first RC circuit concept check question it says consider this circuit over here.

00:05.760 --> 00:09.510
We have power supply to them resistors capacitors switch.

00:09.750 --> 00:15.930
Consider the circuit below the switch S is close that time equals to zero so close that up over here.

00:15.990 --> 00:20.670
Boehme What is the voltage across this capacitor over here.

00:20.670 --> 00:24.800
Just after you close the switch and you get all these choices.

00:24.810 --> 00:27.770
0 9 volt none of the above are impossible to determine.

00:27.780 --> 00:30.570
Well the key to this problem here.

00:30.810 --> 00:36.390
Again if they don't tell you that what the charges I guess maybe should have put that in there but you

00:36.390 --> 00:42.210
can probably safely assume that the initial charge on the capacitor most capacitors if it does grab

00:42.210 --> 00:45.410
them you put them in a circuit they're probably uncharged.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.400
OK.

00:46.770 --> 00:52.470
So if it's on charge remember the relationship between the charge and the voltage across the plates

00:52.890 --> 00:55.590
is simply given by this expression over here.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.530
So if initially there is no charge.

00:57.540 --> 01:01.750
Again it's going to take a bit of time before a charge starts accumulating on there.

01:01.860 --> 01:08.520
Right it doesn't go from zero charge to its maximum value instantaneously.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.650
So since the charge is zero that means that the only way the charge is zero is if the potential across

01:13.650 --> 01:14.790
the plates is zero.

01:14.880 --> 01:20.040
So this is kind of just they just a quick check see if you remember stuff about capacitors.
