A writer's concept check for the same circuit as before but the question is a little bit different says

00:05.790 --> 00:08.660
consider the circuit here which statement is correct.

00:08.910 --> 00:15.690
So there's three statements that says that the current in the segment A B is equal to the current in

00:15.690 --> 00:17.660
B and B c.

00:17.670 --> 00:21.900
So here's the segment ab so we can call this current over here.

00:22.410 --> 00:30.640
Let's call it I A B and then we're going to call this current down over here in this branch.

00:30.690 --> 00:37.390
Here's the current IBD and here's the current and this branch through the thousand ohm resistor.

00:37.470 --> 00:41.800
This here's the current b c OK and we know here we have a junction rule.

00:42.140 --> 00:46.730
And the other two statements simply tell you that they compare the currents that compare the current

00:46.730 --> 00:51.250
through the 10 home and then compare it to the current in 1000 ohm resistor.

00:51.290 --> 00:52.460
So which statement is correct.

00:52.460 --> 00:57.890
Well again you would probably start by writing the junction rule and you could see that statement 1.

00:57.980 --> 00:59.640
It really is the junction.

00:59.640 --> 01:02.710
All right that's Kirchoff's current law right.

01:02.720 --> 01:09.120
The junction will whatever curve flows into the junction has to be the current flowing out of the junction.

01:09.140 --> 01:10.380
So definitely one.

01:10.380 --> 01:15.230
All right so we can actually eliminate some choices right to only Knobe three only.

01:15.230 --> 01:17.090
So one has to be in there.

01:17.090 --> 01:22.070
So it's either one by itself or it's one in one of these other two choices.

01:22.070 --> 01:28.010
So let's compare these other two choices compare the current through the 10 ohm and the current through

01:28.010 --> 01:30.010
the thousand ohm.

01:30.050 --> 01:37.460
Now the one thing we should know is that the voltage between points again voltage between points Biondi

01:38.090 --> 01:44.720
must be equal to the voltage between Point B and C and that is because they are in parallel with each

01:44.720 --> 01:45.580
other.

01:46.180 --> 01:52.030
If you have two resistors in parallel the voltage across each one must be the same.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.700
So now let's just carry this out.

01:53.690 --> 02:01.300
The voltage across the resistor simply 10 multiplied by the current going through it.

02:01.330 --> 02:08.560
BD and this here must be equal to the voltage across the thousand ohm resistor Well that's the value

02:08.560 --> 02:12.510
of the resistance multiplied by the current flowing through it.

02:12.550 --> 02:16.990
B C So automatically you see that the current.

02:16.990 --> 02:20.380
Now if you look at the statements over here they say one is bigger than the other.

02:20.590 --> 02:25.120
Well think about it if you're current over here there's going to be way more current flowing through

02:25.120 --> 02:28.180
the 10 ohm resistor than the thousand ohm resistor.

02:28.180 --> 02:30.950
There's a little less resistance over here right.

02:31.060 --> 02:35.710
And that's what this equation tells us it tells us that the current B-D if you bring the 10 on the other

02:35.710 --> 02:40.990
side it's going to be a hundred times the current through B C.

02:40.990 --> 02:47.970
So the real statement here is the current here must be bigger than the current b c.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.480
So there are two statements that are correct.

02:51.520 --> 02:57.480
The first one in question to you over here or sorry statement number two over here is also correct.

02:57.490 --> 03:00.380
So one and two are correct.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.370
Three is incorrect.
