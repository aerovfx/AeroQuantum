Art here's RC circuit cons object number four because consider the following circuit here on the right

00:04.620 --> 00:07.260
hand side looking a little bit more complicated.

00:07.290 --> 00:09.330
The switch is close and close that up here.

00:09.330 --> 00:10.620
Time equals zero.

00:10.740 --> 00:17.330
They ask What is the voltage across the capacitor just after you close the switch and 0 through 9 volts.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.510
Missin a few here.

00:18.510 --> 00:21.200
None of the above are impossible to determine.

00:21.200 --> 00:21.760
All right.

00:21.780 --> 00:27.960
The key to this problem again is just after you close the switch Well you know initially it's uncharged.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.910
So the initial charge is zero.

00:30.180 --> 00:36.420
We always have to have this relationship for any capacitor you have that the charge is directly proportional

00:36.420 --> 00:37.840
to the voltage.

00:38.010 --> 00:44.350
If the charge initially is zero that means that the voltage initially has to be zero across those plates.

00:44.770 --> 00:45.270
OK.

00:45.450 --> 00:47.130
So that's it.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.560
Zero is the correct answer for this guy.
