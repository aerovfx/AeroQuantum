00:00.300 --> 00:05.940
Various concept checks sic says we have a battery here that's used to light up this bulb is shown and

00:05.940 --> 00:09.620
then an identical battery is connected on the other side and then you close the switch.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.250
Then what happens to the bulb.

00:11.610 --> 00:16.470
So before there is certainly a current over here and going through it I mean just write this out before

00:16.470 --> 00:21.500
closing the switch right before this battery year as a potential V.

00:21.510 --> 00:22.680
This here has a resistance.

00:22.690 --> 00:29.460
Are you plie liberal to that you're going to find there's a current going through it given by this.

00:29.460 --> 00:29.720
All right.

00:29.730 --> 00:34.450
So it has a certain brightness based on this current now after what happens.

00:34.460 --> 00:40.380
Well so after all we're going to close our switch make a connection over here again with an identical

00:40.380 --> 00:40.910
battery.

00:40.920 --> 00:47.970
So let's do this now let's try to apply a loop rule around this older loop and see what happens you're

00:47.970 --> 00:50.440
going to see there's a problem now in this problem.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.520
So let's go around the first thing I encounter is Plez V.

00:53.550 --> 00:58.560
When I go across the battery like this then I go around the outer loop and I cross this other battery

00:58.650 --> 01:02.030
right over here and now I get another plus V.

01:02.250 --> 01:03.810
And then I go back to where I started.

01:03.810 --> 01:06.590
So I say well yeah that has to be equal to zero.

01:06.810 --> 01:11.200
Then you do this and whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what's going on here.

01:11.340 --> 01:11.770
Right.

01:11.820 --> 01:18.120
The only way you could satisfy this equation over here the way I did it is a V was equal to zero.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.090
However we know it's not equal to zero.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.300
So there's a problem here right.

01:21.300 --> 01:29.220
This is kind of impossible right because we know we have a battery that has a voltage yet when we apply

01:29.220 --> 01:32.160
Kirchhoff's loop will we get that the voltage has to be equal to zero.

01:32.160 --> 01:37.110
And the problem is this problem is kind of a trap.

01:37.110 --> 01:44.820
The only way you can have this is some problems you really cannot ignore the internal resistance of

01:44.820 --> 01:48.000
a battery and this is one of them.

01:48.600 --> 01:54.210
OK so we really have to include whenever you run into problems when you apply Kirchoff's laws and you

01:54.210 --> 02:00.660
see that the current sort of the voltage has to be zero it seems to be like an impossible situation.

02:00.710 --> 02:05.490
It's because you really have to include the internal resistance so let's do that now so I'm going to

02:05.490 --> 02:08.580
call that internal resistance little are OK.

02:08.730 --> 02:12.340
And now let's apply some of our rules so let's label some of the currents.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.280
We're going to keep the current down the center.

02:14.280 --> 02:21.630
We're going to still call that I call the current now and this branch and I call this one and then I'll

02:21.630 --> 02:25.920
call the current in this outer branch on the right hand side Aitu.

02:25.980 --> 02:31.540
Now we can apply Kirchhoff's rules and we'll get to a solution.

02:31.710 --> 02:32.920
So let's see what happens now.

02:32.940 --> 02:36.560
Here we have a junction so we can say whatever goes into the junction.

02:36.870 --> 02:44.090
We have a current one going into the junction plus current I going into the junction equals the Aitu

02:44.100 --> 02:46.480
there's one equation.

02:46.860 --> 02:52.290
Another equation I can get now is well you can apply loop rules right.

02:52.290 --> 02:55.290
We can apply loop rules let's go around kind of both sides.

02:55.290 --> 02:59.260
So let me start out here and go around.

02:59.550 --> 03:01.670
So first thing on counter-battery V.

03:01.830 --> 03:08.140
Now I get a voltage drop across this internal resistance that's given by this.

03:08.460 --> 03:13.140
And now I'm going across the resistor except I'm crossing it in the opposite direction of the current.

03:13.230 --> 03:14.860
So you have to have this.

03:15.270 --> 03:17.430
Then I go back to where I start.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.700
Now I have three unknown so I really need three equations over here.

03:20.700 --> 03:26.460
So again we're going to use another loop rule you can use another loop rule here say going around this

03:26.460 --> 03:31.890
right hand side you're going to get something similar you get v you get minus the different current.

03:31.890 --> 03:33.380
Now to our.

03:33.720 --> 03:41.970
And now I'm going through this middle resistance so I'm going to get minus i r equals zero.

03:42.600 --> 03:46.390
All right when I'm first going to do here let's manipulate equations 2 and 3.

03:46.740 --> 03:53.790
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to subtract them now I'm going to do equation 2 minus equation

03:53.820 --> 03:54.320
3.

03:54.510 --> 03:58.490
And if I do that you see the v's are going to cancel out here if I subtract them.

03:58.560 --> 03:59.320
So let's do that.

03:59.310 --> 04:00.160
So I get minus.

04:00.180 --> 04:09.900
I want our Plus I are then if I subtract this I end up switching the signs over here plus two are and

04:09.900 --> 04:13.200
plus I are equal to zero.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.070
Now you can group some of the terms together you know all the facts.

04:17.100 --> 04:23.580
The internal resistance for this term plus two are two are rather.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.360
That has to be equal to zero.

04:25.700 --> 04:30.770
Now I'm almost done see this term over here the second term is I to mine is one.

04:30.930 --> 04:36.220
So I eliminate that and I'm going to eliminate that using my junction rule.

04:36.680 --> 04:45.590
You can see here that I two minus one as to be equal to the current I OK.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.040
So substitute that in here.

04:47.040 --> 04:47.870
So what are you going to get.

04:47.910 --> 04:58.580
I multiply by that tiny little resistance internal resistance of each B plus two are equal zero.

04:58.880 --> 05:05.050
So if you factor out the IO which you end up getting is R plus two times are equals zero.

05:05.490 --> 05:09.610
So how is this possible what value of current with satisfied as it is.

05:09.660 --> 05:14.440
There's only one right these guys are finite values resistance.

05:14.520 --> 05:20.260
I'm the one who pick which lay ball by substituting two there and this is a property of the battery.

05:20.280 --> 05:25.550
So the only way I can satisfy this equation is if that current equals to zero.

05:26.370 --> 05:32.250
OK so we initially had some current flowing through it and now the current AI has to be able to zero

05:33.450 --> 05:35.610
if that current equals to zero.

05:35.610 --> 05:38.660
That means it's going to go out.

05:38.730 --> 05:42.800
So actually number one is the correct answer over here.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.060
Now let's think about what else happens now.

05:45.090 --> 05:49.290
So if the current goes to zero look at this term let's look at our junction table.

05:49.450 --> 05:54.090
All right if I equals to zero just get rid of it that means that the current and these the branches

05:54.360 --> 05:56.560
are going to be the same.

05:56.610 --> 05:58.400
I want Eagles to Itu

06:01.050 --> 06:05.640
and now I just want you to examine how what happens to the current and why you would probably never

06:05.640 --> 06:07.860
really wanted to do this in real life.

06:07.860 --> 06:08.600
Let's have a look at it.

06:08.590 --> 06:11.550
So we know the current Now there's nothing going it's not on branch.

06:11.640 --> 06:15.740
All that current's going around this outer loop like this.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.930
Let's find how much courage do we actually have.

06:20.030 --> 06:20.450
OK.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.890
Again we find that we can use any of these equations here you can use either this one or you can use

06:24.890 --> 06:25.720
this one.

06:26.000 --> 06:34.250
Let's use this equation to so equation 2 tells us that Bolch minus Iowa and our little are.

06:34.660 --> 06:39.980
And now I don't have to worry about the second terms and there's no current flowing through that middle

06:40.020 --> 06:43.610
resistor so that there has to be equal to zero.

06:44.060 --> 06:48.770
So what are we going to get at the current and those outer branches is the battery which whatever it

06:48.770 --> 06:53.570
is 9 volts 1.5 volts divided by the internal resistance.

06:55.050 --> 06:56.700
I see what happens.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.690
This is typically pretty small.

06:59.930 --> 07:05.570
Ideally you want to make the internal resistance as small as possible so you can imagine if I divide

07:05.570 --> 07:13.400
by a small number this current I y is going to be big OK.

07:14.020 --> 07:19.120
And actually that's why you really want to do that because you're going to generate quite a lot of current

07:19.120 --> 07:21.940
yet and Currence going to flow through that bulb.

07:21.940 --> 07:29.410
And if I generate a lot of current You have to have a voltage drop across these tiny resistors.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.210
All right.

07:30.210 --> 07:32.410
So that's it for or 6.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.950
A little bit trickier.

07:33.970 --> 07:39.170
Again I just want to point out that some that really do have to include internal resistance otherwise.

07:39.290 --> 07:42.660
And you can always set it to zero at the end and then kind of see what happens.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.310
But just think clued in then at the end set it to zero and take that limit.
