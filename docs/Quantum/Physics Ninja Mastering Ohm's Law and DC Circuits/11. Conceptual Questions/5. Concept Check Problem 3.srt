All writers problem three says consider this Surtur below which resistor has the largest power consumption

00:06.570 --> 00:09.720
so which one dissipates the most amount of power.

00:09.780 --> 00:12.460
This is kind of a good problem here.

00:12.720 --> 00:17.370
So if we're talking about a power dissipated by resistance again power equation you can write three

00:17.370 --> 00:18.260
different ways right.

00:18.270 --> 00:24.840
That was a one way we can write it as our squared was also another way and we can also write it as V

00:24.840 --> 00:27.160
squared over r.

00:27.330 --> 00:30.440
So let's start comparing them so we got to compare the three.

00:30.450 --> 00:33.460
I don't want to do I don't want to solve for the entire circuit.

00:33.570 --> 00:37.500
All we have to do is determine which one has the largest We don't actually have to do any math.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.530
We don't want to know the actual value of it.

00:39.570 --> 00:41.560
We just want to know which one is the biggest.

00:41.850 --> 00:45.320
So let's first compare 10 to 1000.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.030
Right.

00:46.050 --> 00:53.730
One thing we know is that the voltage between points B and D right the voltage between the Point B and

00:53.720 --> 01:00.630
D should be the same as the voltage between Point B and C because both of these are in parallel with

01:00.630 --> 01:01.580
each other.

01:01.710 --> 01:06.670
So that must be equal to the voltage between Point B and C..

01:06.720 --> 01:12.300
So actually if you use now this for Use the third equation that I wrote I.

01:12.340 --> 01:18.360
At this equation over here remember V here is the voltage across that resistor R is the value of the

01:18.360 --> 01:19.840
resistance.

01:19.890 --> 01:25.770
So if you compare the power across the 10 arm resistance what you would do is you would say all the

01:25.770 --> 01:27.250
power.

01:27.560 --> 01:34.590
You're right the power dissipated in this 10 arm resistance is equal to the voltage across that 10 ohm

01:34.590 --> 01:35.760
resistance.

01:35.790 --> 01:38.710
That's what we called VBIED.

01:38.850 --> 01:40.250
You've got to square that value.

01:40.410 --> 01:46.880
And now you divide it by 10 if you'd compare it now to the power dissipated by the thousand ohm resistor

01:47.340 --> 01:49.680
Well you'd get the voltage across a thousand.

01:49.690 --> 01:56.340
It's actually the same as this one so the voltage B.C which is the same divided now by not 10 is divided

01:56.340 --> 01:57.670
by a thousand.

01:58.080 --> 02:06.130
So you automatically see that the 10 ohm definitely dissipates more energy than a thousand on me because

02:06.130 --> 02:09.330
I'm dividing by a much smaller number here.

02:09.460 --> 02:09.750
OK.

02:09.760 --> 02:12.330
So we've got this guy is the winner between both of those.

02:12.340 --> 02:17.750
Now we have to compare the power dissipated between the 50 and the 10.

02:17.800 --> 02:19.660
So what's the best way of looking at this.

02:19.660 --> 02:22.370
Well you know the current is going to be different.

02:22.400 --> 02:22.630
Right.

02:22.630 --> 02:27.820
So you have current that's going to flow in here it's call it current AI and then we have a junction

02:27.820 --> 02:28.730
over here.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.320
So what happens to that current.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.500
Well part of the current is going to flow down here.

02:33.730 --> 02:38.560
Let's call that one and part of the current is going to flow through the thousand.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.300
Let's call this Aitu.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.850
Now you should know from that junction rule that whatever flows into the junction has to be what's flowing

02:45.850 --> 02:46.750
out.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.720
Therefore from that I think you should conclude that the current.

02:49.750 --> 02:58.780
I must be bigger than the current one right because we know that I have to be equal to I one plus I

02:58.780 --> 03:02.980
had to write and since there's only a single power is applied you know the current is going to flow

03:02.980 --> 03:05.040
in this direction here and then go back.

03:05.590 --> 03:05.920
All right.

03:05.920 --> 03:11.890
So if you can understand this part I think now we just go back to our power equations now for this problem

03:11.890 --> 03:16.860
here it's probably a little bit easier to use this equation over here.

03:16.870 --> 03:20.020
Again it doesn't matter which one you use there I'll give you the same answer.

03:20.020 --> 03:25.310
However now we're going to compare the value of the resistance and the current flowing through it.

03:25.750 --> 03:32.160
So let's compare the fifth wheel versus the 10 ohm So the power dissipated in the 50 ohm resistor you

03:32.260 --> 03:37.120
would read like this it's 50 multiplied by the current How much current is flowing through it.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.030
I label that.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.210
And that's squared.

03:40.210 --> 03:43.470
Now when I compare this to the 10 ohm resistance.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.690
So what do we get we get 10.

03:45.700 --> 03:49.770
Now it's the current going through it is I.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.840
So let's compare both of these things.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.060
Well the resistance is bigger here.

03:54.070 --> 03:56.130
It's bigger than 10 so that number is bigger.

03:56.410 --> 04:02.380
And we also know from what we have over here about our current that the current eye is also bigger.

04:02.380 --> 04:05.510
So if I square it it's certainly going to be in the B.

04:06.070 --> 04:14.530
Ok so the largest power consumption then certainly has to be the 50 ohm has the largest value of the

04:14.530 --> 04:17.170
resistance between the 50 and then in the tank.

04:17.260 --> 04:19.620
And we know that the currents are also going to be bigger.

04:19.840 --> 04:26.890
And so 50 is the biggest or the most power dissipated in that 50 ohm resistance so choice number one

04:26.890 --> 04:28.420
is the correct answer for this one.
