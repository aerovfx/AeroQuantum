00:00.260 --> 00:02.460
OK so is concept a problem too.

00:02.520 --> 00:07.850
So the batteries use to light bulbs is shown to light bulbs are in parallel with each other.

00:08.010 --> 00:13.420
What happens now in bulb to bulb one bulb is unscrewed from its socket.

00:13.590 --> 00:15.260
So the bulb is unscrewed.

00:15.260 --> 00:21.510
It basically means that the resistance of this the resistance of a tends toward something very very

00:21.510 --> 00:23.020
big.

00:23.040 --> 00:24.770
So what happens now.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.020
Well again I've got a whole bunch of different choices here.

00:28.020 --> 00:34.230
Bulb goes out bulb gets dimmer without going out gets slightly dimmer stays the same slightly brighter

00:34.230 --> 00:37.190
noticeably brighter possible to determine that.

00:37.380 --> 00:38.040
So what do we think.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.320
Well again the brightness is a soci to how much current is flowing.

00:42.330 --> 00:47.410
Now remember this problem here again we are always dealing with the ideal kind of power supplies here.

00:47.420 --> 00:50.080
Ideal batteries no internal resistance.

00:50.100 --> 00:53.640
So what happens over here is imagine you do a loop rule before.

00:53.640 --> 00:54.470
Right.

00:54.510 --> 00:59.400
If you do a loop rule before after you're going to get the exact same answer right you're going to get

00:59.400 --> 01:06.350
a voltage gain across the battery and you're going to get a drop across this light bulb.

01:06.360 --> 01:11.430
Light bulb and that equals zero regardless of whether A is there or not.

01:12.030 --> 01:12.640
OK.

01:12.810 --> 01:18.330
You always have the same potential difference across light bulb and you always have the same current

01:18.900 --> 01:22.230
which means that the brightness has to stay the same.

01:22.260 --> 01:29.690
So Bulbus be brightness stays the same for is the best answer out of these ones.
