00:00.080 --> 00:01.260
All right concept check nine.

00:01.290 --> 00:04.530
We have two light bulbs that are connected to a wall socket bulb.

00:04.530 --> 00:09.210
Number one they're connected in series as shown here bulb number one is a 100 watt bulb Number two is

00:09.210 --> 00:11.550
40 watt which statement is true.

00:11.930 --> 00:12.270
OK.

00:12.280 --> 00:15.670
Well the wall socket is 120 volts.

00:16.070 --> 00:18.140
These are 100 watt bulb.

00:18.870 --> 00:20.420
Here's a 40 watt bulb.

00:20.970 --> 00:21.240
All right.

00:21.240 --> 00:27.240
Now both light bulbs are at their normal brightness 100 watt bulb is brighter than the 40 watt bulb.

00:27.630 --> 00:36.300
40 watt bulb is brighter than 100 watt equal brightness or can't determine how you might be.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.210
Just try to answer this quickly.

00:38.230 --> 00:45.990
Say oh the wattage of a 100 watt bulb it's it's got a bigger power rating it must be brighter than the

00:45.990 --> 00:47.100
40 watt bulb.

00:47.310 --> 00:51.060
Now you've got to be just a little bit careful when you make that argument because now we have two of

00:51.060 --> 00:54.970
them that are connected in series with each other.

00:55.050 --> 01:02.640
So if you wanted to calculate the power dissipated by a 100 watt bulb Well what you would do is there's

01:02.640 --> 01:07.500
different ways to rate this power equation but one way we saw would be the resistance of the 100 watt

01:07.500 --> 01:08.150
bulb.

01:08.490 --> 01:13.850
Let's call it R1 and multiply by the current flowing through it squared right.

01:13.950 --> 01:18.720
And we know since there are going to be in series the current is going to be the same flowing through

01:18.720 --> 01:20.900
both of them.

01:21.130 --> 01:22.250
So we'll just call that.

01:22.310 --> 01:30.060
I know the power being dissipated by the 40 watt bulb you say it's 40 resistance R2.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.290
OK.

01:31.470 --> 01:34.000
And multiplied by the same current.

01:34.730 --> 01:35.070
All right.

01:35.070 --> 01:40.300
So whichever one dissipates more power should be the brightest light bulb however.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.350
So they both have the same current.

01:43.350 --> 01:46.040
Now we have to determine what is the resistance.

01:46.100 --> 01:46.310
Right.

01:46.320 --> 01:52.950
If we know the resistance are one and our two we'll be able to determine which power is actually bigger.

01:52.950 --> 01:54.290
Now you have to be a little bit careful.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.080
Now we're going to use this information when they kind of rate light bulbs like this.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.190
This is when it's plugged into 120 volts all by itself.

02:03.760 --> 02:09.270
So let's consider a simple circuit where we have just the 100 watt bulb.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.920
Let me just represented by a resistor here.

02:12.510 --> 02:16.840
Here's our resistance one here is 120 volts.

02:17.070 --> 02:22.810
That way you would find the power dissipated here well you can simply write the power being dissipated.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.240
Now the voltage is going to be the same in both cases.

02:25.290 --> 02:29.430
It's going to be 120 an that's divided by the resistance.

02:29.430 --> 02:32.490
This was another way we wrote down the power equation.

02:33.000 --> 02:40.330
So when they write down 100 watts like this that's the power dissipated again V is 120.

02:40.710 --> 02:41.390
So what does that mean.

02:41.390 --> 02:46.980
I means that the resistance is going to be the voltage squared divided by that power rating.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.720
So what does that tell you about the resistance.

02:51.720 --> 02:57.750
It tells you that for 100 watt bulb the resistance again the voltage square divided by the value of

02:57.810 --> 03:06.750
the wattage tells you automatically that the resistance of this guy is actually less than the resistance

03:06.750 --> 03:08.050
of the 40 watt bulb.

03:08.070 --> 03:10.950
Are two.

03:11.050 --> 03:12.270
So that's very important.

03:12.270 --> 03:20.220
Resistance a 40 watt bulb resistance is bigger.

03:20.270 --> 03:25.050
Now we go back to the original statement over here our original equations.

03:25.070 --> 03:29.730
Now it's different in this case because the same current now flows through them.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.690
When you plug them in differently.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.710
Right just like in this little circuit over here if plug in a 100 watt bulb.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.100
And then I substituted for a 40 watt bulb.

03:38.180 --> 03:41.080
You're going to have a different amount of current flowing through it.

03:41.270 --> 03:44.920
But when they're in series with each other the same current flows through them.

03:44.930 --> 03:52.070
So these are my power expressions over here and we just argued that the resistance are two is actually

03:52.070 --> 03:57.650
bigger than the distance are one which means that the power is dissipated by the by that the watt bulb

03:58.130 --> 04:02.920
is going to be bigger in this case than 100 watt bulb when they're in series

04:05.880 --> 04:06.530
OK.

04:06.750 --> 04:11.640
So actually the 40 watt bulb and then the situation is he going to be brighter than 100 watt bulb kind

04:11.640 --> 04:12.720
of counter-intuitive.
