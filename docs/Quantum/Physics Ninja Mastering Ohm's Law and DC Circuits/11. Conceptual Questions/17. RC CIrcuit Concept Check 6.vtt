All writer's concept check number six for RC circuits are you saying the same circuit as before.

00:06.390 --> 00:09.440
So which is close that time equals zero zip.

00:09.450 --> 00:16.630
Now we want to know what is the voltage now across the capacitor see long after the switch is closed

00:16.650 --> 00:25.200
so after a long time what is going to be the potential difference here across across those plates.

00:25.210 --> 00:31.700
OK so in order to solve this well you have to be a little bit careful you can't just say six volts here.

00:31.840 --> 00:38.830
If you say six volts in that case that's really not what's going to happen because this additional resistor

00:38.830 --> 00:42.980
up here is the reason why you're not going to get six volts.

00:43.270 --> 00:47.670
If you think about what happens now well again you're going to charge it up and eventually the charger

00:47.670 --> 00:49.190
is not going to change.

00:49.420 --> 00:54.840
Which means that you're not going to have any more current flow in this outer branch.

00:55.630 --> 01:00.940
If the current is going to be zero and this outer branch again you imagine use an injunction rule it

01:00.940 --> 01:07.630
says then whatever current flows into this junction is basically going to be the same current flowing

01:07.630 --> 01:10.980
down here because eventually this here becomes saturated.

01:11.080 --> 01:17.710
So let's calculate what this current ice is here through this left circuit member in the long time limit

01:17.710 --> 01:23.530
what you do is you basically replace this with a resistance that is very very big.

01:24.310 --> 01:27.150
So no more current is going to flow out here.

01:27.250 --> 01:31.680
So that means we simply have two resistors here that are in series with each other.

01:32.350 --> 01:40.360
So the equivalent resistance is basically just three ohm and a current I was going to be six divided

01:40.360 --> 01:44.080
by three going to be two amps.

01:44.110 --> 01:47.770
So even in a long time limit you have to be amps flowing here.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.620
So what does that mean.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.590
Now we use the fact that we have three branches right.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.850
We have the branch abey.

01:58.200 --> 02:04.420
We have the branch C.B and we have the branch with the capacitor in it.

02:04.680 --> 02:13.260
We know that for any circuit with parallel branches that the voltage across has to be the same.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.780
So actually you can either you can use any branch you want here.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.310
Right.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.930
Let's use this middle branch since we know how much current flows through it.

02:21.040 --> 02:21.250
Right.

02:21.250 --> 02:28.930
If you use the middle one it's right it out the potential difference between Point B and point C is

02:28.930 --> 02:33.190
basically equal to the voltage drop across the two ohm resistor.

02:33.430 --> 02:39.910
The voltage drop across the two Omers This is the value of the resistance multiplied by the current.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.180
In this case two times two which gives me four volts.

02:45.340 --> 02:51.530
I would have also gotten four volts if I look at the potential going from point A to Point B.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.920
Right then must also equal four because you get plus four here you get minus four when you get a drop

02:56.920 --> 03:04.540
across this resistor and you go back there you get zero right so let's ride that one out.

03:04.590 --> 03:07.710
If you start at point eight you're at some potential vitÃ¦.

03:07.710 --> 03:10.550
The next thing you encounter is that six mile battery.

03:10.710 --> 03:13.500
The next thing I encounter is a 1 ohm resistor.

03:13.650 --> 03:19.330
So there is a voltage drop across that resistor given by one multiplied by the current flowing through

03:19.330 --> 03:23.620
it which is two and that there must be equal to the potential at point B.

03:25.270 --> 03:26.060
At the end you get.

03:26.060 --> 03:33.430
VB mine is V.A also equals the four volts same as the previous one that we just did.

03:33.430 --> 03:42.640
So every single branch in this circuit including the capacitor now must be equal to four volts in a

03:42.640 --> 03:44.140
long time limit.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.280
So always five is the best choice for that.
