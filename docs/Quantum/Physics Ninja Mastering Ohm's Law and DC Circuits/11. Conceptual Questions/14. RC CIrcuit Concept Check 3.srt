00:00.340 --> 00:04.290
All right here is concept check number three 3 consider this following circuit here a power supply.

00:04.290 --> 00:11.030
We have three resistors and capacitors initially on charge when the switch is close that time goes to

00:11.040 --> 00:14.140
zero right close that guy up.

00:14.730 --> 00:17.350
Which circuit is equivalent to this circuit.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.610
The instant immediately after the switch is close.

00:21.690 --> 00:28.020
So remember all we do again in a short time limit what you can do is you replace the capacitor basically

00:28.020 --> 00:30.610
just with a wire right.

00:31.260 --> 00:35.170
And that's a basically short a capacitor and that's how it behaves.

00:36.100 --> 00:41.100
In the short time limit now you don't eliminate any of the resistors anywhere.

00:41.140 --> 00:41.350
Right.

00:41.350 --> 00:42.670
That's not what happens.

00:42.850 --> 00:43.370
OK.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.490
So all the resistors still have to be there.

00:45.490 --> 00:48.810
The only thing you do is you simplify any branch with a capacitor.

00:49.030 --> 00:51.550
So right away you should be able to answer that choice.

00:51.550 --> 00:55.970
Number three is the same office you don't get rid of any of the power supply.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
They don't need to go anywhere.

00:58.150 --> 01:00.520
So choice 3 is really the best answer for this case.
