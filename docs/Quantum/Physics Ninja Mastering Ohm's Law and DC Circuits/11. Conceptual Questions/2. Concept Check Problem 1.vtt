All right here's our first concept check problem says a battery is used to light bulbs is shown right.

00:06.690 --> 00:12.690
We light this right bulb a second bulb is then connected by closing a switch and the question is what

00:12.690 --> 00:14.450
happens to the bulbs over here.

00:14.460 --> 00:18.600
So this one was originally lit and what happens when I close the switch and we have a whole bunch of

00:18.600 --> 00:22.110
choices about the brightness of the bulbs.

00:22.200 --> 00:22.440
OK.

00:22.440 --> 00:29.670
So for all these problems here is that the brightness is related to the amount of current flowing through

00:29.670 --> 00:29.870
it.

00:29.970 --> 00:31.170
OK.

00:31.170 --> 00:34.410
So just think about it like that the more current that flows through a light bulb the brighter it's

00:34.410 --> 00:35.220
going to get.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.590
So the way you kind of tackle this problem is say well we have a potential difference here we have a

00:40.590 --> 00:44.530
voltage and current is initially flowing like this.

00:44.640 --> 00:49.380
Actually you can use Ohm's law here use a loop rule but you know that the voltage across any branch

00:49.380 --> 00:50.960
here has to be the same.

00:50.970 --> 00:53.800
So let's imagine that the voltage of the battery is V.

00:54.140 --> 00:54.620
OK.

00:54.810 --> 00:58.080
And imagine this light bulb here has a resistance R.

00:58.470 --> 01:03.480
So the amount of current that you're going to get flowing through this bulb when the switch is open

01:03.960 --> 01:07.550
is going to be divided by far.

01:07.680 --> 01:07.970
All right.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.070
Well the next part is what happens now.

01:10.170 --> 01:13.790
What happens when you close the switch when you close the switch.

01:13.830 --> 01:17.030
Well now you can have current in this other branch right.

01:17.040 --> 01:20.710
Because you have a finite resistance and it's the same bulb.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.430
So the resistance here is the same.

01:23.430 --> 01:25.090
The next thing you should know is that.

01:25.140 --> 01:29.110
So we have our current that's also going to flow in this branch.

01:29.270 --> 01:35.040
Actually if you apply Ohm's law again if you apply Ohm's law once the switch is close if you apply Ohm's

01:35.040 --> 01:41.460
law going around this left hand loop and you go around in the counter clockwise direction again what

01:41.460 --> 01:46.050
you're going to find is v equals to whatever current is in this branch.

01:46.440 --> 01:54.580
Let's call it to and the resistances are so you're going to have are multiplied by two.

01:54.590 --> 02:00.230
So what do we get if we get that the current I is simply the voltage divided by the resistance which

02:00.230 --> 02:02.070
is the same right.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.090
You notice it's the same.

02:04.150 --> 02:09.200
So in this case if the current is the same it automatically means that the brightness has to stay the

02:09.200 --> 02:10.990
same.

02:11.030 --> 02:16.460
So the one that kind of tells us that says the light bulbs brightness stays the same there is no reason

02:16.460 --> 02:21.340
for this bulb here to switch the voltage across it is always the same.

02:21.780 --> 02:22.600
OK.

02:22.790 --> 02:27.980
And both bulbs are going to have the same brightness because they have the same current flowing through

02:27.980 --> 02:28.400
it.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.420
So really this one here is the hopes.

02:31.490 --> 02:34.340
So I picked the right pick the wrong one here really.

02:34.340 --> 02:36.320
Number four here's the best choice.

02:36.320 --> 02:36.560
All right.

02:36.560 --> 02:42.530
The bulb stays the same because the currents the same and they both have the same brightness.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.160
All right so that's it for the first problem.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.370
Hopefully you understand that one.
