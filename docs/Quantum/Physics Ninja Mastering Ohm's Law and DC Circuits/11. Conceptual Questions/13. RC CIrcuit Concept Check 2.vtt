00:00.300 --> 00:00.600
All right.

00:00.600 --> 00:04.260
So here is a concept check too for RC circuits.

00:04.260 --> 00:06.990
Again it's the same circuit over here.

00:06.990 --> 00:08.550
We closed the switch.

00:08.550 --> 00:13.560
Except now we want to know what is the voltage across the capacitor after a long time.

00:13.710 --> 00:14.820
OK.

00:14.820 --> 00:16.640
And again you go to all these voltages here.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.910
None of the above impossible to determine.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.960
OK so let's close up that switch and let's think about this for a minute.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.320
Right.

00:23.400 --> 00:33.810
So initially what we have initially the charge was zero and the voltage was also zero.

00:34.580 --> 00:41.480
And basically at time equals to zero you can basically replace the capacitor by just a wire right.

00:41.480 --> 00:44.760
You imagine that the capacitor is shorted.

00:44.810 --> 00:49.570
So there's initially a lot of current and you start building up charge right.

00:49.820 --> 00:56.750
So as time goes on Q goes up which means that the voltage goes up so to initially zero but then it goes

00:56.750 --> 00:58.280
up as a function of time.

00:58.940 --> 01:01.780
And then q reaches a maximum value.

01:01.930 --> 01:02.120
Right.

01:02.120 --> 01:09.740
Once it's fully charge it reaches a maximum value which means that the voltage also reaches a maximum

01:09.740 --> 01:11.680
value.

01:11.690 --> 01:18.300
Now once the charge reaches its maximum value it means there is no more change in the charge.

01:18.350 --> 01:25.730
So that means that the current has to be equal to zero because the current is how the charge changes

01:25.730 --> 01:28.000
with respect to time.

01:28.010 --> 01:34.910
So really in this limit in a long time limit there is no more current and if there is no more current

01:35.270 --> 01:40.630
it means that if you look at this guy if the current is zero it means that the voltage drop across.

01:40.630 --> 01:43.800
This guy also must be equal to zero.

01:44.420 --> 01:51.860
So if you apply Kirchhoff's loop rle now and you do plus six across the battery and theres no more voltage

01:51.860 --> 01:56.510
drop across here because there is no more current right that guy equals to zero.

01:56.750 --> 02:02.550
So that means you have to have a voltage drop across the capacitor and thats it.

02:02.570 --> 02:07.100
The voltage across the capacitor at the end has to be equal to six volts.

02:07.100 --> 02:11.000
It has to be equal to the voltage across the power supply.

02:11.600 --> 02:15.110
So the correct answer for this one is Choice number seven and thats six volts.
