00:00.320 --> 00:01.670
It so here problem 7.

00:01.770 --> 00:06.330
I battery with five identical bulbs are shown.

00:06.330 --> 00:11.040
What happens when they switches close close up that switch.

00:11.050 --> 00:12.180
Here are some choices.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.450
All five bulbs turn on with equal brightness.

00:15.570 --> 00:19.520
All five bulbs turn on but they don't have equal brightness.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.280
One of the bulbs does not turn on the other four have equal brightness.

00:23.320 --> 00:28.380
Any other choice is to more the bulbs do not turn on one of the bulbs does not turn on the other for

00:28.380 --> 00:32.830
turn on but they dont have equal brightness or you have no idea.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.310
Hopefully you didn't choose that one.

00:34.680 --> 00:35.030
All right.

00:35.040 --> 00:38.020
So the key here is that they are identical.

00:38.130 --> 00:46.650
So if you want to label all of them are you can do that same resistance and we have one voltage here

00:46.740 --> 00:49.450
one battery connected to this.

00:49.470 --> 00:54.430
So first thing you would kind of consider is well there is going to be a current at least in this bridge.

00:54.450 --> 00:57.460
All right are going to have some current Let's call it current.

00:58.130 --> 01:03.630
So what we want to do now is try to argue what is going to be the current in each.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.010
For this I'm going to try to use symmetry I'm going to try really not to write down a lot of equations.

01:09.720 --> 01:15.600
So symmetry means you just compare the different sides and if they kind of look the same it's probably

01:15.600 --> 01:18.480
because things kind have to be the same.

01:18.660 --> 01:20.150
So let's go over here.

01:20.190 --> 01:26.280
Imagine here we have a junction so whatever current is flowing through this branch let's call it a and

01:26.300 --> 01:29.860
the current down in this branch and makes sense to call it IB.

01:30.060 --> 01:35.190
Right we know that from the junction rule that the total current flowing into the junction has to be

01:35.190 --> 01:36.680
the total flowing out.

01:36.990 --> 01:39.320
So you have to have this.

01:39.390 --> 01:44.590
I said I was going to write down any equations that look to me I'm writing down equations boy.

01:45.090 --> 01:45.300
All right.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.620
How about down over here at this end.

01:48.330 --> 01:51.870
Well again let's assume here again the current is going to flow down this resistance.

01:51.870 --> 01:56.180
This will be the current ID and is going to be a current over here.

01:56.190 --> 01:58.350
I e right.

01:58.980 --> 02:04.920
So on the other end I know that the total current I hear is still the same that has to be the same current

02:04.950 --> 02:06.860
everywhere in this branch.

02:06.920 --> 02:14.960
So you also have to have this ID plus IB they're both flowing into the junction.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.240
They have to be what's flowing out of the junction so the other argument you have to say now is well

02:22.350 --> 02:23.850
look at both of these resistors right.

02:23.850 --> 02:25.540
They're both the same.

02:25.860 --> 02:33.300
So why would the current you know if saw we previously talked quite a bit about simplifying networks

02:33.300 --> 02:34.730
of resistors.

02:34.770 --> 02:41.640
Actually if you try to simplify this case here you really can't simplify it in terms of series resistance

02:41.700 --> 02:47.320
only series and sorry parallel networks.

02:47.430 --> 02:53.120
This case doesn't work because of resistance see it complicates things over here.

02:53.430 --> 02:55.620
So you really can't do that for this problem.

02:55.620 --> 02:57.280
It really doesn't work.

02:57.330 --> 03:00.240
No that's why I say we're going to have to use symmetry here.

03:00.300 --> 03:05.460
So these guys don't work but more current.

03:05.460 --> 03:12.510
I say in IAB again since the resistors are kind of the same you should be able to argue that I must

03:12.510 --> 03:17.120
be equal to the current IB because they're all the same over here.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.230
So whatever current flows in has to be the current flowing out.

03:21.800 --> 03:27.390
And likewise I think you should be able to argue that the current ID also must be equal to the current

03:27.450 --> 03:33.900
i.e. the only time you're going to get different currents in different branches is if the resistances

03:33.900 --> 03:40.020
are going to be different if the resistances are the same you always get the same current flowing through

03:40.020 --> 03:42.630
those different branches.

03:42.670 --> 03:46.500
So now once you've kind of argued this case over here.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.200
Well now you consider the voltage across right.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.360
If you do start over here the voltage.

03:51.410 --> 03:53.590
So you at some particular voltage up here.

03:53.670 --> 04:05.980
Call it B and the voltage drop across the resistance are a voltage drop across that resistance.

04:05.980 --> 04:12.370
It's simply that all of the resistance multiplied by the current And that's going to be the same voltage

04:12.370 --> 04:13.560
drop.

04:13.630 --> 04:20.520
If I go crawl across a distance R B so that there must also be equal to this guy.

04:20.830 --> 04:23.560
That's the voltage drop across resistance.

04:24.070 --> 04:32.920
So that means at this point coin 1 and point 2 are at the exact same potential.

04:33.850 --> 04:38.220
And if they are at the exact same potential at the end you should be able to convince yourself that

04:38.230 --> 04:45.040
that is there is no voltage difference between Point 1 and point 2 voltage at point 1 is equal to the

04:45.040 --> 04:47.140
voltage at point 2.

04:47.200 --> 04:53.200
So if there's no voltage difference it means that the current flowing through the resistance C must

04:53.200 --> 04:56.020
be equal to zero.

04:56.410 --> 04:57.820
Because there is no voltage difference.

04:57.820 --> 05:02.380
The only time you get a current current through any point is if there is voltage difference between

05:02.380 --> 05:04.240
the two.

05:04.240 --> 05:08.990
All right so at the end of this the say that the current through this middle is this there if they're

05:08.980 --> 05:12.970
all the same now if one of them is different that's that's going to change the situation.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.350
But if they're all the same.

05:15.370 --> 05:17.980
This is a specific case of a bridge network.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.300
They call this a bridge network.

05:21.040 --> 05:25.030
And we're going to find that there is no current flowing through through the resistance down the middle

05:25.360 --> 05:28.740
and are going to be the same current flowing going every else.

05:28.870 --> 05:35.860
So that means that the brightness of the 4 A B D and E are going to be the same.

05:36.490 --> 05:41.580
So the correct answer has to be choice number three.

05:41.590 --> 05:44.210
I mean one of the bulbs does not turn on.

05:44.350 --> 05:45.500
That will be the see.

05:45.580 --> 05:49.880
And the other four have equal brightness because they have the same current flowing through it.
