All right here is concept check five cent batteries used to light a bulb is shown an identical battery.

00:05.640 --> 00:11.070
This one here on the left is connected now by closing the switch to close that up over here.

00:11.670 --> 00:16.650
And the question is what happens to the bulb when I close the switch so it goes out and goes dimmer

00:16.650 --> 00:23.670
slightly dimmer stays the same and gets slightly brighter gets noticed lewdly brighter or combination

00:23.670 --> 00:26.230
of kind of two of these answers.

00:26.250 --> 00:31.260
So in order to kind of look at this one I would suggest Well let's see what happens initially before

00:31.260 --> 00:32.680
I close the switch.

00:33.080 --> 00:33.330
OK.

00:33.330 --> 00:38.700
Before you close the switch if you apply a loop rule Kurkov loop rule over here what you're going to

00:38.700 --> 00:39.710
find here again.

00:39.730 --> 00:42.790
Both of these batteries here soon to be the same.

00:42.870 --> 00:43.860
Now let's do that.

00:43.950 --> 00:50.400
And now if I do a loop rule around this one this here has a resistance are let's label the current through

00:50.400 --> 00:52.080
here just as big.

00:52.080 --> 00:54.320
I know what you're going to find here.

00:54.330 --> 01:01.110
If I do a loop around this direction over here so you'd add the voltage of the battery you get V and

01:01.110 --> 01:08.130
then you would get a voltage drop across that resistor given by minus our ohms law.

01:08.340 --> 01:10.370
And then you go back to where you started.

01:10.830 --> 01:16.020
So you'd find that the current here is equal to V divided by the resistance.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.160
Now how about now once you close the switch what happens once you close the switch.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.510
Now this battery here becomes activated.

01:23.520 --> 01:24.960
Right.

01:24.970 --> 01:30.910
Imagine I did a loop rule now and I went across this outer loop where would I get well again and started

01:30.920 --> 01:31.670
here at the red point.

01:31.680 --> 01:33.980
Let's go around in the clockwise fashion.

01:34.230 --> 01:39.420
So again you get V and then you get minus i r equals zero.

01:39.660 --> 01:40.320
And look what you get.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.230
You get the exact same current.

01:43.240 --> 01:43.810
All right.

01:43.860 --> 01:50.340
So you get the exact same current here whether or not you put one battery or two batteries.

01:50.480 --> 01:51.030
OK.

01:51.270 --> 01:57.230
So the brightness of the bulb has to stay the same if the current stays the same there is no difference.

01:57.240 --> 02:00.210
Now you might ask what really is the difference now in this problem.

02:00.210 --> 02:06.450
I mean so the current in this branch over here stays the same current over here stays the same current

02:06.450 --> 02:08.480
flowing through the resistor stays the same.

02:08.490 --> 02:15.510
However if you are now going to just look at the current in each individual branch what you would find

02:15.510 --> 02:21.980
now is that the battery doesn't have to work as hard if the current is the same through this resistor

02:22.000 --> 02:27.420
it means that the power dissipated in this resistor is the same whether or not you include one battery

02:27.420 --> 02:29.220
or two battery.

02:29.250 --> 02:34.030
So the only difference now is that the batteries don't have to work as hard.

02:34.080 --> 02:40.410
The power dissipated in the resistor has to equal to the total power supplied by each battery.

02:40.410 --> 02:45.060
Now the way you really show this now so you imagine here we have that current I kind of flowing in this

02:45.120 --> 02:51.270
outer branch in order to really show that the current Now what's going to happen is that the current

02:51.270 --> 02:54.130
in each battery is going to be cut in half.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.670
And the way you show that is unfortunately you do have to include a little bit of resistance so I just

02:59.670 --> 03:01.970
want to just show you how to do this.

03:02.100 --> 03:08.390
I imagine there was a little bit of internal resistance to each battery and I imagine now we're going

03:08.390 --> 03:14.430
to call the current through this one let's call this one going to call the current in this middle branch

03:14.430 --> 03:20.340
call it to and what we have here is we have a junction will either at the top or the bottom and the

03:20.340 --> 03:22.750
junction rule tells us that I won.

03:22.980 --> 03:26.490
Plus I too must be equal to I.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.650
So now we need a way to link.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.710
I want an I too.

03:29.710 --> 03:34.510
We just know the total current here the total current is given by this expression here.

03:35.010 --> 03:39.810
But how do we find the individual current through each branch in order to do this you really have to

03:39.810 --> 03:43.410
introduce a little bit of resistance and you'll see it's going to cancel out.

03:43.410 --> 03:48.510
But in order to do the math by applying Kirchoff's laws you have to do that.

03:48.780 --> 03:53.550
So now we're going to do we're into a loose rule and we're going to go on this elder and then come back

03:53.550 --> 03:54.830
through the middle.

03:55.290 --> 04:02.780
So if I do that in again I'll choose the let's shoot clockwise direction again.

04:03.110 --> 04:06.510
And what we're going to do or just we're just going round this way through the battery we're going to

04:06.510 --> 04:09.120
assume there's a little bit of resistance and then come back down.

04:10.470 --> 04:10.820
All right.

04:10.830 --> 04:15.700
So plie Kirchoff's law the first thing I encounter is that voltage of the battery V.

04:15.960 --> 04:21.150
Now if there is there's a little resistance there's going to be a drop in the drop voltage drops that

04:21.150 --> 04:23.450
little resistance is going to be this.

04:23.640 --> 04:29.240
And now I go back I go through the battery now but I'm going in the opposite direction of the current.

04:29.390 --> 04:34.340
It looks like this again I just assume the internal resistance of the battery is the same.

04:34.360 --> 04:35.200
And now look what happens.

04:35.190 --> 04:41.260
Now I cross this ideal well enough so you get mine and then you go back to where you started.

04:41.340 --> 04:44.880
Right let's look at this expression Vee's cancel out.

04:44.880 --> 04:48.470
Now you see why I had to introduce a little bit of resistance if I didn't have that.

04:48.490 --> 04:50.770
There you would just have zero equals zero.

04:51.030 --> 04:57.450
But by introducing both of these terms you could see now about simplify this expression we have we have

04:57.450 --> 05:00.580
a little R on both terms actually you can cancel it out now.

05:00.590 --> 05:06.030
So it really doesn't matter what the internal resistance is which you do this and you can show now that

05:06.050 --> 05:09.520
I one has to be equal to Aitu.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.840
So that's kind of one equation.

05:11.940 --> 05:18.950
And now if you go to the top this is our junction rule if I one equals the Aitu that means that to I

05:18.950 --> 05:22.720
on have to be equal to the total burn I.

05:22.890 --> 05:30.500
So now you can see that the current through each battery B is actually cut in half kind of different

05:30.500 --> 05:32.240
ways of looking at this problem.

05:32.390 --> 05:34.760
But in both cases the brightness has to stay the same.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.150
And we got that just from the first part.
