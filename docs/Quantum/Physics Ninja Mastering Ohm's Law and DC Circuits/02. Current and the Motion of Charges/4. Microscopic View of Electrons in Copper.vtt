00:00.880 --> 00:03.840
We're going to do is we're going to consider a piece of copper.

00:03.870 --> 00:06.290
Copper is a very good conductor.

00:06.330 --> 00:08.410
It has 29 each.

00:08.430 --> 00:15.840
Each copper atom has 29 protons and each copper atom has 29 electrons so it's electrically neutral.

00:15.840 --> 00:23.180
Now when you take a piece of copper wire here I've drawn kind of these copper atoms everywhere.

00:23.190 --> 00:29.040
Now what happens here if you look at the electronic structure of copper the shell is kind of full and

00:29.040 --> 00:35.520
you have this one electron here out here that's kind of further away from the nucleus and it's really

00:35.520 --> 00:40.970
this electron here that takes part in the conduction the further away from the positive nucleus.

00:41.040 --> 00:48.090
Therefore it feels the least amount of attractive force to the nucleus and is basically free to move

00:48.090 --> 00:48.920
in the copper.

00:49.180 --> 00:49.910
OK.

00:50.040 --> 00:54.930
Now this picture here at the top basically shows you what would happen if I connect a piece of copper

00:54.930 --> 00:56.830
wire to a battery.

00:56.910 --> 01:01.830
So this here is the electric field imagine the battery produces an electric field that's pointing from

01:01.830 --> 01:03.740
the right side to the left side.

01:04.170 --> 01:09.510
So that means we saw in the previous picture there should be a force acting on these electrons and there

01:09.510 --> 01:16.110
should be an electron or an acceleration rather acting or an acceleration of these electrons given by

01:16.110 --> 01:23.250
this expression which would mean that the velocity if it starts from wrasse should be given by a Times

01:23.560 --> 01:28.750
some amount of time that should be what the velocity is in the bigger time as well.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.900
The bigger the velocity is.

01:31.140 --> 01:36.810
However that's not really what happens because these electrons out here these electrons well they're

01:36.810 --> 01:38.850
not in free space anymore.

01:38.940 --> 01:46.200
What happens to them is they end up colliding with these positive ions and they can also collide with

01:46.230 --> 01:47.790
other electrons going on.

01:47.790 --> 01:51.930
There's a lot of things that can happen with these electrons so although there is an electric field

01:51.930 --> 01:57.750
pointing from the right side to the left side the motion of an electron even when there is an electric

01:57.750 --> 02:03.840
field present is not really like this it accelerates for a little bit but then it bounces off and goes

02:03.840 --> 02:09.030
in a different direction it accelerates a little bit then it bounces off and goes in a different direction.

02:09.030 --> 02:15.360
So overall I mean the motion can kind of be kind of very complicated but there is kind of a net flow

02:15.570 --> 02:22.020
going from in this case from the left side you know toward this side but the motion is not just the

02:22.020 --> 02:23.870
nice smooth flow going.

02:23.910 --> 02:29.790
If I look at each individual electron the motion can be actually quite complicated and if you would

02:29.790 --> 02:34.090
turn off that electric field if I unplug the battery Well what would it look like.

02:34.090 --> 02:41.480
If you look at your wire again these wires are at room temperature and you look at each individual electron

02:41.490 --> 02:47.490
in that case what would happen is again it would still move just due to thermal fluctuation.

02:47.500 --> 02:54.120
However if you examine just one particular cross-section the number of electrons that would cross in

02:54.120 --> 02:58.820
one direction would be the same number of electrons that would cross in the other direction.

02:58.830 --> 03:06.330
So if the electric field is zero Chargers are still moving due to thermal fluctuations.

03:06.570 --> 03:13.080
But there is no net drift of these electrons so the drift velocity should go to zero on that limit which

03:13.080 --> 03:16.240
means that the current should go to zero if there is no electric field.

03:17.770 --> 03:23.620
So if you look at kind of the velocity of these electrons just due to thermal fluctuations you know

03:23.740 --> 03:28.950
in copper you're looking at numbers that are approximately 10 to the six meters per second.

03:29.020 --> 03:31.700
That's a really really fast.

03:31.840 --> 03:39.670
Now due to all of these collisions what happens that drift velocity just this net kind of constant velocity

03:39.670 --> 03:46.060
of these electrons kind of flowing down this drift velocity is to the order of.

03:46.150 --> 03:48.870
Let me just write it like this one millimeter per second.

03:50.230 --> 03:50.790
All right.

03:50.870 --> 03:55.460
This is one times tend to the negative 3 meters per second.

03:55.910 --> 04:01.580
It's orders of magnitude slower than the velocity of these electrons only because of all these collisions

04:01.940 --> 04:04.800
and everything else going on.

04:05.010 --> 04:10.980
And that's even in the best conductors can make this number a little bit bigger by increasing the magnitude

04:10.980 --> 04:12.230
of the electric field.

04:12.510 --> 04:14.090
We'll see this connection in just a minute.

04:14.100 --> 04:18.960
But this is just to give you kind of an idea of the orders of magnitude at play.
