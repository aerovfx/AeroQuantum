All right let's go back to basics for a minute here and just to kind of remember a few things.

00:05.580 --> 00:06.670
Charge.

00:06.900 --> 00:09.220
We're going to look at the motion of charges in a minute.

00:09.420 --> 00:19.140
But the concept of charge first thing is it's quantized for our purposes that means that the elementary

00:19.140 --> 00:26.780
charge you often call that even the elementary charge is called and the magnitude of is 1.6 times 10

00:26.850 --> 00:31.580
to the negative 19 and charge is measured in cool homes.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.340
Now we typically look at two types of things we look at electrons

00:38.020 --> 00:42.120
and we're going to look at electron motion a lot because we're looking at the motion of electrons in

00:42.390 --> 00:43.260
circuits.

00:43.260 --> 00:48.130
THAT'S WHAT DOES THE that's what moves in electric circuits.

00:48.270 --> 00:53.500
And the charge of electrons is simply minus the elementary charge.

00:53.610 --> 00:59.040
We can look at protons for example protons have the same magnitude.

00:59.130 --> 01:05.520
However they're positive the elementary charge since the charge is quantized it means even if you have

01:05.520 --> 01:13.230
a some object here with a whole bunch of charge on it could have an answer draw a whole bunch of different

01:13.230 --> 01:14.800
electrons on it.

01:14.910 --> 01:19.460
The total charge of this object we can call it q big.

01:19.470 --> 01:24.820
Q That must be equal to a certain number depending on how many of these lines I've drawn here how many

01:24.820 --> 01:29.090
electrons are on here multiplied by the elementary charge.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.410
And again I can use positive or negative.

01:31.750 --> 01:35.330
But this would here be the total charge of that object.

01:35.380 --> 01:40.060
It's always some number I don't know 10 20.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.890
Ten of the six

01:47.180 --> 01:51.290
this huge number multiplied times the elementary charge.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.680
So these are just some basic definitions here.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.750
Just to remember.

01:55.910 --> 01:59.140
Now let's just consider one electron here out in space.

01:59.150 --> 02:02.150
So here's an electron that really I want to make it move.

02:02.150 --> 02:03.800
So how would I make this electron move.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.540
Well I'd make it move by producing an electric field.

02:07.880 --> 02:15.580
So let's imagine now produce an electric field for example pointing from the right to the left side.

02:15.800 --> 02:20.870
If I place this electron in that electric field you should remember from electrostatics that you're

02:20.870 --> 02:27.640
going to have a force acting on this electron the force acting on this electron is going to be F and

02:27.650 --> 02:34.640
it's simply given by the magnitude of the charge which is e multiplied by the magnitude of the electric

02:34.640 --> 02:36.460
field which is uppercase.

02:36.830 --> 02:38.950
That's the total force acting on this charge.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.650
I already know the direction the direction is always opposite of the electric field.

02:42.650 --> 02:44.920
If the charge is negative.

02:45.020 --> 02:47.750
Newton's second law says you add up all those forces.

02:47.850 --> 02:50.820
And that has to be equal to mass times acceleration.

02:51.350 --> 02:58.820
So the acceleration now of an electron placed inside a an electric field can be given by lowercase E

02:58.820 --> 03:05.720
which is the charge that electron my 1.6 times 10 of the negative 19 the magnitude of the electric field

03:06.110 --> 03:12.230
and divided by the mass that's the acceleration of a free electron when you place it in an electric

03:12.230 --> 03:12.990
field.

03:13.900 --> 03:19.270
And that's important because in circuits we're going to want to make charges move from one direction

03:19.270 --> 03:20.100
to another.

03:20.410 --> 03:27.390
And the way we produce electric fields is by using a battery.

03:27.590 --> 03:32.900
Now in this case here this electron would simply accelerate which means that its velocity would constantly

03:32.990 --> 03:34.030
increase.

03:34.130 --> 03:34.370
Right.

03:34.360 --> 03:39.890
Imagine if it started from rest after 10 seconds its speed would be pretty big after 20 seconds its

03:39.890 --> 03:41.930
speed would be even bigger.

03:41.930 --> 03:47.660
We're going to see that real conductors the it's not really what happens because the electrons are not

03:47.660 --> 03:49.440
free in space.

03:49.550 --> 03:52.970
So let's go ahead and look at that picture from a microscopic viewpoint.
