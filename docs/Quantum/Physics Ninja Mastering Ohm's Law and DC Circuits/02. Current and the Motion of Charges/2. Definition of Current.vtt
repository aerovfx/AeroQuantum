00:00.580 --> 00:05.440
All right let's look at the definition of a current here for there to be current.

00:05.460 --> 00:13.110
We have to have charges that are moving or moving charges.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.980
Now let's consider this section over here.

00:15.980 --> 00:21.150
I'm going to define N a little and this is often done in a lot of books here.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.130
This is defined as the number of charges

00:27.640 --> 00:29.530
per unit volume.

00:29.560 --> 00:34.350
They call this the charge density.

00:34.520 --> 00:41.370
It's kind of like a density but it's not mass density It's charge density.

00:41.700 --> 00:46.250
So imagine each one of these are kind of either electrons or doesn't matter.

00:46.260 --> 00:48.250
It could be positive charges.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.950
Let's just set them up as electrons for example.

00:51.210 --> 00:51.770
OK.

00:51.780 --> 00:55.480
And this material here has a particular charge density.

00:55.530 --> 01:01.650
So what if I wanted to look at a certain section a certain section of material that has a cross section

01:01.680 --> 01:02.330
A.

01:02.570 --> 01:08.170
And let's consider a length here let's call it delta x.

01:08.270 --> 01:13.070
So this material here has a certain little end which is a certain charge density.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.220
How would I calculate the total charge here in this in this volume.

01:18.420 --> 01:20.520
Well imagine if you wanted to know the total charge.

01:20.550 --> 01:26.080
If I do it from just dimensional analysis I could do the number of charges

01:29.840 --> 01:33.340
per unit volume.

01:33.350 --> 01:39.270
Now I want to get rid of volume so I also need to multiply by the volume or volume.

01:39.270 --> 01:42.100
Am I looking at the volume of the material involved.

01:42.510 --> 01:46.040
Now again I need to get charge at the end which has to be in cool ohms.

01:46.350 --> 01:52.140
So I also need to multiply need to get rid of number of charges and I need to introduce what is the

01:52.140 --> 01:56.110
charge of each of those charges.

01:56.430 --> 02:02.820
So what is the number of our what is the Coolum per charge.

02:02.830 --> 02:09.220
So the way this looks like in terms of an equation now is the first term is the charge density at little

02:09.260 --> 02:16.130
n the next term is the volume so its the volume of this particular section while its the cross section

02:16.130 --> 02:21.070
which is a multiplied by the length rates the volume of the cylinder.

02:21.080 --> 02:29.610
So that's delta x That's our middle term and the last term is what is the charge of each one of those

02:29.610 --> 02:30.680
guys right.

02:30.720 --> 02:36.600
The number of cool homes pre-charge that's simply my elementary charge.

02:36.660 --> 02:41.990
And it could be positive or negative again let's just said it is as positive in this case.

02:42.270 --> 02:44.930
I'm just looking for the magnitude here of the total charge.

02:44.970 --> 02:47.940
I don't care whether it's positive or negative.

02:47.940 --> 02:48.650
All right.

02:48.750 --> 02:58.060
Now let's imagine in some unit time it's called the unit time delta x that all of these charges here

02:58.390 --> 03:00.700
flow past this cross section.

03:00.820 --> 03:01.390
Right.

03:01.450 --> 03:07.390
I'm standing over here and I count that all of these charges in this volume will effectively move through

03:07.390 --> 03:09.080
that cross section.

03:09.340 --> 03:16.510
If I have moving charges I'm going to have an electric current and that electric current is I this is

03:16.510 --> 03:24.620
the definition of the current and is basically simply looking at the total amount of charge Delta Q

03:24.860 --> 03:25.700
or the total charge.

03:25.700 --> 03:33.370
Q that goes by per unit time we see right away that the units of the electric current are going to be

03:33.370 --> 03:39.910
measured and cool ohms per unit time which is seconds to put a square bracket around there to remind

03:39.910 --> 03:46.920
me that these are the units and Esai units we call this an amp.

03:47.230 --> 03:54.510
Sometimes you just use the short form just a just to denote a cool on second.

03:54.520 --> 03:55.060
All right.

03:55.390 --> 04:00.930
So we know the total amount of charge in this volume here is Q Which Ive got written over here.

04:01.210 --> 04:05.850
What if I now say that all of these charges move past this area.

04:06.070 --> 04:09.220
What would be the electric current in this case.

04:09.220 --> 04:14.710
Well again if I'm just going to apply the definition of the electric current so the current Now in this

04:14.710 --> 04:20.370
case is simply going to be how much charge goes by this amount of charge that goes by.

04:20.560 --> 04:31.420
So its an a delta x the charge of each of those guys divided by the amount of time.

04:31.460 --> 04:36.170
Now if we look at some of the constant terms that I can factor it out let me kind of put some brackets

04:36.170 --> 04:38.270
here just to clean this up a little bit.

04:38.780 --> 04:42.290
Let's look at some of the constant terms and maybe we could pull some of those out.

04:42.290 --> 04:47.000
So and is a charge density that is a constant I go pull pull it out.

04:47.170 --> 04:50.360
Else the charge of each electron move that outside.

04:50.360 --> 04:56.150
Here is the cross-sectional area if I'm looking at a piece of wire for example.

04:56.240 --> 05:00.500
Typically the cross section is more or less constant in the last term over here.

05:00.500 --> 05:08.870
If you look at a delta x divided by Delta T delta x divided by Delta T if you remember what is the definition

05:08.870 --> 05:09.780
of that.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.710
That is a velocity.

05:11.710 --> 05:12.020
All right.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.860
That has the units of velocity.

05:14.150 --> 05:17.280
Thats the definition of my velocity.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.630
It kind of depends on how fast those charters are moving that makes sense right.

05:21.650 --> 05:26.600
If the velocity is fast youre going to have more charge thats going to flow by that.

05:26.600 --> 05:28.860
This guy's going to count.

05:28.910 --> 05:35.270
So at the end my electric current you can ride it out from a microscopic point of view as this charge

05:35.270 --> 05:44.090
density and the charge of each electron multiplied by the cross-sectional area and Delta X over delta

05:44.090 --> 05:50.560
t they call this the velocity and we usually put a little D underneath the little d underneath refers

05:50.570 --> 05:53.570
to the drift velocity they call this the drift velocity.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.400
I'll explain this in just a second.

05:58.980 --> 06:03.990
But overall this equation should make sense right now and we've kind of done it from a using dimensional

06:03.990 --> 06:06.640
analysis in order to get to this final equation.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.210
But hopefully these terms make sense right.

06:10.780 --> 06:16.390
Clearly if you have more charges per unit volume you're going to have a larger current right.

06:16.450 --> 06:22.180
If each of those individual charges in how I've looked at electrons but if each one would have a bigger

06:22.180 --> 06:26.040
unit then that would also lead to a bigger current If there is a bigger cross-section.

06:26.080 --> 06:31.720
There are more charges that are going past this cross-sectional area and the faster they move the more

06:31.720 --> 06:33.260
current I'm going to get.

06:34.700 --> 06:35.120
All right.

06:35.150 --> 06:38.510
Now let's go ahead and look a little bit more closely at what this draft philosophy is.
