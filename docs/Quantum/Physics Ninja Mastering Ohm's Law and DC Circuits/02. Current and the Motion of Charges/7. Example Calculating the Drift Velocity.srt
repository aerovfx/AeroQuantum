00:00.460 --> 00:04.560
As do a simple example here of finding the draft philosophy.

00:04.620 --> 00:12.090
So why are used in experiments is typically made of copper and this radius here is approximately 0.7

00:12.090 --> 00:19.020
millimeters take the density of copper it's the density the material is eight point nine grams per centimeter

00:19.020 --> 00:25.160
cube and the molar mass of copper is approximately 63 three and a half grams per mole.

00:25.170 --> 00:30.510
All right so estimate the total charge of free electrons in each meter of this wire.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.460
If you have a current of one ampere.

00:33.730 --> 00:33.970
OK.

00:33.990 --> 00:37.650
So let's kind of just draw it out for a second here.

00:37.650 --> 00:41.940
Remember we have our equation here an equation that relates the current the drift velocity and everything

00:41.940 --> 00:43.040
else.

00:43.090 --> 00:44.790
Let's just examine what's going on here.

00:44.790 --> 00:53.500
So first we're going to have a length of copper that is 1 meter.

00:53.750 --> 00:57.830
So the first thing we have to do we know the density we have to figure out how many electrons are located

00:57.830 --> 00:58.590
in this one.

00:58.670 --> 01:00.060
What is the total charge.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.760
Q inside.

01:02.030 --> 01:04.680
Well let's think about our equation for a second.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.800
So if we have one meter I know that density of copper is this.

01:08.900 --> 01:13.520
Let me try to figure out how many actual copper atoms are located in this one meter.

01:13.610 --> 01:14.200
Right.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.650
What is the number of atoms.

01:15.770 --> 01:19.940
And I know each one here gives me approximately 1 free electron.

01:19.940 --> 01:26.450
So if I can figure out what is the number of copper atoms in per meter I know the volume because I know

01:26.450 --> 01:29.560
the cross-sectional area here I know the radius.

01:29.720 --> 01:33.170
So I could probably calculate what the cross-sectional area is.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.670
I know the length is 1 meter.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.530
So lets start thinking about this.

01:37.550 --> 01:45.220
So first you consider the volume What is the total volume while its going to be the length multiplied

01:45.220 --> 01:48.240
by the area in that area.

01:48.250 --> 01:50.190
So let's just do the length is one.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.840
Actually I don't even need to write that.

01:52.330 --> 02:01.630
And it's a one multiplied by the cross section which is going to be pi the circle an R squared in radius

02:01.630 --> 02:08.240
here is 0.7 times ten to the minus three and I'll square that value.

02:08.670 --> 02:12.000
OK so that's the total volume and that's measured in meters cube.

02:12.410 --> 02:14.380
So I have a number for that.

02:14.470 --> 02:19.280
Our next thing we have to do now is figure out how many atoms do I have here how many copper atoms do

02:19.280 --> 02:20.970
I have per meter cube.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.280
So let's think about this just from the dimensions.

02:24.320 --> 02:31.130
So if you're given the density our density here is in grams per centimeter cube.

02:31.340 --> 02:31.730
All right.

02:31.730 --> 02:34.670
And I know that the molar mass is in grams per mole.

02:35.060 --> 02:42.800
So actually if I wanted to get rid of grams here I could do is I could do something like this I could

02:42.800 --> 02:50.430
do grams per mole and you'll see that here I got grams in the numerator here I have it in the denominator.

02:50.750 --> 02:56.720
So at the end here I'm going to get the number of miles per centimeter cube and I can do one more thing

02:56.720 --> 02:59.110
I want to really know where it is the number of atoms.

02:59.110 --> 03:00.050
Right.

03:00.170 --> 03:07.580
The overall goal number of atoms copper atoms per meter cube while we could first start by calculating

03:07.580 --> 03:10.630
per centimeter cube then I can convert it.

03:10.670 --> 03:15.430
So this first term here is the density This is eight point nine.

03:15.440 --> 03:21.830
Now this second term over here in grams per mole the second bracket over here if you wish is this smaller

03:21.830 --> 03:27.950
mass you got to be careful this is sixty three point five grams per mole.

03:28.070 --> 03:28.390
All right.

03:28.390 --> 03:30.890
And that takes care of these grams.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.920
Now I'm not quite there at the end I wanted to know how many atoms there are.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.530
Now all I know is how many moles per centimeter cube.

03:36.710 --> 03:41.960
But if I use Avogadro's number I think I can do that right because Avogadro's number is measured in

03:41.960 --> 03:46.280
the number of atoms we want to get rid of moles.

03:46.370 --> 03:48.980
So we have to have it like this.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.780
You introduce another bracket here.

03:51.020 --> 03:59.380
This here is simply Avogadro's number which is six point zero two times ten of the 23 atoms primal.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.440
And now you see the moles are going to cancel out.

04:01.460 --> 04:03.300
Moles are going to cancel out.

04:03.620 --> 04:08.600
And if I evaluate these three thing these three terms just multiply through well here you got to divide

04:08.630 --> 04:13.200
but at the end what you are going to get is the number of atoms percentage meter cube.

04:13.670 --> 04:19.710
I did this correctly it should get eight point four seven multiplied by 10 of the 22.

04:20.360 --> 04:27.890
And again this is an atoms per centimeter cube you can convert that right away to meter's cube.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.560
Let you do that again.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.670
Pretty straightforward.

04:30.680 --> 04:37.980
Eight point seven times ten to the twenty eight atoms per metre cube.

04:40.820 --> 04:41.200
All right.

04:41.210 --> 04:46.220
So now that we know that we know that each one now each of those Adam gives you one electron.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.490
So we now really have our charge density.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.850
All right.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.180
Let's write that out.

04:52.190 --> 05:02.300
So the charge density of the free electrons again charge density will be measured in cool ohms per metre

05:02.300 --> 05:05.670
cube.

05:05.700 --> 05:10.740
So what you need to do now is if I have something in atoms per metre cube I would need to multiply that

05:10.740 --> 05:17.070
by cool ohms per atom in order to get rid of that and that I know right because I know each atom gives

05:17.070 --> 05:18.170
me one electron.

05:18.180 --> 05:25.970
So you have to have 1.6 times tend the negative 19 cool ohms per annum.

05:26.190 --> 05:32.430
Thats the number of free electrons multiplied by the total number of atoms so this is going to be eight

05:32.430 --> 05:36.150
point four seven multiplied by 10 of the 28

05:38.720 --> 05:40.200
atoms per meter cube.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.550
All right you see that the atoms cancel out.

05:43.550 --> 05:49.800
And at the end my total kind of charge density for these free electrons I right is f e over here.

05:50.050 --> 05:57.230
If I did this correctly should give me one point three six times ten to the ten.

05:57.230 --> 06:00.930
Cool ohms perimeter cube.

06:00.990 --> 06:01.520
All right.

06:01.810 --> 06:05.080
So you want to know now is the total charge.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.570
Well again we know what our total volume is.

06:08.670 --> 06:08.930
All right.

06:08.930 --> 06:12.580
Because the length is one in our cross-sectional area was here.

06:13.020 --> 06:16.040
So what you can do now is if you want to determine what the total charges.

06:16.050 --> 06:22.590
Q Is you simply multiply this density that we just got the density of the free electrons multiplied

06:22.590 --> 06:24.570
by the volume.

06:24.570 --> 06:26.600
All right I'll let you carry that out.

06:26.610 --> 06:33.700
I did it and I found 2.8 multiplied by 10 of the four cool ohms perimeter.

06:33.870 --> 06:40.140
Again it's cool almost because we're really just looking at one meter here of wire.

06:40.430 --> 06:50.440
So on one meter of wire there's quite a bit of charge 2.8 times 10 of the four coulombs 28000 cool homes.

06:50.450 --> 06:50.720
All right.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.350
So this is these kind of the problems kind of come up pretty often.

06:54.560 --> 07:00.410
Again if you're given some information about the density typically just do some dimensional analysis

07:00.410 --> 07:06.820
to figure out how many kind of atoms do you actually have in a block of material.

07:07.040 --> 07:12.530
Now each atom has a lot more electrons but only some of them will contribute to the current.

07:12.530 --> 07:18.980
For copper it's typically one free electron per atom for silver for other materials it might be a slightly

07:18.980 --> 07:24.430
different number but it's not all of these electrons that contribute right.

07:24.440 --> 07:28.880
Not all of the copper electrons that are going to contribute to the current And I think that's the important

07:28.880 --> 07:29.830
point here.

07:30.240 --> 07:30.530
OK.

07:30.620 --> 07:35.450
So for Part B we're just asked to calculate what the drift philosophy is in the equations up here so

07:35.450 --> 07:39.560
let's just start with that and maybe just rearrange the equation a little bit so you can right that

07:39.560 --> 07:41.470
the drift velocity if you know the current.

07:41.630 --> 07:48.200
I know got to be a little bit careful how we have still our number density number of free electrons

07:48.680 --> 07:49.120
meters.

07:49.130 --> 07:55.130
Q multiplied by the charge of each one multiply by that cross-section which we know what this expression

07:55.130 --> 07:56.690
simplifies a little bit.

07:56.690 --> 08:02.420
Remember what this is a number of electrons per meter.

08:02.420 --> 08:09.830
Q And if you multiplied by the charge of each electron This basically is given me in the number of charges

08:09.920 --> 08:14.590
right the total charge and cool ohms per meter cube.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.090
Well I had that value right.

08:17.090 --> 08:19.090
I mean this is basically the total charge.

08:19.090 --> 08:26.230
Q divided by the volume which is the area multiplied by the length the length is 1 meter.

08:26.800 --> 08:27.240
OK.

08:27.440 --> 08:32.360
So let's just go ahead and just replace this right that's what any is any is basically the total charge

08:32.660 --> 08:35.550
divided by the total volume that I'm looking at.

08:35.570 --> 08:38.200
So all you have to do here is just multiply or just right.

08:38.210 --> 08:44.780
I say that if this guy were going to raise the total charge here and that 1 meter length of wire divided

08:44.780 --> 08:52.980
by a and multiply by 1 here I still have that definition which includes another area term over here.

08:53.240 --> 08:57.480
So you could see this simplifies a little bit those area terms cancel out.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.830
The length is one so you don't really have to worry about that.

09:01.130 --> 09:06.230
So all we're left with here is what is the current divided by basically the charge per unit length here

09:06.840 --> 09:09.310
the current for this problem here was 1 amp.

09:09.580 --> 09:16.740
So you get 1 divided by 2.8 times ten to the four.

09:16.810 --> 09:20.990
And this is going to be giving me my drift velocity so the drift velocity put that in the calculator

09:21.640 --> 09:28.320
which you get at the end is approximately 3.6 times ten of the minus 5.

09:28.400 --> 09:32.690
And since I've kept everything in S-I units I should get meters per second.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.250
At the end.

09:34.840 --> 09:35.760
OK.

09:35.870 --> 09:41.630
A lot of times you write these philosophies in millimeters per second just kind of get rid of some of

09:41.630 --> 09:42.850
those terms.

09:43.040 --> 09:48.640
So that's 3.6 times ten to the minus two that's in millimeters per second.

09:49.190 --> 09:53.530
So you can see that the drift velocity in kind of typical copper is extremely small.

09:53.540 --> 09:54.100
Right.
