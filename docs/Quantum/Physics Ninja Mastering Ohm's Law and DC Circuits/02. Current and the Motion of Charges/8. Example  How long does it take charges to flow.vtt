All right here's another kind of just simple example here says How long does it take so how long would

00:05.130 --> 00:09.440
it take for an electron to drift from your car battery to the starter motor.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.540
That distance is approximately 1 meter.

00:11.580 --> 00:17.680
And the drift speed similar to what we calculated 3.7 times tend of the negative 5.

00:17.730 --> 00:19.350
So this one's pretty straightforward right.

00:19.340 --> 00:26.430
We have an electron electron wants to travel a certain distance from the battery all the way to the

00:26.430 --> 00:27.450
starter motor.

00:27.690 --> 00:30.430
Let's say that distance is approximately 1 meter.

00:30.750 --> 00:34.380
Let's call that Delta X. We know that the speed here.

00:34.380 --> 00:39.450
This is the drift velocity v and all we want to do now is find the time.

00:39.570 --> 00:45.600
So VD would be a displacement divided by Delta T.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.780
How long it takes.

00:47.040 --> 00:55.480
So you rearrange this equation delta t simply delta x divided by this drift velocity.

00:56.030 --> 01:05.890
So you simply have one meter and divide that through by 3.7 times ten to the five meters per second.

01:06.410 --> 01:13.030
At the end of the day put that in a calculator we get 2.7 multiplied times ten to the four seconds.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.120
That doesn't tell me a lot.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.000
Other than it's a really big number right.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.050
27000 seconds.

01:18.590 --> 01:21.190
Let's convert that maybe see how many hours that is.

01:21.200 --> 01:27.020
So we have 2.7 times ten of the four seconds.

01:27.020 --> 01:31.050
We start with seconds at the end I want to get rid of seconds.

01:32.350 --> 01:35.420
And I want to get ours in one hour.

01:35.420 --> 01:42.610
I know there is 60 Minutes and in each minute there's 60 seconds so you get something like this.

01:42.770 --> 01:47.280
That gives me approximately seven point five hours to do that on the calculator.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.690
So that's pretty remarkable right for an electron to go from the motor to your battery.

01:52.810 --> 01:54.610
It takes seven and a half hours.

01:54.770 --> 01:57.990
So the drift velocity is very very slow.

01:58.370 --> 02:05.480
It's just what the take home message is with this example the individual velocity of an electron in

02:05.480 --> 02:09.170
a conductor or just due to thermal motion is very high.

02:09.170 --> 02:11.930
However the drif philosophy is very low.
