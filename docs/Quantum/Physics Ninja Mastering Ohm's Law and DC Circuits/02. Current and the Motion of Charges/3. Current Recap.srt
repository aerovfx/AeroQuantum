00:00.240 --> 00:00.460
All right.

00:00.480 --> 00:02.610
So here's our kind of important summary here.

00:02.730 --> 00:09.570
Definition of the current flow of charge the rate at which charge moves or flows past some point per

00:09.570 --> 00:10.340
unit time.

00:10.510 --> 00:13.940
OK current is measured in cool ohms per second.

00:14.010 --> 00:17.370
We refer that as being an ampere an amp.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.000
Sometimes you just use the letter A.

00:20.070 --> 00:26.180
So one cool on per second is equivalent to 1 amp and looking at the microscopic.

00:26.190 --> 00:32.610
If we're looking at electrons moving in a conductor the definition of the current If you look at all

00:32.610 --> 00:38.750
the charges that could move through this conductor you can write it in terms of different properties.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.360
You can read it in terms of a charge density how many electrons are free to move per unit volume of

00:45.360 --> 00:53.340
the conductor multiplied by the charge of each electron multiplied by the cross-section of my wire.

00:53.430 --> 00:58.720
Typically these are circles so typically have like a PI are squared for the area.

00:58.750 --> 01:04.430
You can calculate that in the last term here is this drift velocity.

01:04.720 --> 01:05.030
OK.

01:05.190 --> 01:09.120
How fast are those electrons moving in this conductor.

01:09.540 --> 01:16.710
Now there's drif velocity again if I go back to my back to basics slide right how fast the electrons

01:16.710 --> 01:21.100
moving it really depends on how big that electric field is.

01:21.110 --> 01:23.590
All right Ed we'll see in a minute.

01:23.610 --> 01:30.150
When we look at what's going on it also depends on other aspects because these electrons although they

01:30.150 --> 01:34.810
accelerate a little bit they will and they will encounter other electrons.

01:34.950 --> 01:40.360
They'll also encounter positive ions and they're basically going to collide.

01:40.650 --> 01:45.310
So they don't just accelerate forever and then this term just gets bigger and bigger.

01:45.450 --> 01:46.350
So let's have a look.

01:46.380 --> 01:49.290
Let's zoom into a wire and see what it looks like.
