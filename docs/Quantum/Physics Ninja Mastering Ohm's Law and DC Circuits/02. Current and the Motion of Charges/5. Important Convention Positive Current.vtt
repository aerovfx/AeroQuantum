All right there's something I want to mention here in passing.

00:04.030 --> 00:10.990
There is an important convention in electric circuits that sometimes often overlooked.

00:11.080 --> 00:15.300
It's probably not that important but I just wanted to just mention it again and again and we have our

00:15.300 --> 00:18.970
electric field here pointing from the right hand side to the left hand side.

00:19.020 --> 00:24.230
We've discussed that we have electrons flowing in the opposite direction.

00:24.600 --> 00:24.960
Right.

00:24.990 --> 00:26.300
So we have electrons

00:29.920 --> 00:31.920
kind of moving in this direction.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.460
That is the direction of the drift velocity.

00:35.470 --> 00:45.270
Now what we're going to define as I later on in our circuits we call this the positive electric current

00:50.210 --> 00:56.240
in the positive electric current is always opposite of the electron flow.

01:00.550 --> 01:01.750
Opposite of

01:04.720 --> 01:06.540
electron flow.

01:07.390 --> 01:13.830
So in this case the current I actually goes in this direction and it makes a lot of sense if you have

01:13.830 --> 01:17.490
negative charges moving from left to right.

01:17.610 --> 01:24.260
It's kind of the same thing as having a positive current moving from right to left right.

01:24.330 --> 01:27.420
Negative charges while you're going to leave some positive on this side.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.280
It's kind of like there's a build up of positive charges on this side.

01:30.420 --> 01:30.910
OK.

01:30.990 --> 01:37.080
So just keep that in mind that the current or the direction of the current eye is really opposite of

01:37.140 --> 01:39.580
the motion of the electrons.
