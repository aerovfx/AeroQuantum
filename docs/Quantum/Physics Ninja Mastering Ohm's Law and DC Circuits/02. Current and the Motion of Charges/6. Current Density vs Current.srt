00:00.660 --> 00:00.960
All right.

00:00.960 --> 00:05.630
So remember we had we had our electrons here that were in this copper wire.

00:06.150 --> 00:11.850
So I want to see a few things about another term that I think comes up here is current density.

00:11.850 --> 00:13.960
So again these were kind of drifting along.

00:14.190 --> 00:19.490
And that means if I have electrons flowing from the left to the right I have a positive current flowing

00:19.530 --> 00:22.150
in the opposite direction that was the convention.

00:22.180 --> 00:26.130
I often define a term called the current density.

00:26.130 --> 00:28.760
The letter used for current density is J.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.820
So it's called this the current density.

00:33.610 --> 00:37.650
And for the purposes of this class we are just going to consider kind of simple cases where we have

00:37.650 --> 00:40.230
a constant density Throughout the same.

00:40.230 --> 00:46.630
So there's the same number of charges kind of going from or crossing near the top of the wires the bottom.

00:46.740 --> 00:47.160
OK.

00:47.310 --> 00:52.420
And the definition of the current density if this density is constant is simply the total current

00:56.900 --> 00:58.580
divided by the total area.

01:03.150 --> 01:05.340
So that's the definition of the current density.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.640
So for this particular case again total current is usually just written as I.

01:09.690 --> 01:14.250
The total area here we're looking at the cross-sectional area that we're looking at the charges moving

01:14.250 --> 01:14.940
through.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.910
So in this case it was simply a.

01:17.220 --> 01:23.700
So for our case here the current density for this particular case you just bring on the other side what

01:23.700 --> 01:33.570
you're left with is this charge density the charge of each electron multiplied by the philosophy.

01:33.630 --> 01:34.360
Right.

01:34.380 --> 01:39.390
That is simply the current divided by the units now of current density.

01:39.390 --> 01:46.320
Pretty straightforward have to be measured in units of amps per the units of the area or meters squared

01:46.320 --> 01:49.080
if you want to work in Esai units.

01:49.920 --> 01:55.140
And conversely if somebody gives you the current density J and you want it to find what the total current

01:55.140 --> 01:55.790
is.

01:56.010 --> 02:02.220
Well again if you know a as you can find the total current simply by multiplying the current density

02:02.220 --> 02:03.880
multiplied by the area.

02:04.270 --> 02:04.780
OK.

02:04.860 --> 02:09.150
Now I think we get a little bit more complicated if the current density is not constant.

02:09.150 --> 02:15.270
This is true if it's constant and the area is kind of perpendicular to the flow of the current density

02:16.020 --> 02:18.540
it could get more complicated more advanced books.

02:18.720 --> 02:23.340
Sometimes you might see that the current density you'd have to if the current density wasn't constant

02:23.340 --> 02:25.730
you'd actually have to integrate over something like this.

02:25.740 --> 02:27.950
But this is more advanced topic.

02:27.960 --> 02:28.520
OK.

02:28.680 --> 02:33.660
We basically just consider cases where there's the same number of same current density everywhere throughout

02:33.660 --> 02:40.840
this cross-section here and also the cross-sections always kind of perpendicular to our current density.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.320
OK so let's keep things simple and just takes a very simple definition.
