00:00.330 --> 00:07.170
Now you walk into any Home Depot over the weekend and you go try to buy some copper wire go into the

00:07.170 --> 00:14.490
electrical section and the copper wire that you're looking for has a certain size that's recommended

00:14.490 --> 00:16.000
by your electrician.

00:16.350 --> 00:21.260
Typically if you have a bigger cross-section you can have more current flowing through it.

00:21.270 --> 00:25.140
However again now you have to worry about how much resistance there is.

00:25.140 --> 00:26.140
Right.

00:26.160 --> 00:31.440
The bigger the cross-section the smaller the overall resistance of that will be a determination for

00:31.440 --> 00:38.010
your house into what kind of wire you're looking for wires in those common hardware stores are listed

00:38.010 --> 00:44.740
in kind of these units over here this is AWG which refers to the American wire gauge

00:47.560 --> 00:55.110
and it's simply a standardized method of calculating the diameters in cross-sectional areas of wires.

00:55.750 --> 01:02.560
So American wire gauge is listed using these integer numbers.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.180
There might be other ones here.

01:04.450 --> 01:11.220
Number four refers to a wire that has a diameter of a little bit over five millimeters.

01:11.320 --> 01:18.100
If you know the diameter you can calculate the cross-section as you increase the wire gauge number.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.950
Look what happens to the diameter.

01:20.110 --> 01:29.170
So a wire gauge that has a 20 listed under the American wire gauge is very very small compared to a

01:29.170 --> 01:31.320
wire that has a 4.

01:31.570 --> 01:37.030
So for a four you can handle a lot more amperage much higher values of the currents can go through the

01:37.030 --> 01:41.850
four rather than 20 for example.

01:42.220 --> 01:47.300
Again the resistance of any wire depends on what it's made from.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.200
This will be copper for all of these different wires.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.070
Depends on the length.

01:51.080 --> 01:56.200
Well that'll depend on whatever application you need but it also depends on that cross-sectional area

01:56.200 --> 01:58.560
and that's where this comes from.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.190
OK.

01:59.380 --> 02:05.950
So then the formula that links this number here for the wire gauge number that's the number and to the

02:05.950 --> 02:10.160
actual diameter and millimeters is given by this equation actually I found this on the web.

02:10.300 --> 02:13.180
I don't know exactly what the history is behind this.

02:13.180 --> 02:17.320
It's kind of interesting I thought I'd write it down and I checked it out and it works for a lot of

02:17.320 --> 02:18.790
those.

02:19.390 --> 02:24.490
So anyway just a little bit of background that if you go into a hardware store typically the wires are

02:24.880 --> 02:29.500
listed with this number this AWG number and that's all that it means it just refers to a particular

02:29.500 --> 02:30.550
diameter.

02:30.550 --> 02:32.850
And this is the relationship that links them together.
