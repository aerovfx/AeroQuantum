00:00.360 --> 00:01.970
All right let's try this example out.

00:02.010 --> 00:04.300
Pretty simple we have a resistor over here.

00:04.590 --> 00:07.000
Let's calculate the value of the resistance.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.930
So first of all it's a four band.

00:10.290 --> 00:14.080
And notice the lines are more closely spaced at the top.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.030
So we're going to read in this direction down here.

00:17.430 --> 00:23.110
So the first one we get is a Brown Brown has a digit of 1 the first digit should be 1.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.910
Then we have green the second digit should be five.

00:27.390 --> 00:28.970
Then we have orange.

00:29.020 --> 00:32.310
OK so again now again it's only four bands.

00:32.310 --> 00:35.410
So that means the third band tells you the multiplier.

00:35.520 --> 00:36.840
And again that's the thousand.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.070
So this is 15 Kila.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.270
And then plus or minus.

00:41.280 --> 00:46.410
Then we get a silver down here the silver for the tolerance is written over here with plus or minus

00:46.410 --> 00:49.570
10 percent 10 percent.

00:49.570 --> 00:56.510
So really I could write this as 15000 ohms plus or minus 1500.

00:56.970 --> 01:01.910
That's 10 percent of 15000.

01:02.220 --> 01:05.270
That would be the value of this resistance here.

01:05.550 --> 01:06.950
Pretty straightforward.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.320
Just needs a bit of practice.
