00:00.120 --> 00:04.290
All right in this example here you want to see if you can calculate the resistance.

00:04.290 --> 00:11.270
So let's see if you can calculate the resistance of 3 meters of 14 gauge copper wire.

00:11.320 --> 00:15.850
You can hit pause right now and see if you can go ahead and calculate what the overall total resistance

00:15.850 --> 00:17.540
is of this wire.

00:17.970 --> 00:20.230
I'm looking for that value right there.

00:21.100 --> 00:21.520
Oh yeah.

00:21.570 --> 00:28.380
Well the way I would do it again just recalling that it's the resistivity multiplied by the length and

00:28.390 --> 00:30.880
divided by the cross-sectional area.

00:30.960 --> 00:39.970
So as the copper wire for gauge 14 if you go look it up you can find in the previous slide here you

00:39.970 --> 00:47.500
could find what the value of the diameter is and the value of the diameter for this wire is 1.6 to 8

00:48.190 --> 00:49.220
millimeters.

00:49.450 --> 00:53.250
So that's 10 of the minus 3 meters.

00:53.260 --> 00:58.710
That means you can go ahead and write down the area the area is pi are squared.

00:58.750 --> 01:06.030
If you want to write it in terms of the diameter pi d squared over four.

01:06.270 --> 01:10.380
OK so you can go ahead and calculate that value in meters squared.

01:10.390 --> 01:14.440
Now the value of the resistivity while the resistance of copper.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.150
See you look it up.

01:16.150 --> 01:24.020
I just wrote it down in the previous table to 1.7 times 10 to the minus 8 0 meters.

01:24.860 --> 01:28.490
Our length is very straight forward three.

01:28.700 --> 01:36.560
And now we know what the cross-section is based on the fact that it's a 14 gauge wire.

01:36.590 --> 01:40.880
So now you plug everything into our resistance equation.

01:41.000 --> 01:49.210
One point seven times ten to the minus eight multiplied by the length which is three.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.410
All of this gets divided now by the cross-sectional area which is pi.

01:53.720 --> 02:01.970
The diameter is one point six to eight times ten to the minus three and divided by four Let me just

02:02.090 --> 02:04.210
put the four upstairs over here.

02:04.250 --> 02:12.490
All right I went through and I calculated that and I got zero point zero to 5 ohms kind of nice to write

02:12.520 --> 02:13.970
that as 25.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.540
Move the decimal over three spots.

02:16.540 --> 02:19.770
So that's 25 million ohms.

02:20.090 --> 02:27.710
That should be the total resistance so pretty small but it's only 3 meters and it's got a pretty big

02:27.710 --> 02:30.320
cross section.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.580
And what else.

02:31.660 --> 02:33.650
Well the resistivity is very very small right.

02:33.690 --> 02:34.980
We're just looking at copper wire.

02:34.990 --> 02:36.260
So it's not the end of the world.
