00:00.330 --> 00:06.270
All right the electric circuits that we're going to see in a little bit are going to contain wires but

00:06.270 --> 00:13.110
they're also going to contain electrical components called resistors and resistors although every every

00:13.110 --> 00:15.510
wire has a particular resistance.

00:15.510 --> 00:18.630
The value of the resistors tend to be much higher.

00:18.630 --> 00:23.940
The wires themselves for example copper wire that's a meter long has an overall resistance that is very

00:23.940 --> 00:25.170
very small.

00:25.170 --> 00:29.560
We might want to put other types of resistors in our circuit.

00:29.970 --> 00:35.400
And which values are much bigger than the resistance of the actual wire that's connecting it to the

00:35.400 --> 00:36.630
battery.

00:36.630 --> 00:42.330
Some of these resistors if you're kind of a hobbyist in electronics a lot of the resistors kind of look

00:42.810 --> 00:46.650
like the one shown here in this diagram.

00:46.650 --> 00:51.370
One thing you notice is there are all these color codes on the various resistors.

00:51.390 --> 00:56.190
These are all different values are going to show you how to analyze these different color codes and

00:56.190 --> 01:00.780
how to come up with a value of the resistance of this particular resistor.

01:01.050 --> 01:05.750
And how do you calculate it measured in ohms at the end of the day.

01:05.850 --> 01:10.650
In some cases the actual value of the resistance is simply written right on it.

01:10.670 --> 01:11.180
OK.

01:11.220 --> 01:15.960
Actually you're right it would have been hard to see here but you see the ohms sign over here this one

01:15.960 --> 01:21.100
also this is a 4 ohm resistor and then it also lists some tolerance here.

01:21.150 --> 01:26.850
These are probably some ceramics but we want to be able to look at any type of kind of component if

01:26.850 --> 01:33.360
you look at electrical circuit board you might see some of these types of components on those boards

01:33.360 --> 01:36.080
and these are simply resistance values.

01:36.330 --> 01:42.150
So let's go ahead now and show you how to calculate what is the actual value of the resistance of a

01:42.150 --> 01:43.940
component like this.

01:43.950 --> 01:49.530
All right if I go now and look at some actual resistors you look back on the previous page you'll notice

01:49.530 --> 01:52.290
that some of them had four different colors.

01:52.290 --> 01:56.180
Some of them had five and some of them even have six.

01:56.190 --> 02:00.840
So the way you interpret these now all we need two things First we need to know which each one of these

02:00.840 --> 02:01.570
colors.

02:01.650 --> 02:02.760
What do they mean.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.930
And then we need to know which direction do we actually read do we start on the left side or the right

02:06.930 --> 02:08.800
side and how do we do that.

02:08.850 --> 02:12.240
So let's start with the direction that you would read any of these.

02:12.560 --> 02:18.560
Notice on one side that the bands are closer together and on one side then there's a larger gap.

02:18.570 --> 02:22.920
And then there's more space even for the six band and this is that the left hand side the bands are

02:22.920 --> 02:24.060
closer together.

02:24.120 --> 02:29.280
And as I move toward the right side of the resistor notice the bands are farther apart.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.990
So you always start with the side where the bands are closer together.

02:33.990 --> 02:40.920
So for all of these We're going to start on this side now if we're looking at a four band resistor and

02:40.920 --> 02:42.870
I want to calculate what the resistance is.

02:42.870 --> 02:44.610
It's very very simple.

02:44.880 --> 02:50.240
Some of the bands refer to the digits and the digits will show you what that means in a second image

02:50.270 --> 02:51.510
just kind of get rid of this.

02:51.510 --> 02:52.080
All right.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.030
So let's start with the four band receivers.

02:54.030 --> 02:57.380
I start at the first first one here on the left hand side it's red.

02:57.720 --> 03:04.320
So I follow the dashed line down each color represents a number for red over here.

03:04.320 --> 03:05.400
What do I get.

03:05.490 --> 03:06.930
It represents the number two.

03:06.970 --> 03:09.130
I write the number two over here.

03:09.750 --> 03:13.080
That's the first digit of the resistance.

03:13.260 --> 03:15.340
The next band now is a green.

03:15.360 --> 03:17.110
Go to the second digit.

03:17.370 --> 03:20.970
It represents the number five.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.100
The third.

03:22.110 --> 03:27.420
Now if I'm only looking at a 4 band the third band represents the multiplier.

03:27.420 --> 03:31.700
So it means it's a number that's going to multiply this 25.

03:31.710 --> 03:33.120
So in this case it's orange.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.690
So let's follow down the multiplier color scale is over here.

03:37.260 --> 03:41.440
And if it's orange it represents 1 k 1 k means 1000.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.760
So that's multiplied by 1000 and that's it.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.100
I'm actually with the first three bands if there's only four of them.

03:48.210 --> 03:52.450
That is the value of the resistance and that should be at times a thousand not a 100.

03:52.500 --> 03:57.640
So that means that this guy here is 25 Kila Ohmes.

03:57.900 --> 04:01.730
Now the fourth band here represents the tolerance.

04:01.780 --> 04:06.660
Now if you go to the tolerance color scale which is over here in this case it looks like it's more of

04:06.660 --> 04:07.390
a gold.

04:07.560 --> 04:17.250
So that tells me that plus or minus that's the uncertainty on the value of the resistance is 5 percent.

04:17.280 --> 04:19.810
So that gives you approximately 1250.

04:19.830 --> 04:20.460
Right.

04:20.550 --> 04:28.760
So the value of the resistance if you wanted to write it as 25000 homes plus or minus let's say while

04:28.770 --> 04:30.770
I may just write it all.

04:31.020 --> 04:35.760
Not to worry about the significant figures here I probably wouldn't write an uncertainty with this many

04:35.760 --> 04:39.780
significant figures but just to highlight how you would write data.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.110
Okay.

04:41.310 --> 04:45.900
So that's all there is if there's four band now if there's five bands you got to be a bit more careful.

04:46.320 --> 04:52.050
If there's five bands the first three of them actually refer to the digits.

04:52.230 --> 04:58.020
And then after that the fourth band of the five band color code represents the multiplier and the last

04:58.020 --> 05:00.920
one is a tolerance here or the fifth one.

05:00.960 --> 05:05.890
So let's go ahead and calculate what is the resistance of this five band resistor.

05:06.270 --> 05:11.010
Well the first one is yellow so the yellow first digit means it's four.

05:11.750 --> 05:12.530
It's easy.

05:12.660 --> 05:13.950
The second digit is a blue.

05:13.950 --> 05:16.860
So I go down here that's a 6.

05:16.860 --> 05:17.970
Now I got to be careful now.

05:17.970 --> 05:23.850
The third band because there's five of them the third band doesn't necessarily tell me the multiplier.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.740
It simply refers to the third digit.

05:27.270 --> 05:30.130
Since it's black that's the number 0.

05:30.360 --> 05:36.270
The fourth band now if it's a five band color code the fourth band represents the multiplier in this

05:36.270 --> 05:38.620
case it's orange so it's also a thousand.

05:38.820 --> 05:40.900
So that means it's also kill.

05:42.980 --> 05:46.120
It now well the last one represents the tolerance here.

05:46.120 --> 05:51.870
The tolerance is approximately this doesn't look like gold to me it looks more like brown it looks closer

05:51.870 --> 05:53.500
to plus or minus 1 percent.

05:55.650 --> 05:59.510
All right let's try to figure out what this last one is the 6 band color code.

05:59.640 --> 06:06.480
Now the six band refers to some temperature coefficient and I wouldn't be too concerned about that.

06:06.570 --> 06:12.380
Let's just calculate what the value of the resistance is based on the first five bands.

06:12.870 --> 06:19.710
So again we're going to have the first three are going to represent the digits the fourth one represents

06:19.710 --> 06:25.110
a multiplier and the fifth one will represent a tolerance.

06:25.140 --> 06:33.360
So when we write down for the 6 band one well first start at the red the red represents a two.

06:33.740 --> 06:40.110
What about the next one the next one looks like it's kind of like a purplish that looks like maybe seven

06:40.160 --> 06:43.020
Dimi seven.

06:43.120 --> 06:47.880
The next one is definitely blue so that's a six to 76.

06:47.890 --> 06:49.650
The fourth Bane is the multiplier.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.650
All look what we get here.

06:50.650 --> 06:52.210
Now it's black.

06:52.210 --> 06:52.840
What does that mean.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.170
The multiplier is simply one.

06:55.660 --> 06:56.590
Well that means I'm done.

06:56.590 --> 06:59.940
So that's 276 ohms.

06:59.950 --> 07:06.220
So you could see you can cover a lot of different values of the resistor simply by having these different

07:06.220 --> 07:07.610
color for the multiplier.

07:07.620 --> 07:13.010
So right now I mean having a thousand there makes these resistance is much bigger than this one.

07:13.010 --> 07:17.950
All right now what is the last one the last one here is the tolerance tolerance again this one looks

07:17.950 --> 07:25.630
more like gold to me the gold tolerance is plus or minus 5 percent.

07:25.650 --> 07:32.670
This one here would also have a temperature coefficient which looks kind of not the clearest but it

07:32.670 --> 07:34.540
would be 100 ppm again.

07:35.010 --> 07:39.810
Not 100 percent sure what this means but it's not a big concern as long as we can calculate what the

07:42.330 --> 07:47.200
what the values of the resistances are and what the value of the tolerances were in pretty good shape.
