WEBVTT

00:00.150 --> 00:04.260
All right let's kind of look at the units of everything involved here just to kind of start making sense

00:04.260 --> 00:05.240
of everything.

00:05.700 --> 00:16.700
So we had I k Iowas simply current and that was measured in amps and one amp was one cool on per second.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.180
All right what else.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.630
We had a current density.

00:21.770 --> 00:26.850
This was a simple formula was total current divided by total area.

00:27.380 --> 00:32.110
So this was measured in amps per meter squared.

00:33.770 --> 00:39.240
Put a square bracket whenever I'm kind of discussing the units about about a quantity.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.020
Well what else do we have.

00:41.060 --> 00:44.390
We have electric field field.

00:44.400 --> 00:51.200
The electric field is measured in units of volts per meter.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.280
What else I introduce that quantity called

01:00.460 --> 01:03.710
resistivity resistivity.

01:03.760 --> 01:11.170
Well what is the simple equation for a resistivity its was the constant of proportionality between the

01:11.170 --> 01:15.280
electric field strength and our current density.

01:15.760 --> 01:24.070
So that means that our equation for Roe must be equal the E divided by the current density.

01:24.820 --> 01:26.670
All right so now let's simplify this.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.230
So the units for e are volt meter

01:33.090 --> 01:43.060
and the units of J were current which was amps per meter squared.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.010
All right we can cross out one of these meters here.

01:46.110 --> 01:55.020
So we're left with this guy here in the square bracket of volt per amp multiplied by a meter.

01:55.080 --> 02:01.710
Actually this guy here can simplify and let's go to the definition of resistance resistance the equation

02:01.710 --> 02:09.750
that we had was that the voltage or the difference of potential was equal to the resistance multiplied

02:09.750 --> 02:10.440
by the current.

02:10.440 --> 02:10.660
Right.

02:10.660 --> 02:13.210
These were two forms of Ohms law.

02:13.770 --> 02:16.610
So if I isolate for resistance.

02:16.950 --> 02:20.560
So I say equal but I really mean a little arrow there.

02:20.610 --> 02:27.830
So the value of the resistance can be written as V divided by.

02:28.070 --> 02:30.990
So if you look at this guy now looks pretty similar to one of those terms.

02:30.990 --> 02:42.660
This is voltage divided by amperes by amps group actually we define this as being an olm.

02:42.660 --> 02:46.700
We call this an ohm and the symbol we use for that.

02:46.710 --> 02:54.390
You've probably seen this kind of this symbol over here than upper case omega that's the symbol we give

02:54.390 --> 02:56.070
for resistance.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.360
So now if I go back to my resistivity.

02:59.610 --> 03:06.110
So that's what you call one ohm is 1 volt per ampere So you see both of those are kind of linked together.

03:06.270 --> 03:14.860
So actually the more common unit we see for resistivity is then simply written as an old.

03:15.150 --> 03:18.820
That's the volt per ampere multiplied by a meter.

03:19.410 --> 03:27.390
So resistivity is often written only in terms of 0 meters like this which are the quantities that we

03:27.390 --> 03:28.180
have.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.580
I think we've pretty much have everything here.

03:30.600 --> 03:34.350
Now let me just also mention something so I said everything here.

03:34.410 --> 03:41.420
Both of these equations were versions of Ohm's law the value Roe.

03:41.610 --> 03:45.570
This is a material property.

03:45.800 --> 03:52.140
So you can look it up different materials will have different values of resistivity.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.310
Now you might have heard of something called the conductivity.

03:56.310 --> 03:56.570
Right.

03:56.630 --> 04:00.290
Let me just right ro here is just reminding you this is resistivity

04:05.740 --> 04:10.240
you might have heard about something called the conductivity.

04:10.510 --> 04:15.940
When you're talking about conductors you'd expect the resistivity to be pretty small because conductors

04:16.690 --> 04:20.710
tend to be pretty good at conducting electrons.

04:20.710 --> 04:23.260
But there's something called conductivity.

04:23.650 --> 04:30.700
And usually they use the letters Sigma for that last letter over here actually and it's pretty straightforward.

04:30.700 --> 04:36.540
It's related to the resistivity and it's just the reciprocal of the resists devotee.

04:37.120 --> 04:43.260
So that means if you know the reason civets you automatically know the kind activity.

04:43.790 --> 04:49.340
And there is I just want to mention this is because sometimes Ohm's law here is written kind of like

04:49.340 --> 04:50.530
this.

04:51.020 --> 04:54.590
Most of the time as we are going to apply it like this.

04:54.980 --> 05:00.350
But if you use the definition of the conductivity every now and then instead of writing it like the

05:00.350 --> 05:09.190
first form what we're going to do is you're going to replace the resistivity by one divided by the conductivity.

05:09.190 --> 05:15.770
And some people like to write it like this and then just to get rid of the term in the denominator here.

05:15.790 --> 05:21.810
You're right that the current density is equal to the conductivity multiplied by the electric field.

05:22.180 --> 05:27.550
The Joe equation I like to call it.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.160
All right.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.830
So we have pretty much everything here I think.

05:31.830 --> 05:32.310
All right.

05:32.430 --> 05:36.870
Other quantities Well there was also the was the voltage right.

05:37.110 --> 05:44.830
You can break down a Volt and two more fundamental units if you want it to one volt is a jewel per Coolum

05:46.710 --> 05:52.980
was a definition of a volt if you go back to electrostatics and you can break the jewel down into more

05:52.980 --> 05:55.060
fundamental units as well.

05:55.560 --> 06:02.840
At the end of the day everything can be broken down into kilograms meters seconds coulombs.

06:03.450 --> 06:07.990
So these are just some of the important relations that kind of link all of these things together.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.750
So ohms law there's really three different ways to write it for the rest of this course we're really

06:12.750 --> 06:15.720
going to mainly focus on this guy right here.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.680
But just be aware that other things exist out there.
