Art I mentioned before that for Olmec resistors you can write the total resistance as the material property

00:07.300 --> 00:12.060
the resistivity multiplied by the length divided by the area.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.850
And this first term the resistivity was really a property of materials.

00:16.860 --> 00:23.200
So what I've got here a resistivity values resistivity values are usually quartered at some temperature.

00:23.340 --> 00:30.300
They were the units in meters and on the left hand side here we have the resistivity for conductors.

00:30.540 --> 00:36.420
Again for conductors you'd expect it to be pretty small down over here on the right hand side have got

00:36.420 --> 00:37.880
different materials Semiconductor.

00:37.890 --> 00:40.930
And let's just compare it to insulators for now for example.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.470
Compare copper to wood.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.980
All right wood doesn't do well if you put it into a circuit.

00:47.300 --> 00:54.500
It's resistivity is these values here tend to the eight to 10 to 14 depending on which kind of wood

00:54.500 --> 00:55.610
you're looking at.

00:55.610 --> 01:03.230
Compare that to copper copper is a very good conductor its value of the resistivity is extremely low

01:03.290 --> 01:08.970
compared to would tend to the minus 8 0 meters.

01:09.250 --> 01:14.470
You can compare copper now to some of the other more common used conductors.

01:14.470 --> 01:16.380
Silver is a pretty good conductor.

01:16.450 --> 01:19.450
Resistivity is a little bit lower than that of copper.

01:19.450 --> 01:22.920
They also have aluminum a little bit higher but still pretty low.

01:22.960 --> 01:29.550
Again they're all in the range of 10 of the negative 8 here whereas the insulators are very very high.

01:29.950 --> 01:32.030
Rubber tended at 16 right.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.650
There is no charge conduction.

01:33.700 --> 01:37.010
Right very very little because the resistance is so high.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.720
So the current would be very very small.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.530
Or if you think about Ohm's law now you rearrange Ohm's law.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.940
You start with vehicles that are I.

01:47.380 --> 01:55.330
However if you think about it now the amount of current that you get for a potential difference is going

01:55.330 --> 01:57.260
to be divided by our.

01:57.580 --> 02:02.090
So if I make the resistance very very big Clearly I'm going to get very small current right so he'd

02:02.110 --> 02:08.140
get very small current with any of these insulators compared to the conductor elements.

02:08.170 --> 02:11.470
Now I just want to say one more thing here about this quantity over here.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.290
We notice the value here is listed at 20 degrees Celsius.

02:15.340 --> 02:19.900
In reality you can change that value add value depends on temperature.

02:20.140 --> 02:25.390
And for most of the materials if you plot the resistivity versus the absolute temperature you kind of

02:25.390 --> 02:30.130
get a value where even at absolute zero you're going to get some resistivity because you will have some

02:30.130 --> 02:34.540
of those collisions between the electrons and the ions.

02:34.880 --> 02:40.840
But generally what tends to happen at least for conductors is it's pretty linear relationship over a

02:40.840 --> 02:43.240
broad range of temperatures.

02:43.570 --> 02:48.340
So B is kind of proportional to T after a while.

02:48.340 --> 02:54.170
Anyway that's one way you can actually increase the resistance of the material is to make it hotter.

02:54.170 --> 02:58.690
All right if the temperature gets hotter the resistivity goes up the length in the area.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.800
Don't change a little bit there I mean there might be a little bit of thermal expansion.

03:01.810 --> 03:07.750
But the main impact will probably be on the resistivity and that's how you can change the electrical

03:07.750 --> 03:09.100
properties of resistors.
