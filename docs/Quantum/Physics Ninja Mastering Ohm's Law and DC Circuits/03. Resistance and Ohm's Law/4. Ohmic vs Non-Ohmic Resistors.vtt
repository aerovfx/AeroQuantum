00:00.440 --> 00:07.170
Let me just highlight some language that's often used to characterize resisters or relationships.

00:07.170 --> 00:14.070
The graph here on the left hand side shows you a plot of voltage versus current for a particular resistance.

00:14.070 --> 00:18.430
Again this is what we call an Olmec resistor.

00:18.540 --> 00:21.410
Remember our here does not depend on the voltage.

00:21.510 --> 00:23.160
R does not depend on the current.

00:23.160 --> 00:33.730
You simply get a linear relationship here and R is equal to over I and that's it.

00:33.740 --> 00:41.460
You're going to get the same value irrespective of which point you pick on this curve.

00:41.480 --> 00:47.420
Now the graph here on the right hand side this refers to a non omic anything that is not a straight

00:47.420 --> 00:56.060
line that goes through the origin refers to as a non omic at any point along this orange curve.

00:56.360 --> 01:00.890
You can calculate what a resistances I can go over here.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.030
I can look at what the voltage reading is.

01:03.050 --> 01:09.050
I can look at what the current is and I could say that the resistance at this value is given by V over

01:09.050 --> 01:10.170
I.

01:11.390 --> 01:20.120
Sometimes you can set a slope equal to that point however you notice here that if I use this point or

01:20.120 --> 01:27.260
if I use this point I'm actually going to get a different value for the resistance and that is because

01:27.320 --> 01:34.560
in this case the resistance is not independent of voltage and current.

01:34.620 --> 01:40.590
So this is what is referred to as a non omic for the materials that we're basically going to look at

01:40.590 --> 01:44.600
or really going to focus our attention in this class on omic cases.

01:44.760 --> 01:50.090
But non-OEM cases could be diodes could be semiconductors.

01:50.100 --> 01:56.450
In any case where this this line here this relationship is not a straight line.
