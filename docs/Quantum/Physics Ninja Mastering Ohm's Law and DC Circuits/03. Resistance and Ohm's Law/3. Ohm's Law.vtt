00:00.210 --> 00:03.210
All right let's go back to this picture now of our conductor.

00:03.210 --> 00:11.640
So the ohms law that we're really going to focus on tells me that the voltage which again is always

00:11.640 --> 00:15.370
a difference of potential V.A mine is VB.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.910
There will be is proportional to the amount of current.

00:19.950 --> 00:25.000
Let me just write that down for us V is proportional to the amount of current that I get.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.790
So that means if I double the voltage I double the current.

00:30.020 --> 00:35.830
If I make the voltage difference five times bigger I'm going to get five times more current.

00:35.870 --> 00:42.170
Now to turn this proportionality into an equation you introduce the concept of the resistance that is

00:42.170 --> 00:50.500
the constant of proportionality that links the voltage to the current in that wire.

00:51.550 --> 00:52.090
OK.

00:52.820 --> 00:56.250
Now if we have something called a Olmec resistor

01:01.740 --> 01:09.500
an Olmec resistor means that are does not depend on the voltage and R does not depend on the current.

01:09.780 --> 01:17.160
If you have this it simply means that my resistance can be written as a property of the material that

01:17.160 --> 01:23.730
it's made from is it made from copper as is made from silver or any other conductor or some insulator.

01:23.730 --> 01:30.120
That is my resistivity value multiplied by a geometrical factor and the geometrical factor is the length

01:30.930 --> 01:33.160
divided by the area.

01:33.960 --> 01:39.000
Notice here this doesn't depend on on the voltage.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.050
It also doesn't depend on the current.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.210
This is basically the definition of an Olmec resistor.

01:46.520 --> 01:54.920
Which means if you were going to make a plot of voltage versus the current which you would get would

01:54.920 --> 01:57.140
be a straight line.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.290
That's what this equation tells me.

01:59.570 --> 02:01.210
And the slope of that line

02:04.850 --> 02:11.670
the slope would simply be equal to the resistance are so I'd double the voltage.

02:11.670 --> 02:20.370
I will get two times as much current If I have two resistors over here two different plots Magin this

02:20.370 --> 02:22.740
guy hears are two that has a different slope.

02:22.770 --> 02:26.760
The resistance here of R2 is bigger than the resistance.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.280
The red one are.

02:28.470 --> 02:31.060
Call it R1.

02:31.090 --> 02:33.460
OK so this really summarizes ohms law.

02:33.550 --> 02:38.050
If I want to make the resistance of any wire bigger I can do several things.

02:38.050 --> 02:41.350
I could change the resistivity I could make that longer.

02:41.440 --> 02:48.460
Or I can make the cross-sectional smaller if I want to bring down the overall resistance I reduce the

02:48.510 --> 02:52.690
resistivity I reduce the length or make the cross-section bigger.
