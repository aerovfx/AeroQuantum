00:00.190 --> 00:03.990
All right now time to discuss resistance and introduce Ohm's law.

00:04.140 --> 00:08.700
So resistance we're talking about resists the flow of electrons so resistance.

00:08.700 --> 00:12.460
Let's write that down to the flow of charge.

00:14.350 --> 00:17.220
Bigger the resistance the more it resists.

00:17.350 --> 00:23.320
It's harder for electrons to flow through that particular material or a taco conductors here.

00:23.320 --> 00:28.870
And we remember what we said about conductors well in order to get electrons moving the battery or whatever

00:28.870 --> 00:32.560
it is must set up an electric field in one direction.

00:32.800 --> 00:39.460
If you set up an electric field in that direction electrons are going to move opposite in some drif

00:39.550 --> 00:46.940
at some drif philosophy and the direction of the current is actually opposite of the electron flow and

00:46.940 --> 00:48.240
that's what we call the current.

00:48.270 --> 00:54.840
I all right now there is a relationship now between the electric field and the quantity we had called

00:54.840 --> 00:57.050
J Our current density.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.010
That's this.

00:58.020 --> 01:00.330
Remember all of these things this is current density

01:04.300 --> 01:05.270
right this down.

01:05.270 --> 01:12.770
And remember that was current I divided by the cross-sectional area of our particular wire.

01:13.050 --> 01:21.150
E was our electric field.

01:21.430 --> 01:21.700
All right.

01:21.710 --> 01:27.530
And the relationship between both of those is actually one form of Ohm's law which is maybe not the

01:27.530 --> 01:30.550
most common form but let me write it down anyway.

01:30.860 --> 01:35.690
Is that the electric field the bigger you make this electric field basically the more current You're

01:35.690 --> 01:36.130
going to get.

01:36.140 --> 01:42.230
But the relationship looks like this is that the magnitude of the electric field can be written as the

01:42.230 --> 01:47.320
resistivity will define this in a minute multiplied by the current density.

01:47.330 --> 01:54.200
It basically says that for many conductors that the electric field is proportional to the current density

01:54.650 --> 02:00.790
and the constant of proportionality is a property that depends on the material.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.990
And this is what we'd call the resistivity

02:05.750 --> 02:11.840
for example copper will have a reserve Stephenie silver will have a resistivity any conductor will have

02:11.840 --> 02:16.460
a particular resistivity any substance will have a resistivity.

02:16.460 --> 02:23.360
So that's what it says that the electric field is directly proportional to the current density.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.390
Now if I go on this side here and I substitute a couple of things let's get rid of current density and

02:29.390 --> 02:33.970
let's replace it by definition the total current divided by the total area.

02:34.280 --> 02:39.920
Let's see what this equation looks like says that the electric field is equal to my resists devotee

02:41.570 --> 02:46.700
multiplied by the total current multiplied by that cross-sectional area.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.650
OK so we're one step further.

02:48.650 --> 02:56.000
Now it says that my electric field is directly proportional to the current and the constant of proportionality

02:56.010 --> 02:59.530
in this case would be the resisting city divided by the area.

03:00.200 --> 03:00.440
All right.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.480
Now to produce an electric field let's assume that the electric field here is constant the way you produce

03:05.480 --> 03:13.310
an electric field like this is you might apply a voltage on one side and a voltage on the other side.

03:13.640 --> 03:17.990
You might apply a difference of voltage between the two sides.

03:18.320 --> 03:26.180
You might make this one some Plus voltage you might make this one a negative voltage and that will produce

03:26.180 --> 03:31.420
a potential difference right between the two points.

03:31.430 --> 03:36.110
So if I make the PSI a positive voltage make this side a negative voltage the field will point from

03:36.110 --> 03:43.520
the positive toward the negative and Delta V the difference of potential here is simply going to be

03:43.520 --> 03:47.530
the plus minus V minus.

03:47.780 --> 03:48.280
All right.

03:48.380 --> 03:50.950
And now this wire here has a particular length.

03:50.970 --> 03:59.670
I don't know what it is let's call it Al and let's assume that that field is fairly constant throughout

03:59.970 --> 04:01.530
that conductor.

04:01.530 --> 04:06.630
Actually the magnitude of the field is related to the potential difference the magnitude of the field

04:07.560 --> 04:14.000
is related to what is the voltage difference between the two sides divided by the length of the wire.

04:16.120 --> 04:22.990
Now if I go ahead now and I substitute that into my first equation equation 1 to call this equation

04:22.990 --> 04:28.780
to substitute this into my top equation which you end up getting here is that the potential difference

04:29.620 --> 04:38.230
divided by the length is equal to the resistivity the current and divided by the area.

04:38.250 --> 04:41.860
Now what I'm going to do on the left hand side here I'm just going to bring the length on the other

04:41.860 --> 04:48.970
side and what you get is delta V is equal to I'll open a bracket and then I'm going to have a current

04:48.970 --> 04:56.480
over here and determine the bracket Here's the resistivity the length and divided by the area.

04:57.370 --> 05:03.240
This equation over here this is also another form of Ohm's law.

05:03.380 --> 05:05.310
So we have one form over here.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.800
They're actually the exact same equation.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.950
They might not look like it but they really are the same.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.170
And let's link them together like this.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.260
OK.

05:14.520 --> 05:22.380
Now the quantity and the bracket this is how we define the resistance of material the resistance of

05:22.380 --> 05:26.660
a material can simply be written as the reason Stephenie.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.480
That's a property of the material multiplied by these other two factors the length and divided by the

05:33.480 --> 05:34.640
area.

05:34.680 --> 05:40.020
So we have a property of the material here for the resistivity and then you have another term the length

05:40.020 --> 05:46.680
divided by the area which is basically only associated to the geometry of that particular conductor

05:46.680 --> 05:49.190
of that material.

05:49.800 --> 05:56.010
Now this other term over here Delta V A lot of times you can simplify that a lot of times people drop

05:56.010 --> 05:59.070
the Delta and they simply write Ohm's law.

05:59.070 --> 06:01.910
Let me make some more space over here.

06:02.560 --> 06:03.570
Let's delete this.

06:03.570 --> 06:04.600
We know it's a conductor.

06:04.620 --> 06:05.940
Let's get rid of that.

06:06.030 --> 06:11.990
Now a lot of times what happens is instead of writing Delta V the simply write the letter V.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.730
However it's always really meant that it's always a difference of potential between two points or between

06:17.730 --> 06:20.310
two surfaces down.

06:20.370 --> 06:28.180
That equals to the Terman the bracket is the resistance and then we're left with the current.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.510
This here is really the more classic definition of Ohm's law.

06:36.120 --> 06:41.940
So let's make that very very important equation for conductors.

06:42.030 --> 06:49.170
It tells you that the amount of current that you get is directly proportional to the potential difference

06:49.170 --> 06:53.250
that you apply between the ends of the conductor.

06:53.250 --> 06:58.500
In other words it tells you that the magnitude of the electric field or the magnitude of the current

06:58.500 --> 07:03.900
that you're going to get basically is linearly dependent with the magnitude of the electric fuel that

07:03.900 --> 07:05.490
you produce.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.990
So these equations are really the same equation.

07:09.090 --> 07:12.810
They're just kind of slightly written differently.

07:13.380 --> 07:16.920
And again this is the approach to link one equation to the other.

07:17.280 --> 07:23.310
Often you drop the delta but it's always V is a voltage but it's really a voltage difference between

07:23.310 --> 07:24.830
two ends.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.510
Sometimes you call this a potential difference.

07:27.690 --> 07:31.200
The resistance remember is given down here by my simple equation.

07:31.410 --> 07:34.200
It depends on the resistance hero.

07:34.860 --> 07:37.020
It depends on the length of the wire.

07:37.020 --> 07:39.570
The longer you make it the more resistance there is.

07:39.570 --> 07:41.730
That makes sense.

07:41.730 --> 07:43.670
Think about this other term the area.

07:43.890 --> 07:47.820
Why would the resistance go down if I make the area big.

07:47.840 --> 07:53.610
Imagine I have a really big cross-section where the resistance goes down because there's more paths

07:53.940 --> 07:57.000
for that electron to take as it travels through the wire.

07:59.140 --> 08:02.300
If the area is small the resistance tends to be big.

08:02.600 --> 08:07.360
All right the resistance is big because there's only one kind of path for that electron to take as it

08:07.360 --> 08:09.560
flows through this wire.
