00:00.150 --> 00:02.540
OK and I want to look at that discharging a capacitor.

00:02.540 --> 00:07.350
So in this case here we're going to start off with a capacity that initially even charged up.

00:07.350 --> 00:10.980
So we have some amount of charge let's call it zero.

00:11.520 --> 00:15.420
And then at time equals to zero what we're going to do is we're going to close the switch right now

00:15.420 --> 00:19.200
if the switch is oping the charge is simply going to stay there really has nowhere to go.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.810
This is a path of infinite resistance.

00:21.810 --> 00:24.000
So there's no current that can flow.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.860
All right but we're going to do now we're going to close this switch if I close the switch you're going

00:28.860 --> 00:34.230
to create a connection in here and as soon as you close that switch Well what's going to happen if you

00:34.230 --> 00:40.740
have positive charge over here again you're going to have a positive current that's going to flow in

00:40.740 --> 00:42.930
this direction right here.

00:43.930 --> 00:44.280
OK.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.540
And that's the positive current.

00:45.660 --> 00:48.380
So now our goal is similar to what it was before.

00:48.390 --> 00:53.170
What we want to do is we want to find how much charge there is as a function of time on this capacitor.

00:53.460 --> 00:58.890
What is the voltage between the plates of the capacitor as a function of time and also what is the current

00:58.890 --> 01:00.840
that current is not going to last forever.

01:00.850 --> 01:05.170
Last for a certain amount of time and it will decay to zero at some point.

01:05.170 --> 01:08.820
All right well it can only last as long as there is charge on the capacitor.

01:08.820 --> 01:15.270
So in order to solve this problem let's do apply Kirchhoff's loop rule to this problem.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.000
We can start over here.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.190
Let's start here a point A and let's go around and do a counterclockwise loop.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.410
So if we have current flowing in this direction that means we're going to have the voltage drop across

01:28.410 --> 01:34.890
that resistor and then voltage drop is given by minus IIR same as before.

01:35.450 --> 01:41.240
So again now we're going across a capacitor we go from the negative to the positive so we have plus

01:41.240 --> 01:50.510
the voltage across the capacitor and I go back to point A that there must be equal to zero.

01:50.510 --> 01:54.530
Now again we're going to use our capacitor equation if you remember the capacitor equation that relates

01:54.530 --> 01:58.350
the amount of charge on the plates to the capacitance.

01:58.530 --> 02:03.000
And we're going to use that just to eliminate the voltage across the capacitor over here.

02:03.770 --> 02:10.430
So let's do this one extra step and so we still get mine as I are and now plus instead of VC I replace

02:10.430 --> 02:16.010
that with Q divided by the capacitance and that's equal to zero.

02:16.010 --> 02:21.040
Now this equation looks similar to the previous one but there's a couple of important differences there

02:21.050 --> 02:25.320
in order to solve it here or we're going to do is going to do one more step.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.770
So let's look at this equation for a minute.

02:27.770 --> 02:34.960
This is really related to what's going on with their capacitor and this guy here is really what's going

02:34.960 --> 02:36.460
on with the resistor.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.300
Now what I want to do is I want to relate this current.

02:42.990 --> 02:43.710
Right.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.630
You have to be a little bit careful when you ride out the current here for the discharging case.

02:47.750 --> 02:48.710
I'm going to just ride it out.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.160
And let's talk about it for a minute.

02:50.180 --> 02:54.980
What I'm going to do is I'm going to replace it by you know current is the rate of change of charge

02:54.980 --> 02:56.150
divided by time.

02:56.330 --> 03:05.960
But if I want to relate what's going on with the resistor to what's going on with the capacitor and

03:05.960 --> 03:08.580
again is the charge on the capacitor right.

03:11.110 --> 03:11.580
OK.

03:11.730 --> 03:16.890
Now the reason I'm including a negative sign here the negative sign is just to indicate that the charge

03:16.920 --> 03:23.100
is reducing right charge on the capacitor is getting smaller That's why you have a negative slope over

03:23.100 --> 03:23.820
here.

03:23.820 --> 03:30.390
We have a negative rate that will ensure that although we have a positive current going in this direction

03:31.770 --> 03:34.450
we have to have that the charge on the plates.

03:34.530 --> 03:40.190
Again those charges are going to reduce as a function of time and this negative sign ensures that.

03:40.340 --> 03:44.310
So charges on capacitor

03:48.830 --> 03:53.650
reduce will eventually get more spacing between the charges.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.600
Eventually the charges go to zero.

03:55.610 --> 04:00.710
So this is going to be an important step over here and we're going to substitute this expression in

04:00.710 --> 04:02.640
the Kirchoff's voltage law.

04:02.660 --> 04:07.130
So again it's simply the connection because we want to write an equation that's completely for the capacitor

04:07.130 --> 04:08.490
in order to solve it.

04:09.050 --> 04:17.330
OK so if I plug in the negative sign what you end up getting over here is the Q Were ditty and negative

04:17.330 --> 04:20.810
sign will cancel with the other one you're still left with the resistance.

04:20.810 --> 04:23.160
Let me just put that in the front plus.

04:23.220 --> 04:26.700
Q Over C equals zero.

04:26.910 --> 04:34.240
And the last step here what I'm going to do is just rewrite it just so it's a slightly different form.

04:34.670 --> 04:38.900
So I have dequeue over D.T. on one side.

04:38.900 --> 04:46.580
Now if I do that again I've divided through by the resistance and what you're going to have on this

04:46.580 --> 04:50.530
side is mine is q over RC.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.060
All right.

04:51.080 --> 04:57.440
This is really the differential equation that you want to solve for you go to the previous case the

04:57.440 --> 05:00.300
way we did it is first we did a change of variable.

05:00.410 --> 05:01.880
Then I brought the Kule on this side.

05:01.880 --> 05:07.370
I brought the to that side and you could do it that way you'll be able to solve it using the exact same

05:07.370 --> 05:09.540
technique we did for the charging case.

05:09.680 --> 05:15.170
In this case here I'm just going to write out the solution and what you can do is you can substitute

05:15.170 --> 05:19.970
this solution into the equation here in the red box and check it out that it actually is a solution.

05:20.180 --> 05:24.520
So you substitute it on the left hand side you substitute on the right hand side and you're going to

05:24.510 --> 05:26.730
easily show that they're equal to each other.

05:27.140 --> 05:33.230
So the charge is a function of time on the capacitor is equal to some initial charge and then this term

05:33.230 --> 05:37.890
here is going to look very familiar to you if you understood the charging case.

05:38.150 --> 05:43.430
We have minus T divided by this RC time constant.

05:43.490 --> 05:43.750
All right.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.200
So this is the solution.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.740
This is our solution for

05:52.320 --> 05:58.300
yeah this is the solution for the charge as a function of time on the capacitor plates.

05:58.380 --> 06:03.540
The nice thing about it is if you know the charges is a function of time we go back to our capacitor

06:03.540 --> 06:10.220
equation we automatically know the voltage across the capacitor as a function of time.

06:10.310 --> 06:17.490
Right because all we need to do in order to get the voltage is simply divide the charge by the capacitance.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.290
We can go ahead and do that.

06:19.290 --> 06:27.910
So we across the capacitor is a function of time is simply equal to Q 0 divided by C.

06:27.990 --> 06:36.620
And at the same time dependency minus T over R C.

06:36.890 --> 06:39.230
Now we've gotten quite a bit done.

06:39.250 --> 06:44.560
We all we need to do now is look at the current as a function of time and then let's maybe sketch some

06:44.560 --> 06:48.640
of those functions just so we could see what they look like four different time constants.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.070
OK so what's next.

06:50.080 --> 06:55.150
Well let's compare now the charge is a function of time and here I'm just going to plot the charge because

06:55.150 --> 06:58.950
I the voltage has the exact same time dependence.

06:59.020 --> 07:05.530
So if you plot Q As a function of t so plot time down here and Q is a function of time.

07:05.830 --> 07:11.410
What you do is you start off here at some initial value that time equals zero you substitute zero and

07:11.410 --> 07:12.640
here you Simpson.

07:12.710 --> 07:14.420
You simply get Q zero.

07:14.830 --> 07:15.100
All right.

07:15.110 --> 07:20.020
Now let's pick a blue color an exponential function like this.

07:20.020 --> 07:24.520
This is an exponentially decaying function simply kind of looks like this.

07:24.520 --> 07:28.350
It approaches zero as time gets very very big.

07:29.170 --> 07:34.890
So let's call this for our time constant which is simply our time.

07:34.900 --> 07:42.040
See now what if you are going to compare this case to maybe a red one and I'll make the red one kind

07:42.040 --> 07:46.240
of decay faster.

07:46.310 --> 07:50.370
So this one here would mean it would have the same initial cube zero.

07:50.420 --> 07:53.310
However it would have a different time constant.

07:53.930 --> 07:58.890
So what can we conclude about the red one versus the blue one.

07:58.970 --> 08:06.510
Which one here has the bigger time constant if you compare the red one to the blue one.

08:06.580 --> 08:13.950
And again if something here has a small time constant if the time constant is small it means that either

08:13.950 --> 08:21.270
the resistance is small or the capacitance is small so if the resistance is small it means that well

08:21.270 --> 08:24.470
that current or or the chart is a function of time.

08:24.750 --> 08:29.880
It's going to leave very very fast there is no resistance for it to leave.

08:30.180 --> 08:33.170
So it's going to go to zero very very fast.

08:33.180 --> 08:39.090
So in this case here the time constant for the red case would be something that is smaller than the

08:39.090 --> 08:39.950
blue one.

08:40.230 --> 08:47.750
If something has a long RC time constant it tends to decay very very slowly.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.950
Now how do you get the current Well the current.

08:49.950 --> 08:53.190
Remember the definition or the current.

08:53.190 --> 08:56.150
Again now we're simply going to take the rate of change.

08:56.160 --> 08:56.400
All right.

08:56.400 --> 09:02.140
That's the derivative of dequeue.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.330
Now if you want to include the negative sign you can hear we know the direction of the current.

09:08.340 --> 09:13.260
Now this here represents the charge on the plates the way we have it written here.

09:13.260 --> 09:15.640
So just be a little bit careful here.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.720
There could be a negative sign that lingers here.

09:17.730 --> 09:24.030
But again if you look at this plot over here the way I have it written here is the current He represents

09:24.150 --> 09:28.350
how the charge on the plates change as a function of time because then we're leading into the charge

09:28.350 --> 09:34.980
on the capacitor the negative sign and the positive sign for the current simply tell me the direction.

09:34.980 --> 09:40.850
So if you take a derivative of an exponential with respect to time you get X and you get the same term

09:40.860 --> 09:41.400
right.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.930
The only thing you have to worry about is that this factor here is going to come out and you're going

09:45.930 --> 09:46.770
to get something like this.

09:46.770 --> 09:55.540
So the constant is going to remain the same the next term I'm going to get is minus 1 over R C and now

09:55.540 --> 10:00.370
you get exponential of the exact same term.

10:00.410 --> 10:05.550
So the shape if I plot a graph of current as a function of time it's going to look the exact same.

10:06.320 --> 10:06.830
Let's have a look.

10:06.830 --> 10:14.750
Now this is kind of clean this up here so you get minus Q zero divided by R C an exponential of minus

10:14.750 --> 10:21.460
T over R C and that is our current as a function of time.

10:21.620 --> 10:23.520
Can Go ahead and make a sketch of that.

10:23.750 --> 10:26.910
It's going to look exactly the same way.

10:27.200 --> 10:34.880
The number on the front here this number here in the box is here represents the initial current that

10:34.880 --> 10:37.870
we're going to find all right at initial current.

10:38.030 --> 10:43.430
And that makes sense because let's go have let's go ahead and look at this so you read it out.

10:43.430 --> 10:44.980
The initial current that you get from

10:50.730 --> 10:55.920
if you remember the Kirchoff's voltage law for this circuit is very very simple right.

10:55.920 --> 11:05.550
We had minus i r plus the voltage across the capacitor I use the capacitor equation to simplify this

11:05.560 --> 11:11.200
term but we know that this initial current at least the magnitude of it here should be equal to Visi

11:11.680 --> 11:12.890
divided by R.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.950
And that's what you get for this equation.

11:14.950 --> 11:19.840
The voltage across the capacitor here is q zero divided by C..

11:20.050 --> 11:20.440
All right.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.040
Now we can again make a plot of this.

11:23.260 --> 11:28.300
We'll have the exact same kind of time dependence over here except the only difference is here we're

11:28.420 --> 11:36.220
plotting current So current is a function of time versus time and again if it's something with a long

11:36.220 --> 11:42.630
time constant again it takes a while for that curve to decay to zero.

11:42.670 --> 11:48.010
At this point here the current is effectively tends towards zero at this point here the initial current

11:48.010 --> 11:54.580
is depends on how much charge I initially had and depends on that time constant at this initial current

11:54.580 --> 11:55.440
over here.

11:55.870 --> 12:02.000
You can compare that to the Red K something that decays faster to zero and it's the exact same form.

12:02.650 --> 12:05.710
OK so the discharging case is pretty straightforward.

12:06.280 --> 12:10.280
We've looked at voltage charging current.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.000
That's it folks is nothing else to.
