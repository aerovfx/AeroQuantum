00:00.150 --> 00:05.100
A couple of things that I want to also mention about both of these charging and discharging cases here.

00:05.400 --> 00:08.670
So in the charging case again we're putting charges on these plates.

00:08.730 --> 00:13.320
Basically what we're doing is we're creating an electric field here and whenever you create an electric

00:13.320 --> 00:17.030
field you end up storing energy.

00:17.130 --> 00:18.170
So think about that.

00:18.180 --> 00:24.000
So we end up storing energy here in that electric field or the capacitor stores energy.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.090
There's all kind of different ways of looking at the exact same problem in the other case.

00:29.220 --> 00:34.680
What we have is we initially have some energy stored in our capacitor and then that energy once you

00:34.680 --> 00:36.880
start having that current flowing.

00:37.320 --> 00:41.550
When I close a switch Well that energy gets dissipated in this resistor.

00:41.610 --> 00:45.570
So if you wanted to look at this are these problems from an energy perspective here.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.240
It's kind of different ways you can look at it.

00:47.250 --> 00:51.650
But if I could I can always write the energy stored in a capacitor.

00:51.690 --> 00:56.460
The different ways of doing this here let me just to kind of this way here is one half multiplied by

00:56.460 --> 01:02.070
the charge on the capacitor multiplied by the voltage across the capacitor.

01:02.070 --> 01:08.850
Now if I use my capacitor equation remember here we had the charge was always proportional to the voltage

01:08.850 --> 01:10.390
across the plates.

01:10.530 --> 01:15.240
So there's different ways of writing this formula if you either want to eliminate the charge I can using

01:15.240 --> 01:21.990
this equation so you can write this as one half C-v square depending on what kind of information you

01:21.990 --> 01:25.640
know and if you don't know the voltage across the capacitor.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.820
But you know the charge and the capacitance You can also write it like this.

01:28.830 --> 01:34.960
So just to eliminate voltage from this expression using a simple equation here you get one half Q square

01:34.960 --> 01:40.650
to receive the exact same expression just written in three different forms so make sure you remember

01:40.650 --> 01:42.020
that guy.

01:42.210 --> 01:48.900
Now everything that we've seen so far for example we've seen that in this case over here let's just

01:48.900 --> 01:53.910
take this one or even and this one we've seen that in both cases we were able to calculate that these

01:53.910 --> 01:56.640
were time dependent quantities right.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.750
These were.

01:58.230 --> 02:02.730
We had functions that describe them and we can calculate the voltage at any time.

02:02.760 --> 02:07.260
So our expression is now for the potential energy stored as a function of time.

02:07.290 --> 02:10.020
They also become time dependent equations.

02:10.110 --> 02:10.730
Right.

02:10.770 --> 02:18.180
So in reality when you're writing them down now for RC circuits all of these quantities here become

02:18.180 --> 02:19.930
time dependent quantities.

02:20.220 --> 02:23.160
So you can get this in and get another expression here.

02:23.190 --> 02:28.650
If I substitute depending on which case I'm looking at the charging vs. versus discharging you can get

02:28.650 --> 02:32.960
an expression of the potential energy stored in that capacitor as a function of time.

02:33.210 --> 02:40.610
And again I can use either of the other equations as well but just keep in mind this here becomes a

02:40.920 --> 02:43.020
time dependent quantity.

02:43.050 --> 02:47.580
The other thing we looked at before when we looked at circuits was power.

02:47.570 --> 02:55.620
All right power was the rate at which either energy was being dissipated or the rate at which energy

02:55.620 --> 02:58.100
was being supplied to the circuit.

02:58.410 --> 03:05.550
So for power what we had we also had different expressions like power being delivered to the circuit

03:05.640 --> 03:09.840
was the IMF multiplied by the current.

03:09.840 --> 03:19.600
Now this becomes a time dependent equation because our current changes with time so keep that in mind

03:20.220 --> 03:25.810
whenever you are solving problems for RC circuits and then looking at the power we have to use our expressions.

03:25.810 --> 03:31.900
Now we might look at power in the short time versus the long time limit then we're just taking specific

03:31.900 --> 03:34.060
cases here for this function.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.710
But otherwise you're going to be a little bit careful.

03:35.710 --> 03:41.320
Also if you're looking at the power being dissipated in the resistance again our expression expressions

03:41.320 --> 03:51.330
before our eyes squared was one which was also equal to the squared over our again.

03:51.340 --> 03:55.690
All of these now would become time dependent equations.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.980
So all of those exponential factors I want to say one more thing.

03:59.980 --> 04:04.360
All of these exponential factors that we had for our time dependent equations.

04:04.360 --> 04:06.520
They all look something like this.

04:08.570 --> 04:13.820
When you square all those terms that's what's going to happen here and all of these expressions we're

04:13.820 --> 04:16.460
going to end up squaring all those terms.

04:16.460 --> 04:22.430
So they all become when you square an exponential you're not going to change the sign but you're going

04:22.430 --> 04:25.270
to get a two in the front.

04:25.820 --> 04:31.100
Exponential of minus T divided by R C squared.

04:31.220 --> 04:35.920
Member the laws of the exponents here you end up getting a minus two.

04:35.930 --> 04:38.510
They're all right I let you practice that.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.950
I think I've got a couple of problem and the problems that that look at.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.200
Energy and Power.

04:42.220 --> 04:47.800
So it will look more specifically at problems but I just wanted to highlight this that.

04:48.250 --> 04:48.800
OK.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.580
It's the same expressions as what you previously used in static cases.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.060
Just now we have to use the time dependent expressions.
