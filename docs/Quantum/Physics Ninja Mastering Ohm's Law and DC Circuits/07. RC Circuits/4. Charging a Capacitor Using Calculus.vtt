00:00.270 --> 00:06.600
OK in order to actually get a an equation for the charging current as a function of time now we're going

00:06.600 --> 00:09.410
to have to do is use a bit of calculus.

00:10.170 --> 00:15.540
So I want to start with the expression I had for the current before I took any of those limits the short

00:15.540 --> 00:17.340
time and the long time limit.

00:17.610 --> 00:21.660
And again this is just the result of Kirchoff's voltage law.

00:22.290 --> 00:28.290
So from this equation here I have a current that relates is directly related to the charge and I know

00:28.290 --> 00:29.160
both of these change.

00:29.160 --> 00:31.080
Everything else is a constant here.

00:31.080 --> 00:34.670
BMF is a constant capacitance is a constant.

00:34.980 --> 00:40.690
The resistance is a constant but I know that I and Q They are functions of time.

00:40.690 --> 00:46.590
So one thing I'm going to do is let's start by substituting in the definition of the current the current

00:46.590 --> 00:52.500
by definition is the rate of change of the charge with respect to time.

00:52.590 --> 00:53.690
OK.

00:53.920 --> 00:59.530
And now all I'm going to do here is I'm just going to just factor out the terms what I want to get is

00:59.530 --> 01:04.810
kind of a term would charge by itself so I'm going to factor out this one over R C that's the term in

01:04.930 --> 01:05.820
front of the charge.

01:05.820 --> 01:12.030
Q Let's open up the bracket and what you're left with now is Q And the next term.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.110
You've got to be a little bit careful here when you write this out.

01:14.140 --> 01:21.670
Well you should get minus the capacitance multiplied by the ESF of the battery and you see if you multiply

01:21.670 --> 01:24.910
that through the capacitances are going to cancel out for the second terms.

01:25.090 --> 01:29.750
This negative sign will take care of that one and you'll be left with this term here.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.120
All right.

01:31.240 --> 01:36.760
Now in order to get an equation what we're going to have to do at some point is integrate but before

01:36.760 --> 01:41.800
integrating I got to put all the terms with the charge on one side and all the terms with the time on

01:41.800 --> 01:42.970
the other side.

01:43.470 --> 01:50.860
OK so if I put all the terms of the charge on one side it looks something like this says dequeue divided

01:50.860 --> 01:51.460
by.

01:51.580 --> 01:56.180
Now the term in the bracket over here can bring that in the denominator on the other side.

01:56.230 --> 02:03.300
So this is simply Q minus the capacitance multiplied by the MF.

02:03.310 --> 02:13.920
Now this here must be equal to minus 1 over R C and multiplied by the.

02:13.960 --> 02:18.310
OK so now what we're going to do here is I'm just going to do a change of variable because at the end

02:18.310 --> 02:24.920
I want my final answer to be q and T so I can have those integration variables.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.610
I'm just going to call these prime values here.

02:27.910 --> 02:32.320
Just a simple change a variable and now what you're going to do now is we're going to integrate both

02:32.320 --> 02:33.800
sides.

02:34.030 --> 02:38.570
I'm going to integrate the charges and the charges we know they initially were at zero.

02:38.590 --> 02:43.210
So they go from zero to some final value.

02:43.210 --> 02:50.900
Q And the time I integrate this side from 0 all the way to some final time t.

02:51.140 --> 02:53.430
This is why I require the change variable here.

02:54.790 --> 02:58.650
OK so to integrate this side you may have to remember if you don't remember.

02:58.730 --> 02:59.960
OK.

03:01.240 --> 03:08.730
It's the natural log it's the natural log of Q Prime minus C.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.670
And don't forget we're going to have to substitute our limits here.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.480
Q And 0.

03:14.650 --> 03:16.260
The other side is a lot easier.

03:16.390 --> 03:18.490
It's simply minus T

03:22.830 --> 03:31.100
minus T prime rather sore divided by R C and again the integration limits here are simply T and 0.

03:33.030 --> 03:35.870
All right so now what you have to do is simply substitute.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.430
OK.

03:37.470 --> 03:42.420
After you substitute Let's go ahead and do that over on this side.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.060
So if you substitute Q In Here.

03:44.210 --> 03:44.910
That's easy.

03:44.910 --> 03:46.770
It looks exactly the same.

03:46.770 --> 03:50.280
And don't forget you're going to be taking the difference between these integration limits.

03:50.370 --> 03:54.870
When you substitute the zero here what I'm going to do is I'm just going to write it I'm going to use

03:54.870 --> 04:00.630
properties of the logarithm function remember taking the difference between two logarithms is the same

04:00.630 --> 04:02.800
thing as dividing the argument here.

04:03.080 --> 04:14.380
So actually you can write this term as that minus C and divided by minus C write this is the term with

04:14.390 --> 04:20.900
zero substituted in here and rather than writing natural law of some term minus natural law or the other

04:20.900 --> 04:31.550
term I use the fact that natural law of a mine is be natural log of B is equal to natural law of a Overby

04:31.630 --> 04:31.790
right.

04:31.790 --> 04:36.680
That's one of the properties of the natural log function.

04:36.710 --> 04:44.350
All right the right hand side now simply becomes minus T over R C.

04:44.360 --> 04:44.600
All right.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.880
I'm almost done now.

04:45.950 --> 04:50.540
Really what I want to do is I want to get an equation of q as a function of time.

04:50.660 --> 04:56.160
So I have to get rid of this natural log in the way you do that is you take an exponential on both sides.

04:56.300 --> 05:06.340
So if you take an exponential on both sides this term here is simply going to become Q minus C divided

05:06.340 --> 05:16.940
by minus C Well let's just switch the order here and this here becomes exponential of minus T divided

05:16.940 --> 05:18.950
by R C.

05:19.010 --> 05:19.910
All right.

05:19.910 --> 05:20.770
And now the last bit.

05:20.780 --> 05:28.640
All you have to do is kind of isolate we'll do that over here in Kunaal actually explicitly say q is

05:28.640 --> 05:33.710
now is a function of time as you can see and this term here simply becomes.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.560
Do a little bit of math you may have to add an extra step here if you don't see it quite as quickly

05:39.560 --> 05:40.330
as I do.

05:40.820 --> 05:48.950
But it looks like this one minus exponential minus T divided by R C

05:52.050 --> 05:54.220
and here's the final expression I have.

05:54.300 --> 06:00.090
And remember this term here in the front there's a term in front that's what we had found in the previous

06:00.090 --> 06:01.110
case.

06:01.170 --> 06:04.080
This here is really what the final charge was.

06:04.380 --> 06:11.800
It was our final charge in the long time limit was equal to the capacitance multiplied by the IMF.

06:11.860 --> 06:17.340
And now we have this other bracket here and this other function of time 1 minus exponential of this

06:17.550 --> 06:19.990
decaying function here.

06:20.280 --> 06:27.330
So let's have a closer look at the mathematics involved in terms of this equation and use it to calculate

06:27.330 --> 06:28.100
what the current is.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.150
Now as a function of time.
