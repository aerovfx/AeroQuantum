00:00.330 --> 00:06.510
OK I now want to just compare the previous case now to spend a little bit more time on a long time limit.

00:06.720 --> 00:12.600
So the switch has been closed now for a longer period of time so my current We said DKs because of the

00:12.600 --> 00:18.210
build up of charge and the field produced by the capacitor inside the wire offsets the electric fuel

00:18.210 --> 00:22.890
produced by the battery inside the wire.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.400
All right.

00:23.400 --> 00:29.750
So we're down over here we know the current eventually gets to zero current eventually gets to zero.

00:29.880 --> 00:32.590
I've placed a maximum amount of charge here.

00:32.700 --> 00:37.070
Let's call a final charge on this capacitor QF.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.360
So there's plus QF on one charge on one plate.

00:40.470 --> 00:44.000
There is negative QF on the other plate.

00:44.390 --> 00:47.910
And let's go back to my loop rule.

00:47.930 --> 00:50.970
What would the Luper look like now in the long time limit.

00:51.020 --> 00:52.970
That was my equation 1.

00:53.030 --> 01:00.960
So in the long time limit Well let's rewrite it except this time I no longer have to worry about the

01:00.960 --> 01:07.530
current term because I remember I just said that the current goes to zero when the current goes to zero

01:07.530 --> 01:08.790
after a long time.

01:08.820 --> 01:16.820
It means there is no more voltage drop across this resistor so we can eliminate this term in the long

01:16.820 --> 01:21.340
time limit and that means we're immediately left with that the voltage.

01:21.770 --> 01:23.470
There's only two terms left here.

01:23.720 --> 01:31.490
You see that the voltage across the capacitor ends up being equal to the EMR for the battery and that

01:31.490 --> 01:36.620
is kind of this point over here that's when equilibrium is kind of set.

01:36.620 --> 01:44.060
Now if I use my capacitor equation Well the capacitor equation I know that the voltage across the capacitor

01:44.060 --> 01:51.520
is equal to and this time limit it's going to be the final charge divided by the capacitance which equals

01:51.520 --> 01:54.170
to the E-Myth of the battery.

01:54.880 --> 02:01.660
So lastly I just want to isolate for what the final charges the final charge on those plates is actually

02:01.660 --> 02:07.640
simply equal to the capacitance multiplied by the EMR of the battery.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.850
This is an important equation right here.

02:11.810 --> 02:19.150
One thing that we notice here is that it doesn't depend on our let's write that down.

02:19.280 --> 02:28.120
So regardless of what the resistances the final charge you get on the plates is independent of our does

02:28.120 --> 02:32.040
not depend on the value of the resistance.

02:32.060 --> 02:34.390
That's kind of interesting.

02:34.440 --> 02:40.810
Now if to this plot I'm going to add now what the charge looks like I'm going to plot it on the same

02:40.810 --> 02:44.080
y axis except the green line will represent the charge.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.490
The blackline will represent the current as I have it here.

02:47.890 --> 02:51.520
So initially what we had here is zero charge.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.210
So the charge actually started like this.

02:54.210 --> 02:59.680
And now we know that after a long period of time I'm going to reach some final value in the way it kind

02:59.680 --> 03:00.870
of does that.

03:00.880 --> 03:11.490
It looks like a opposite of an exponential decay like an exponentially kind of saturated value and this

03:11.490 --> 03:21.440
value here is simply QF which is equal to the capacitance multiplied by the EMI.

03:21.460 --> 03:26.170
OK so that's kind of just a qualitative look at what's going on in the short and the long time limit

03:27.060 --> 03:29.950
what we're going to do now is we're going to actually derive values.

03:29.950 --> 03:35.470
Now we're going to do a bit of calculus in the next video if you want to skip the calculus you can but

03:36.520 --> 03:37.760
it's not that bad.

03:38.080 --> 03:42.340
So we're going to actually look at these relationships and calculated the other thing you can see from

03:42.340 --> 03:43.930
both of these plots.

03:43.960 --> 03:51.770
Remember the connection here between the current and the charge the definition of the current tells

03:51.770 --> 03:55.670
you how does the charge change instantaneously right.

03:55.880 --> 04:02.000
It's the slope of the graph and that also makes sense from this plot.

04:02.270 --> 04:04.880
Let me plot the slope here in purple.

04:05.390 --> 04:10.630
If you look at the slope of the Green Line Well initially the slope is something like this.

04:10.790 --> 04:11.760
Right.

04:11.810 --> 04:16.250
It's large and it's positive and that's exactly what the current says right here.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.330
And then what happens to the slope.

04:18.350 --> 04:22.560
It still remains positive but it's not as steep.

04:22.640 --> 04:29.110
And once you get out over here it's not the best picture of the slope here but the slope tends towards

04:29.110 --> 04:34.860
zero once you get into the very long time limit because my current tends towards zero.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.230
OK so these pictures here are complimentary to one another.

04:38.300 --> 04:43.740
Recalling that my current is the instantaneous change of the charge with respect to time.
