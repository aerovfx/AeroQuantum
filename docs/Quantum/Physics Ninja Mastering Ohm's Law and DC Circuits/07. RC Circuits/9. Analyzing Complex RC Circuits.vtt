00:00.570 --> 00:07.430
All right and what we did before we had our AC circuits however we only had one resistor and one capacitor

00:07.440 --> 00:09.280
so is pretty straight forward.

00:09.300 --> 00:14.400
I now want to look at what happens if we have more complicated RC circuits but we're not going to do

00:14.400 --> 00:17.100
all of the differential equations in the calculus.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.700
Well we're going to do is we're going to analyze two time limits.

00:20.760 --> 00:25.210
We're going to analyze the behavior of the current in the short time limit.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.610
So that's immediately after you close the switch just after you close the switch what happens.

00:29.610 --> 00:30.410
What is the current.

00:30.410 --> 00:35.460
For example in this circuit and also what happens after a long time.

00:35.690 --> 00:35.930
OK.

00:35.930 --> 00:41.900
We saw in our charging and discharging cases after a long time the current goes to zero for example.

00:42.120 --> 00:46.850
But again we only had one resistor and one capacitor what happens if we have something more complicated.

00:47.130 --> 00:53.240
So I've illustrated just one more complicated one more complicated circuit here on the left hand side.

00:53.250 --> 00:59.970
So here I have two resistors and I also have a capacitor here that is in parallel with the 8 ohm resistor

01:00.360 --> 01:02.560
that's connected to a power supply.

01:02.580 --> 01:07.710
So now you can ask yourself where I'm going to close the switch and I want to look at what happens in

01:07.710 --> 01:09.630
both of these time limits.

01:09.630 --> 01:13.650
So the top figure here represents the short time limit.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.270
I'll explain in just a minute.

01:15.780 --> 01:20.310
And the long time limit will be this bottom one.

01:21.390 --> 01:22.000
OK.

01:22.350 --> 01:28.950
So when we're tackling problems like this if you remember the charging case previously in that short

01:28.950 --> 01:32.500
time limit we actually had a lot of current initially.

01:32.610 --> 01:38.430
And the reason you have a lot of current is the capacitor in the short time limit basically behaves

01:38.430 --> 01:39.630
as though it's not there.

01:39.630 --> 01:42.130
It's as though there's a wire connected here.

01:42.180 --> 01:47.550
So the way we represent that on a circuit diagram in a short time limit what I would do I would suggest

01:47.550 --> 01:54.080
is you redraw the exact same circuit except wherever there is a capacitor you simply shorted out.

01:54.090 --> 02:00.120
You don't have to even draw the capacitor but you do have to draw the wire that connects the two points

02:00.120 --> 02:01.940
where the capacitor was located.

02:02.250 --> 02:08.610
So you see here between nodes seen I had a capacitor of six micro Feraud and now I simply connect that

02:08.610 --> 02:13.130
with a wire with basically no resistance.

02:14.040 --> 02:18.750
In the long time limit however what you end up doing here because in the long time limit remember what

02:18.750 --> 02:21.760
happens are capacitors become fully charged.

02:22.050 --> 02:28.170
In this case and that means when they become fully charge there's not going to be any more current flowing

02:28.170 --> 02:30.780
in branches where there is a capacitor.

02:30.900 --> 02:36.660
The way we represent that in circuit diagrams if we don't want any more current flowing in long time

02:36.660 --> 02:42.200
limit what you do is you simply produce a break in that in that part of the wire.

02:42.330 --> 02:46.060
So don't include the capacitor and just basically disconnected.

02:46.560 --> 02:52.200
When we do something like this is basically means that the resistance here of this guy here is very

02:52.200 --> 02:53.040
very big.

02:53.190 --> 02:59.310
So there will not be any current now flowing between points Siham point D here there's going to be a

02:59.310 --> 03:00.270
lot of current.

03:00.540 --> 03:02.430
But here there's not going to be any good.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.740
So whenever you're dealing with short and time limits short and long time limits this is how he suggests.

03:07.740 --> 03:10.140
So now let's do the analysis for each one of these cases.

03:10.140 --> 03:12.680
So how much current is there in each branch.

03:12.900 --> 03:18.240
Well you would apply Kirchoff's laws again in this case here I'm going to limit my math a little bit.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.980
I want to first what happened so I imagine here we're going to initially have some current Let's give

03:22.980 --> 03:29.700
it a color here current is going to flow away from the positive toward the negative.

03:29.700 --> 03:36.420
Now what happens when this current which flows through this forum resistor reaches the junction where

03:36.420 --> 03:37.640
is it going to go.

03:38.040 --> 03:43.080
Well is it going to go through the 8 ohm resistor or is it going to go through the path where there

03:43.080 --> 03:44.930
is no resistance.

03:44.930 --> 03:45.760
All right.

03:46.240 --> 03:50.220
And although you have to be a little bit careful here if you try to simplify this and write this as

03:50.220 --> 03:53.260
an equivalent resistor because this case is really zero.

03:53.490 --> 03:58.740
So you just got to be careful that you take the limit then you take it properly OK.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.910
Basically this whole network now all of the current that's here there is no reason for it to go through

04:03.910 --> 04:06.040
the path where there is resistance.

04:06.130 --> 04:11.260
You'd rather go through the path where there is no resistance.

04:11.410 --> 04:18.050
So it's simply all going to go out through that outer branch the current here in the center branch.

04:18.100 --> 04:27.310
This guy here one is going to be equal to zero because there is resistance here there is no voltage

04:27.310 --> 04:28.780
drop across here.

04:29.110 --> 04:29.830
Right.

04:29.860 --> 04:35.500
Going between seeing point D There is no voltage drop across there because there's no resistance.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.380
So that means that there can't be any voltage drop across.

04:38.380 --> 04:39.210
Point being.

04:39.230 --> 04:40.450
E.

04:40.870 --> 04:47.350
So if there's no voltage drop across an 8 ohm resistor The only reason you can have that the voltage

04:47.350 --> 04:50.420
drop across the 8 ohm resistor equals to zero.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.880
Well think about it the resistance multiplied by the current one.

04:55.150 --> 04:59.310
So you have to have that the current I want equals zero.

04:59.680 --> 05:00.240
So that's it.

05:00.250 --> 05:09.640
So this simply becomes a single loop circuit where we simply have one battery one TMF and one for ohm

05:09.640 --> 05:10.720
resistor.

05:11.260 --> 05:18.550
So the current I can easily be calculated in this time limit simply going to be 12 divided by four.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.440
We're going to have three amps.

05:21.970 --> 05:24.620
So you're going to have three amps in that short time limit.

05:26.670 --> 05:26.940
All right.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.080
How about now the long time limit.

05:29.700 --> 05:30.960
Well in the long time limit.

05:30.960 --> 05:35.190
Now again we have basically an infinite resistance.

05:35.190 --> 05:41.910
So we initially set up a current here and current going to flow through this form resistor I've closed

05:41.910 --> 05:42.320
the switch.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.710
Now it's been a long time.

05:43.740 --> 05:49.550
Once the current reaches this junction right here what's going to happen well is the current McGlinchey

05:49.560 --> 05:52.320
going to go through the infinite resistance.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.550
No there can't be any current flowing out here.

05:55.830 --> 06:01.160
So this current out here let's call it current Aitu must be equal to zero.

06:03.050 --> 06:06.590
Because the resistance is infinite.

06:06.760 --> 06:12.490
So that means all of that current is flowing through this forum resistor flowing through this 12 volt

06:12.490 --> 06:16.550
battery must flow down here through this 8 ohm resistor.

06:17.790 --> 06:24.510
It's go ahead and just fill in that into our diagram here and that's it again in a long time limit for

06:24.510 --> 06:25.470
the circuit.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.320
We simply have a single loop.

06:27.390 --> 06:30.140
However now we have two resistors that are in this loop.

06:30.180 --> 06:36.600
These resistors are in series with one another the equivalent resistance is 12 ohm So that means and

06:36.600 --> 06:42.620
this time limit the current that we're going to get it to it in a different color here.

06:42.660 --> 06:52.420
So the current I simply going to be 12 divided by our equivalent That's 12 over 12 is going to be equal

06:52.420 --> 06:54.490
to 1.

06:54.610 --> 07:01.590
So we initially had 3 amps and then we're eventually going to get to 1 amp.

07:01.930 --> 07:08.050
Actually if you look at the middle branch right middle branch the initial current was 0 and then the

07:08.050 --> 07:10.640
final current was 1.

07:10.870 --> 07:16.660
And if you look at the outer branch in the outer branch the initial current was three and then it went

07:16.660 --> 07:18.030
towards zero.

07:18.520 --> 07:23.330
So keep that in mind each branch has its own different characteristic right.

07:23.410 --> 07:30.100
The current through the battery started out at three and then it eventually went to one.

07:31.240 --> 07:37.150
So when you mean the short and long time limit short on long time limits I mean what does that mean

07:37.150 --> 07:38.530
in terms of actual time.

07:38.530 --> 07:41.360
How many seconds is that.

07:41.740 --> 07:48.070
In this case it's not very clear what exactly that time limit means but it's typically if you compare

07:48.070 --> 07:55.450
it to some characteristic time scale and a characteristic time scale again you wouldn't know which resistance

07:55.450 --> 07:55.830
to use.

07:55.840 --> 08:01.660
But it's kind of the RC time constant This will give you a pretty good indication whether you use 4

08:01.660 --> 08:06.740
or 8 or whether to use the value of the capacitance we would use six.

08:06.790 --> 08:11.410
But just gives you a rough idea of how many you know kind of an order of magnitude estimate of what

08:11.410 --> 08:15.070
the long and short time scale means for this particular circuit.

08:15.430 --> 08:17.800
It's not exact in this case.

08:17.800 --> 08:24.370
When we have more resistors and more capacitors you can't simply write it as just one value of resistance

08:24.370 --> 08:26.350
one value of capacitance.

08:26.350 --> 08:30.520
You'd have to find what the values of the capacitance in the resistance are that you would use in this

08:30.520 --> 08:30.910
equation.

08:30.910 --> 08:35.200
But just to give you a rough idea it's still going to give you an order of magnitude estimates of what

08:35.200 --> 08:38.030
the long and time limits actually mean for this case.

08:39.420 --> 08:39.700
All right.

08:39.700 --> 08:45.810
So that's the basic analysis technique whenever you're faced with any complex RC circuit.

08:46.240 --> 08:51.730
If you're only interested in these time limits here this is the approach to use simply short out the

08:51.730 --> 08:53.610
capacitor and the short time limit.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.110
And basically

08:58.710 --> 09:01.390
produce an open circuit in a long time limit.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.780
OK so let me just write that down.

09:04.020 --> 09:08.980
Here is an open circuit where the resistance is infinite.

09:09.270 --> 09:10.950
And here it's a shorted circuit

09:13.700 --> 09:15.910
where the resistance is zero.

09:16.460 --> 09:17.060
All right.

09:17.060 --> 09:18.070
Good job everybody.

09:18.110 --> 09:18.990
Hope you understood that.
