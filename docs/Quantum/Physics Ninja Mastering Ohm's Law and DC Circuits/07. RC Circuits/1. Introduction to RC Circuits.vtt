00:00.340 --> 00:10.140
OK so until now what we've done is well all our circuits included earmuffs resistors

00:12.950 --> 00:15.660
and well those were constants.

00:17.980 --> 00:24.470
And when you analyze kind of circuits with only constant amps and resistances it leads to currents it

00:24.470 --> 00:31.930
leads to voltages and it leads to kind of power that are also constant which means they're independent

00:31.930 --> 00:39.360
of time.

00:39.430 --> 00:40.270
So what follows.

00:40.270 --> 00:43.420
Now we're going to include new components in our circuits.

00:43.420 --> 00:45.370
We're going to include capacitors

00:47.950 --> 00:55.310
and capacitors are going to lead to currents voltages to charges to power that depend on time.

00:55.740 --> 00:56.380
OK.

00:56.380 --> 00:58.210
So that's going to be the major difference.

00:58.270 --> 01:03.490
We're going to look in a lot of detail in the section on what is the difference between a charging versus

01:03.490 --> 01:05.770
discharging a capacitor.

01:06.140 --> 01:11.920
The symbol for a capacitor in our circuits are going to be represented by simply just parallel plates

01:11.920 --> 01:14.750
like this.

01:14.950 --> 01:23.140
You remember the units for a capacitor are measured in Feraud And typically you just use the letter

01:23.140 --> 01:30.850
C and again we can have we use prefixes to denote kind of micro Feraud Pico Feraud different values

01:30.850 --> 01:32.750
of the capacitance.

01:32.860 --> 01:40.990
So here's a simple kind of sketch here of a charge capacitor or the capacitor here is initially charged

01:40.990 --> 01:43.270
with some charge q zero on it.

01:43.270 --> 01:48.070
When you define the charge of a capacitor you typically defining that one plate has a positive charge

01:48.400 --> 01:51.610
and the other plate has equal but opposite charge.

01:52.060 --> 01:56.940
However you typically only define it with one letter either Q zero as an initial charge or sometimes

01:56.960 --> 02:01.450
you just use the letter Q And that value now is going to change.

02:01.450 --> 02:08.490
It's going to be a function that depends on time the relationship that's important for capacitors is

02:08.490 --> 02:13.980
that the charge on the plates is proportional to the potential difference between the plates and that's

02:13.980 --> 02:16.860
going to be an important formula for us going forward.

02:16.860 --> 02:24.350
So even at any specific time the charge on the plates again it's proportional to the voltage between

02:24.350 --> 02:25.100
the plates.

02:25.110 --> 02:27.750
Again one of them would be at a higher electrical potential.

02:27.800 --> 02:32.660
The other plate might be at a lower electrical potential and the constant that links them together is

02:32.660 --> 02:35.290
the value of the capacitance.

02:35.790 --> 02:40.880
In case you don't remember this is an important equation for us for capacitors and it doesn't matter

02:40.880 --> 02:42.880
what type of shape the capacitor is.

02:42.890 --> 02:48.650
This formula holds whether you're dealing with parallel plates or concentric tubes or spheres.

02:48.650 --> 02:50.810
It's still the same formula.

02:50.840 --> 02:51.110
All right.

02:51.110 --> 02:52.010
So let's get started.

02:52.010 --> 02:56.090
We're going to learn all about capacitors and how to analyze circuits dealing with capacitors.

02:56.090 --> 03:01.460
The other thing we're going to see a lot of now are switches in our circuits because we're going to

03:01.640 --> 03:04.450
close the switch and see what happens as a function of time.
