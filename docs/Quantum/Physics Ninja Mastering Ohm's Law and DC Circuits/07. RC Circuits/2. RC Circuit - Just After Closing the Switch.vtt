00:00.290 --> 00:04.880
All right first want to consider the case where we're charging a capacitor and we're charging a capacitor

00:04.890 --> 00:09.050
we mean that we have a capacitor that's connected to an IMF.

00:09.300 --> 00:15.930
And in this case we also have a resistor R and I've also included a switch here and at initially the

00:15.930 --> 00:16.850
switch is open.

00:16.920 --> 00:22.010
So if the switch is open basically the resistance of just this part here is infinity.

00:22.020 --> 00:26.310
Therefore there is no current here until I close the switch.

00:26.310 --> 00:32.160
One other comment here initially the charge on the capacitor which I called Q zero right when the switch

00:32.160 --> 00:33.030
is open.

00:33.210 --> 00:38.540
The capacitor is initially uncharged which means it has zero charge on it here.

00:38.640 --> 00:44.490
In addition if the charge is zero remember our fundamental capacitor equation that relates to the charge

00:44.490 --> 00:47.960
on the plates to the voltage on the plates.

00:48.600 --> 00:53.700
So if the charge is initially zero the only way you can have this is if the voltage between the plates

00:53.790 --> 00:54.760
is zero.

00:55.100 --> 00:55.730
OK.

00:56.040 --> 01:02.620
So that means the initial voltage across the plates has to be zero.

01:02.650 --> 01:09.460
OK so let's go ahead now and close the switch so that T goes to zero we close the switch and let's see

01:09.460 --> 01:12.340
what happens though.

01:12.410 --> 01:18.170
I'm going to do is I'm just going to draw a line here just to represent a closed switch.

01:18.970 --> 01:27.880
Once you close the switch now again there is an electric current just like before that electric current

01:27.880 --> 01:28.880
again goes from.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.510
We're talking about the positive electric current.

01:31.710 --> 01:32.840
It's a current I.

01:32.890 --> 01:34.620
That goes like this.

01:35.020 --> 01:39.730
You can imagine if you're an electron anywhere on this segment over here if you're an electron on this

01:39.730 --> 01:45.340
segment where do you want to go you want to head right toward the positive terminal of that battery.

01:45.340 --> 01:51.730
If you're an electron anywhere on this side you want to head farther away from this negative terminal.

01:51.730 --> 01:55.990
So you'd be an electron you'd want to move in this direction which means there is a positive current

01:56.470 --> 01:57.500
initially here.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.190
Flowing like this.

02:02.510 --> 02:06.570
Now that current is not constant that is the key point here.

02:06.830 --> 02:10.550
But there will be a current when you first close the switch.

02:10.610 --> 02:14.890
Now in order to look at this we're going to apply our Kirchoff's voltage law.

02:15.290 --> 02:17.180
What I'm going to do here is I'm going to pick a point.

02:17.240 --> 02:20.450
Let's start over here and let's look at all the voltages.

02:20.450 --> 02:22.550
Let's do a complete loop.

02:22.550 --> 02:27.460
We're going to add all the voltages and see what happens.

02:27.510 --> 02:30.360
And again we said that electrons are going to move away.

02:30.590 --> 02:35.570
If you're on this branch and electrons are going to move onto this plate.

02:35.930 --> 02:42.920
So that means that at some specific time there may be some net negative charge on here and whenever

02:42.920 --> 02:48.560
net negative charge I have on this plate I'm going to have a net positive charge because electrons are

02:48.560 --> 02:50.400
going to move away from this plate.

02:50.810 --> 02:53.990
That charge is always equal and opposite is given by some value.

02:53.990 --> 02:56.060
Q Okay.

02:56.120 --> 02:59.030
Let's go ahead and apply Kirchoff's voltage law.

02:59.630 --> 03:04.330
I'm going to go around here in a clockwise fashion the first thing I encounter is an email.

03:04.550 --> 03:09.680
So I have to add the voltage of that MF.

03:09.790 --> 03:16.000
Now if there is initially a current flowing over here from left to right flowing through the resistor

03:16.030 --> 03:21.280
and I'm going in this direction that means that this point is at a higher electrical potential and that

03:21.280 --> 03:26.770
one that means I'm going to get a voltage drop and the magnitude of that voltage drop is given by Ohm's

03:26.770 --> 03:27.320
law.

03:28.930 --> 03:29.640
OK.

03:30.090 --> 03:32.750
And now I'm also going to get a look at.

03:32.790 --> 03:35.220
I've got a little bit of positive charge on here.

03:35.220 --> 03:37.090
I've got some negative charge on the other plate.

03:37.230 --> 03:44.580
So if I cross I go from a higher electrical potential toward a lower electrical potential and the voltage

03:45.000 --> 03:50.080
drop across the capacitor we're just going to call it visi.

03:50.700 --> 03:52.510
And now I go back to where I started.

03:53.860 --> 03:54.860
It's equal to zero.

03:55.030 --> 03:56.940
Let's call this equation 1.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.780
So this is an important equation.

04:00.400 --> 04:06.010
Now what I'm going to do now is I'm going to use my capacitor equation again the voltage on the capacitor

04:07.000 --> 04:11.510
is related to the charge on the capacitor.

04:11.570 --> 04:18.830
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to isolate the C and I'm going to substitute v c for the value

04:18.830 --> 04:21.630
in my Kirchoff's voltage law.

04:22.940 --> 04:25.730
So let's go ahead and take one one extra step here.

04:25.820 --> 04:28.000
So I still have the voltage of the battery.

04:28.190 --> 04:34.460
I still have the current I a voltage drop across that resistance and now instead of writing v c I'm

04:34.460 --> 04:37.670
simply going to multiply or subtract here.

04:38.090 --> 04:44.480
The charge on the capacitor divided by the value of the capacitance that's is equivalent to the voltage

04:44.480 --> 04:45.660
across the capacitor.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.060
And this is equal to zero.

04:49.070 --> 04:52.010
So now let's go ahead and solve for the current.

04:52.010 --> 04:55.640
So to get for the current Well what you have to do is you simply bring this term on the other side and

04:55.640 --> 04:58.850
you divide through by the resistance.

04:59.030 --> 05:04.130
So you're going to be left with something like this you're going to be left with the IMF divided by

05:04.130 --> 05:09.380
the resistance and then you're going to be left with an another term which is the charge on the plates

05:10.670 --> 05:12.560
divided by this term.

05:12.570 --> 05:14.690
Here are times c.

05:14.810 --> 05:17.660
So this here is an important equation over here.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.980
Now remember what just happened at time equals zero.

05:20.970 --> 05:21.960
What did I say.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.250
I said that a time equals zero.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.690
There is no charge on the plates.

05:26.990 --> 05:34.240
So that means that this term here initially is equal to zero because it was initially uncharged.

05:34.770 --> 05:39.210
So that means that this whole second term here vanishes at time equals to zero when you first close

05:39.210 --> 05:40.530
the switch.

05:41.250 --> 05:50.800
So when you first close the switch the current that you get is equal to the IMF divided by the resistance

05:53.440 --> 05:58.730
this is at Teagle Zero kind of.

05:58.740 --> 06:12.340
Just after closing the switch.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.170
OK so this is an important relationship here.

06:15.210 --> 06:15.620
Go ahead.

06:15.630 --> 06:16.790
Put that in a box.

06:18.600 --> 06:23.790
Actually if you look at this current over here what is that current look like.

06:23.790 --> 06:28.890
This is the exact same current you would get as if there is no capacitor there.

06:30.450 --> 06:30.650
Right.

06:30.650 --> 06:34.770
If there was no capacitor here and you applied Ohm's a lot the circuit Well you'd only have a single

06:34.770 --> 06:39.120
resistance with an MF and you would get this current.

06:39.120 --> 06:44.620
Now the difference if there is no capacitor is that this current here would be the steady state current.

06:44.640 --> 06:50.880
However in this case it's only the instantaneous current that you get immediately after closing the

06:50.880 --> 06:53.340
switch.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.510
Now what's going to happen now.

06:54.510 --> 06:59.970
Well that current You're going to keep on building up charge putting more and more positive charge on

06:59.970 --> 07:05.520
this plate and then putting more and more negative charges on this plate.

07:07.020 --> 07:12.260
And eventually the voltage here of this capacitor starts getting big.

07:12.960 --> 07:19.050
And if you look at now if you compare the electric field produced in the wire there's two sources of

07:19.050 --> 07:20.590
electric fields in the wire.

07:20.590 --> 07:25.920
There is the electric field produced by the battery that's pointing in one direction but now you're

07:25.920 --> 07:32.400
going to start building up a second electric field in the wire produced by the charges on these parallel

07:32.400 --> 07:33.240
plates.

07:35.520 --> 07:40.010
Eventually those are going to cancel out and the current is going to drop to zero.

07:40.500 --> 07:44.010
So here's what it looks like at least qualitatively.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.160
Let's go ahead and make a plot of the current as a function of time

07:50.440 --> 07:52.380
and just make a sketch.

07:53.080 --> 07:58.040
So we know that at time zero this is what we get when we get some value up here and this value is the

07:58.070 --> 08:03.640
IMF the battery divided by the radius divided by the resistance.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.570
Now after a long period time I told you you're going to start building up some charges and eventually

08:07.930 --> 08:11.750
the voltage across the capacitor is going to be equal to the IMF.

08:11.980 --> 08:14.620
And at that time the current will go to zero.

08:16.820 --> 08:21.950
And the way it looks like kind of in between both of those times is it looks like an exponentially decaying

08:22.220 --> 08:25.660
current.

08:25.990 --> 08:30.220
So now what we're going to do is we're going to look at the mathematics involved in calculating the

08:30.220 --> 08:31.650
current as a function of time.

08:32.990 --> 08:38.570
We're also going to look at the charge build up as a function of time and also the voltage difference

08:38.660 --> 08:40.500
across the plates here is a function of time.
