00:00.210 --> 00:04.980
OK there are a few important things I want to highlight about our equation here for the charge on the

00:04.980 --> 00:06.910
plates as a function of time.

00:06.960 --> 00:08.130
This is what we have.

00:08.130 --> 00:14.460
First of all in our limits in the limit that time equals to zero which you see if you substitute zero

00:14.460 --> 00:15.860
in here.

00:15.920 --> 00:16.610
What do you get.

00:16.690 --> 00:22.360
Well you get zero over here and you get one minus exponential of zero is one.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.670
Therefore you're going to get one minus one so you're going to get zero.

00:25.740 --> 00:26.350
And that's what we had.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.660
Right we initially had an uncharged capacitor at the other limit.

00:29.670 --> 00:30.600
You can do is when.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.990
Time tends toward infinity.

00:34.030 --> 00:37.890
Now we know what that case when we analyzed it we got towards some final charge and that's what you're

00:37.890 --> 00:43.410
going to get here in the second term here if you substitute time to be a very big number since it's

00:43.410 --> 00:44.370
negative over here.

00:44.370 --> 00:46.700
This term ends up tending towards zero.

00:46.950 --> 00:51.580
And then you're left with the charge when time is very very big.

00:52.050 --> 00:54.130
It tends toward this value here.

00:54.180 --> 00:59.360
See a capacitance multiplied by the MF of the battery.

00:59.580 --> 01:02.670
So we're OK in those two limits.

01:02.670 --> 01:08.760
At any other time now the benefit of having an equation like this is you are able to calculate for any

01:08.760 --> 01:16.710
now any time if you're given a MF a capacitance any the value of the resistance.

01:16.850 --> 01:21.050
You can actually go ahead and calculate the exact charge.

01:21.420 --> 01:26.400
For example at time t one you can go ahead and calculate how many Coombe's would you have on these plates

01:26.400 --> 01:28.190
as a function of time.

01:28.950 --> 01:33.080
So a couple other important things about this equation.

01:33.120 --> 01:38.460
Number one if we know the charge on the plates remember our capacitor equation right there is our fundamental

01:38.460 --> 01:43.740
kind of capacitor equation that says the charge on the plates is always proportional to the voltage

01:43.740 --> 01:45.500
on the plates.

01:45.510 --> 01:47.650
So imagine you substituted that over here.

01:47.730 --> 01:48.610
Right.

01:48.690 --> 01:54.600
This is the charge as a function of time must be equal to the capacitance as a function of time multiplied

01:54.600 --> 01:56.430
by the voltage is a function of time.

01:56.430 --> 02:02.460
The same equation we just substitute our expression for charge and it's always proportional to the voltage.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.770
So that automatically tells me that the voltage on the plates now is a function of time.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.610
Also has the exact same shape as the charge.

02:10.860 --> 02:11.120
Right.

02:11.130 --> 02:16.180
It just has to have a different unit at the end of the day so you can see on both sides here and cancel

02:16.200 --> 02:21.250
allow the capacitance and I'm left with an expression for voltage as a function of time.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.300
Let me just kind of just erase that.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.000
There you go.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.350
So there's the expression for voltage as a function of time.

02:26.350 --> 02:28.470
It also looks exactly like this.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.070
So the voltage starts at zero when the charge is zero.

02:31.270 --> 02:37.630
And then it tends toward the MFA the battery at time when time is very very long.

02:37.630 --> 02:43.480
Another important fact about this equation here is you notice that this guy here in the denominator

02:43.480 --> 02:50.440
of the exponential function first of all if you look at the units of it you have time in the numerator

02:51.190 --> 02:58.120
that means that the denominator term must also be in units of time because the argument for an exponent

02:58.210 --> 03:00.720
can't have any units.

03:00.760 --> 03:05.540
So actually this value is what you call the RC time constant.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.780
So the RC time constant

03:12.970 --> 03:21.760
sometimes you define it as the letter tau and that's defined simply by the resistance multiplied by

03:21.760 --> 03:24.070
the capacitance.

03:24.070 --> 03:28.020
So what does that mean in terms of kind of this picture over here.

03:28.630 --> 03:34.240
So this shape here would have a particular time constant and it would be equal to the resistance multiplied

03:34.240 --> 03:35.710
by the capacitance.

03:35.800 --> 03:42.660
It kind of tells you how long does it take for you to reach saturation.

03:42.730 --> 03:47.890
I imagine I had a different set up here with a different resistor and a different capacitor.

03:47.890 --> 03:50.060
So I may have a different time constant.

03:50.290 --> 03:54.290
Well you may have a shape that looks like this.

03:54.450 --> 04:01.680
Again you would reach the same saturation value because it's the same potential in the battery but this

04:01.680 --> 04:08.540
one here might have a slightly different time constant let's call it our two C-2 it could also maybe

04:08.540 --> 04:14.610
have a different case something that takes a lot longer to reach saturation.

04:14.610 --> 04:19.520
And this guy here might have a different time constant call it Tao 3 so he'd be a completely different

04:19.520 --> 04:24.320
circuit with a different value of the resistance and a different value of the capacitance.

04:24.410 --> 04:29.080
So this time constant is really a measure of how quickly let's write this down.

04:29.090 --> 04:36.080
So how quickly a capacitor will either charge or discharge quickly see charges.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.750
Let's just do it like this.

04:39.760 --> 04:47.860
So in this case if I have three different time constants tau to be the purple one which would have a

04:47.860 --> 04:52.800
resistance R to in C you see this one here charges pretty fast.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.340
Where is the green one charges a little bit slower.

04:55.350 --> 04:58.520
Any orange one takes the longest amount of time to charge.

04:58.960 --> 05:06.630
So if you were going to rank these time constants you would say that Tau 2 would be the smallest one.

05:06.650 --> 05:16.940
Let's call this one here Tau one or just simply Tau given the given by R C and the last one the biggest

05:16.940 --> 05:21.420
time constant here would be my time constant Tau 3.

05:21.440 --> 05:28.760
So the question is since it's simply just the resistance multiplied by the capacitance you can see there's

05:28.820 --> 05:30.820
only two ways you can make the time constant.

05:30.820 --> 05:31.900
Big or small.

05:32.090 --> 05:32.710
Right.

05:32.930 --> 05:36.070
If I want to make the time constant as small as possible.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.920
Well I either make the resistance very small.

05:39.110 --> 05:44.270
So if you make the resistance very small this is going to charge up really fast if you also make the

05:44.270 --> 05:45.880
capacitance very small.

05:45.890 --> 05:48.400
It's also going to charge up really fast.

05:49.100 --> 05:55.790
If I make the resistance very very big again that initial current ends up being so small that it takes

05:55.790 --> 06:01.160
a longer time for the charge to settle on those plates.

06:01.160 --> 06:07.230
So the next question is how do we actually calculate the current again.

06:07.270 --> 06:12.440
Our equation up here is the equation for the charge as a function of time is very important.

06:12.940 --> 06:18.670
If you take the derivative of this equation with respect to time we can obtain an expression for the

06:18.670 --> 06:19.570
current.

06:20.020 --> 06:24.130
So let's go ahead on the next slide and do that and look at the properties of the current as a function

06:24.130 --> 06:25.650
of time.
