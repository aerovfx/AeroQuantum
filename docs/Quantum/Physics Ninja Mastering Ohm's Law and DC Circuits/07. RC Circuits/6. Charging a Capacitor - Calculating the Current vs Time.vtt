00:00.190 --> 00:06.090
All right one last thing here since we have our equation for the charge as a function of time it's also

00:06.090 --> 00:07.730
important just to look at the current.

00:07.730 --> 00:12.750
Here is a function of time to get the general expression the definition of the current is the rate of

00:12.750 --> 00:16.970
change of the current of the charge rather as a function of time.

00:16.980 --> 00:18.140
Try that again.

00:18.690 --> 00:21.080
OK so the first term is C..

00:21.150 --> 00:25.410
All right if I just multiply that through you take a derivative of a constant that equals to zero you

00:25.410 --> 00:29.610
don't have to worry about that one the next term if we're going to get mine.

00:29.610 --> 00:33.290
See that term is the constant in front of the exponential.

00:33.440 --> 00:39.830
The derivative of this exponential now you're going to get a minus 1 over R C term is going to pop out.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.770
That's the derivative of the exponential.

00:41.880 --> 00:48.910
And then you're left with the exact same term minus T and divided by this time constant R C.

00:49.110 --> 00:49.340
All right.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.580
So let's clean this up a little bit.

00:50.580 --> 00:55.710
You notice you have the capacitance in the numerator and denominator and get rid of that one.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.900
Notice you have a negative sign here and you have a negative sign here.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.350
All right so the last bit.

01:00.370 --> 01:02.100
Let's just clean this up a little bit.

01:02.490 --> 01:07.400
So we get that the current as a function of time equal to.

01:07.680 --> 01:13.760
So the term in the front is simply the IMF of the battery divided by the resistance.

01:13.960 --> 01:23.800
And then we get this exponential and it's a decaying exponential time divided by this RC time constant.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.650
There you go just like that.

01:26.380 --> 01:31.570
So this term here in the front this is basically the initial current.

01:31.570 --> 01:32.390
All right.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.730
You can call it either 0 or IMAX right.

01:35.890 --> 01:40.090
That is the current that you get if you substitute time equals to zero here.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.990
So over here you would get a current of zero right.

01:45.130 --> 01:47.860
Zero doesn't depend on the value of the capacitance.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.050
That's an important fact.

01:49.050 --> 01:49.710
Right.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.540
No dependence on capacitance

01:54.440 --> 01:54.930
not

01:58.440 --> 02:00.650
depend on.

02:00.750 --> 02:05.350
This is going to be kind of important later on when we're going to have more complicated circuits and

02:05.350 --> 02:08.730
we're going to look to solve for what the initial current is.

02:08.740 --> 02:13.330
So basically when you first shut the switch it does though the capacitance is not there.

02:13.330 --> 02:18.820
Sometimes you say it looks like the capacitance is shorted as if there's a wire connecting this plate

02:18.820 --> 02:20.250
to that plate.

02:20.410 --> 02:22.570
Therefore no capacitance whatsoever.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.210
Now on a longtime again this term eventually goes to zero.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.410
So you get simply a function that looks like an exponential decay

02:32.840 --> 02:35.420
something like this.

02:35.420 --> 02:39.020
Now again you could this here has a characteristic decay.

02:39.020 --> 02:44.330
This is not the best exponential decay I've ever drawn but this here is characterized by some time constant

02:44.500 --> 02:50.390
RC which you can calculate and well you can compare other cases right.

02:50.390 --> 02:54.030
What if something decayed pretty fast something like this.

02:54.290 --> 02:57.620
Versus what if something decayed very very slowly.

02:57.700 --> 03:04.170
Right something that decays very slowly has a very long time constant.

03:04.290 --> 03:04.480
Right.

03:04.520 --> 03:09.290
So the time constant for this guy here would be some different value of the resistance some different

03:09.290 --> 03:10.970
value of the capacitance.

03:12.100 --> 03:17.620
So you have a large time constant for the purple one you'd have a very short time constant for this

03:17.620 --> 03:17.990
one.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.390
Right.

03:19.540 --> 03:24.910
So the orange one might represent the case where the resistance is very small.

03:29.370 --> 03:35.280
So initially there is quite a bit of current and again maybe I shouldn't start them off all at the same

03:35.280 --> 03:40.590
spot I really just want to compare their DKs here but I'm just looking at kind of how fast it approaches

03:40.590 --> 03:41.630
zero here.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.350
If the resistance is small the Initially there is a lot of current but then it goes to zero very very

03:46.350 --> 03:47.360
fast.

03:47.700 --> 03:47.990
OK.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.350
So this time constant here T-1 is small

03:55.060 --> 04:01.990
definitely smaller than smaller than this guy and definitely smaller than Tower 3.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.260
OK.

04:03.730 --> 04:07.960
So I just wanted to just close this up now so we've talked about the voltage we've talked about the

04:07.960 --> 04:10.170
charge we've talked about the current.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.810
We kind of have it all our building blocks.
