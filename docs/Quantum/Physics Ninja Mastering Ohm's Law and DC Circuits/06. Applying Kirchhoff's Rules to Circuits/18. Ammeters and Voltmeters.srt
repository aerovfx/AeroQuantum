00:00.540 --> 00:07.470
OK let me just say a few words about different ways of measuring current and voltage we saw we can calculate

00:07.470 --> 00:07.900
it.

00:08.010 --> 00:13.290
If you're doing this in a lab or you're taking a test and they ask you how would you actually measure

00:13.290 --> 00:13.400
it.

00:13.410 --> 00:17.650
Well there are two kinds of voltmeters although nowadays everything is done with a multi meter.

00:17.670 --> 00:22.150
But traditionally an AIM meter is used to measure current.

00:22.250 --> 00:22.780
OK.

00:24.140 --> 00:29.120
And if you're measuring current remember current has to flow through the wire.

00:29.190 --> 00:29.800
OK.

00:29.970 --> 00:35.550
So ammeters so their symbol is represented by this it's a circle with the letter H inside and it's wires

00:35.550 --> 00:36.280
like this.

00:36.450 --> 00:42.370
And the way you connect an ammeter is you always connect an ammeter in series.

00:42.780 --> 00:47.430
So you physically cut the wire you place the ammeter in on each side.

00:47.670 --> 00:52.930
So current is actually going to flow directly through that ammeter.

00:55.310 --> 00:59.910
Since current is flowing through it the resistance of an ammeter.

00:59.930 --> 01:06.700
Every electrical device is going to have some resistance but the resistance is typically very small.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.870
Since it's in series you wouldn't want the resistance of the ammeter to be very big because then that

01:11.870 --> 01:15.110
would change the overall current of the circuit.

01:15.140 --> 01:19.600
So resistance is small for ammeters.

01:19.940 --> 01:22.670
Now you'll never see ammeters connected in parallel.

01:22.670 --> 01:28.010
That doesn't make any sense because if it's connected in parallel and you have a small resistance it

01:28.010 --> 01:30.360
means you're going to have a lot of current going through there.

01:30.360 --> 01:33.060
There is very little resistance to current.

01:33.080 --> 01:36.740
So you really always want them in series.

01:37.580 --> 01:41.840
So you could place them either next to power supplies you can replace them if you have a circuit with

01:41.840 --> 01:46.610
several different branches you just connect the ammeter in each individual branch and you can measure

01:46.610 --> 01:48.280
the current through each branch.

01:50.070 --> 01:55.250
Now volt meter on the other hand here is the symbol for a volt meter here it is shown measuring the

01:55.250 --> 01:59.250
voltage here across this resistance.

01:59.340 --> 02:06.750
So just a circle here with the letter V a volt meter as it says it's measuring the voltage difference.

02:06.750 --> 02:07.210
Right.

02:08.670 --> 02:09.870
Between two points

02:14.230 --> 02:16.430
it's always between two points.

02:20.230 --> 02:24.760
The other important thing about the Volt Meter is that they are always connected in parallel

02:28.090 --> 02:32.600
so you should never see volt meter connected and surgery's.

02:32.720 --> 02:39.370
Now the volt meter itself would be constructed such that it has a very high resistance

02:45.150 --> 02:47.760
and you want something that is connected in parallel.

02:47.790 --> 02:53.520
If you don't want it to disrupt any of the actual circuit that you're measuring.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.830
You want the resistance to be very very high.

02:55.830 --> 02:59.310
So very little current is going to flow through that volt meter.

03:02.110 --> 03:07.160
So you can always use a volt meter to for example can you place a volt meter down over here.

03:08.820 --> 03:17.290
To measure the potential difference across this power supply or I can place a volt meter between both

03:17.290 --> 03:26.610
of those points connected like this to measure the voltage drop across this resistor OK so just keep

03:26.610 --> 03:29.310
that in mind whenever you're dealing with these types of meters here.

03:29.460 --> 03:29.960
OK.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.750
They're connected differently ones in series ones in parallel.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.610
One has a very small resistance.

03:35.610 --> 03:38.960
One would have a very high resistance and their symbols are different.
