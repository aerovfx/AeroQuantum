OK and I want to spend some time looking at multi loops circuits Here's an example of a simple multi

00:06.240 --> 00:12.330
loop circuit and the question is Well how would you solve a circuit like this.

00:12.330 --> 00:15.560
And the question is what I mean what exactly would you try to solve for.

00:15.780 --> 00:20.160
Typically what you're asked to solve for at the beginning is find the current find the current flowing

00:20.160 --> 00:24.880
through the battery and find the current flowing in each branch of this particular circuit.

00:25.260 --> 00:30.510
So the main key at the beginning is to before we apply any of the rules what you want to do at the beginning

00:30.510 --> 00:32.930
is just identify the current in each branch.

00:32.940 --> 00:34.100
Take a guess.

00:34.110 --> 00:38.470
So you pick pick a current direction

00:44.810 --> 00:51.020
for each branch.

00:51.040 --> 00:55.900
So for example for this one here again if there's only one power supply it's kind of the easy to guess

00:55.900 --> 00:58.000
the correct direction.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.860
So in this case here let's just pick a different color here.

01:00.880 --> 01:05.080
I'm going to assume that there's a current eye flowing in this branch over here.

01:05.080 --> 01:10.570
So that means as a current I'm over here right there's a current I everywhere and this branch on the

01:10.570 --> 01:12.300
left hand side.

01:12.460 --> 01:14.010
Now I'm going to label a current.

01:14.020 --> 01:16.210
Now here's a junction over here.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.150
When I call this junction a.

01:18.610 --> 01:23.170
Now there's going to be part of that current that's going to flow down and flow through this two ohm

01:23.170 --> 01:25.310
resistor.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.370
To call this the current one.

01:27.880 --> 01:34.380
And now there's also some of that current Now that's going to flow down through this outer branch when

01:34.390 --> 01:36.500
we call this current Aitu.

01:36.500 --> 01:36.910
OK.

01:37.060 --> 01:42.910
So that's what I mean by picking a direction for each branch and give it a different label because there's

01:42.940 --> 01:46.960
no guarantee that these currents could be the same if they are the same the map will come out at the

01:46.960 --> 01:47.610
end.

01:47.690 --> 01:49.190
It'll work itself out.

01:49.210 --> 01:53.080
But pick a direction give it a different label.

01:53.080 --> 01:53.380
All right.

01:53.380 --> 02:00.890
Number two what I would suggest is if you can try to use an equivalent resistor OK.

02:01.180 --> 02:09.100
If you can simplify the circuit and represent it as a circuit that looks like this all right a 10 volt

02:09.130 --> 02:12.220
MF with one resistor.

02:12.280 --> 02:21.790
Well if you're able to do that and by all means please do that because if I'm able to simplify the circuit

02:21.850 --> 02:23.050
and make it look like this

02:26.670 --> 02:30.920
or my blue resistance here is an equivalent resistance.

02:31.410 --> 02:36.750
And in this case I'd be able to do that because I have 8 ohm resistor that is in parallel with a forum

02:36.750 --> 02:37.680
resistor.

02:37.860 --> 02:42.600
I can combine both of those at the beginning and whatever result I get for that I can then combine it

02:42.600 --> 02:47.060
with a 3 ohm resistor that is in series with it.

02:47.070 --> 02:54.090
So in this case I'd be able to simplify this three resistor network in terms of one equivalent resistance.

02:54.090 --> 03:01.110
And if I'm able to do that while the current that I labeled I appear is actually the same current flowing

03:01.110 --> 03:10.020
over here because all I've done is I've basically taken this point and this point in everything on the

03:10.020 --> 03:14.870
right hand side of both of those points and represented them by an equivalent resistance.

03:14.910 --> 03:18.450
So I haven't changed the current over here flowing through the battery.

03:18.510 --> 03:19.810
It's the same current.

03:19.890 --> 03:22.610
And now I have a current flowing through the equivalent resistance.

03:22.740 --> 03:27.810
But this would give me an immediate way of finding what the current is.

03:28.050 --> 03:33.720
And once you know the current I then you're one step closer to finding the currents I wanted it to because

03:33.720 --> 03:39.630
as it stands when I first kind of label these currents I really have three unknown that I have to solve

03:39.630 --> 03:40.380
for.

03:40.740 --> 03:47.610
And one way of solving for one of those unknown's is by using an equivalent resistance and then solve

03:50.050 --> 03:51.040
to find current

03:54.260 --> 04:06.010
through the battery.

04:06.440 --> 04:09.770
So those are kind of the first two tips I think I would give you.

04:09.770 --> 04:20.480
The next thing is you use Kirchhoff's rules you can use my mind you can see these Kirchoff's voltage

04:20.480 --> 04:25.540
law and that was our age I was our Leupp rule

04:28.610 --> 04:31.710
and we can use the junction rule

04:37.930 --> 04:43.080
for in this case here we have one junction up here we also have another junction up here down here.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.280
They're going to give us the same information.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.670
So the junction rule for this case pretty straightforward.

04:48.670 --> 04:48.870
All right.

04:48.870 --> 04:53.040
The junction rule simply says whatever current flows in has to be what current flows out.

04:53.410 --> 04:58.150
So in this case you simply have whatever current flows into the junction has to be the current flowing

04:58.210 --> 05:02.560
out of the junction which is one plus Aitu.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.440
Actually this is an important equation.

05:05.440 --> 05:12.460
This is allowing me to connect some of those unknown's and the general rule is if you have three unknown's

05:18.510 --> 05:26.550
the minimum you need are three equations in order to solve for those.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.020
So this could be used as one of those equations.

05:29.050 --> 05:34.160
The junction rule can be one equation.

05:34.290 --> 05:37.170
What I could do now is I can use my loop rules.

05:37.420 --> 05:42.570
There's different loop rules here I can set up in the circuit I can think of three of them I can think

05:42.570 --> 05:49.170
of this inner loop here I can think of the outer loop here or I can think of just doing the loop over

05:49.170 --> 05:52.890
on this right hand side of the circuit.

05:53.240 --> 05:53.390
Right.

05:53.390 --> 06:00.300
I could really set up three different loops to get other equations but I or I can use a junction rule

06:00.300 --> 06:04.870
to use one of those equations so you can use a different combination.

06:04.950 --> 06:10.710
Generally what I do is I use one equation from the junction rule and then I use the loop rule to get

06:10.710 --> 06:14.080
the two remaining equations and then I solve for the unknowns.

06:15.240 --> 06:15.540
OK.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.720
And that's kind of a good method to do it.

06:18.760 --> 06:23.330
So let's go ahead and solve now for this particular problem.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.570
We'll set up all the equations and show you how you solve it.

06:26.650 --> 06:32.890
Again I'll first start by using the equivalent resistance and then we're going to use some loop rules

06:33.820 --> 06:36.600
in combination with the junction rule to solve for the unknowns.
