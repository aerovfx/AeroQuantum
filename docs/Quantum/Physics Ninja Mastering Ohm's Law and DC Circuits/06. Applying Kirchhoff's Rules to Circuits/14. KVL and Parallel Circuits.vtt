00:00.510 --> 00:04.710
All right I want to spend just a couple of minutes here just to highlight some important points about

00:04.710 --> 00:08.190
parallel circuits and Kirchoff's voltage law.

00:08.190 --> 00:13.380
Remember our voltage law was if you add up all of the potential differences across the elements when

00:13.380 --> 00:17.560
you perform a closed loop those must sum to zero.

00:17.910 --> 00:21.870
So there's kind of three important aspects that come out of this.

00:21.960 --> 00:30.900
It means number one that if you do this it means that the voltage across any branch between two points.

00:30.910 --> 00:34.450
So for example I have points and be here.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.800
There's a lot of different ways I can go from point A to Point B.

00:37.930 --> 00:43.030
I can go through the battery this way I can go just across the resistance through the three ohm resistor

00:43.300 --> 00:48.420
or through the six ohm resistor it means this law here will look at this in a minute.

00:48.430 --> 00:53.060
It means that the voltage difference between those two points it doesn't matter how you get from 8 to

00:53.070 --> 00:56.950
be the voltage difference has to be the same OK.

00:57.030 --> 01:01.250
Another consequence of this is if the voltage difference is the same between each one.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.720
But they have different resistances right.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.610
Look at this branch here is a six ohm resistance.

01:05.610 --> 01:06.900
This one has a three.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.240
This one here has an equivalent of a three ohm resistance.

01:10.290 --> 01:18.190
So if the voltage difference between these two points is going to be the same but the value of the resistance

01:18.190 --> 01:18.990
is different.

01:19.090 --> 01:24.850
It means that branches that have a large resistance are going to have a small current and that makes

01:24.850 --> 01:25.150
sense.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.850
That's just a consequence of Ohm's law.

01:29.130 --> 01:34.290
And the other consequence is well what happens now if the total resistance is the same if the total

01:34.290 --> 01:35.640
resistance is the same.

01:35.640 --> 01:41.010
You expect that the current to be the same because the voltage drop across going from 8 to B has to

01:41.010 --> 01:43.140
be the same across the branch.

01:43.140 --> 01:44.980
So let's go ahead and show that now.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.580
So what I'm going to do is let's again just label some current values on label total current.

01:50.590 --> 01:51.840
I like this.

01:51.830 --> 01:55.460
Now let's call this branch number one so it's going to have a current one.

01:55.530 --> 02:04.030
This one here is going to have a current two and this one here is going to have a current i3.

02:04.070 --> 02:04.430
All right.

02:04.430 --> 02:10.270
So if you are going to apply the loop rule Well it doesn't matter which one.

02:10.280 --> 02:11.680
Let me say I start down over here.

02:11.690 --> 02:16.510
Let's call this point C and I'm going to go around and do a clockwise loop.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.340
So let's do a clockwise loop around the lower branch here.

02:21.380 --> 02:27.350
First thing you would encounter would be that 12 volt batteries you get plus 12 and then you get a voltage

02:27.350 --> 02:31.660
drop across the one arm resistance and crossing it in the direction of the current.

02:32.150 --> 02:38.210
And then also right after that I'd get another voltage drop across this tumor's is actually what you

02:38.210 --> 02:40.800
would get here would be a voltage drop.

02:41.480 --> 02:48.590
Look something like this so one multiplied by the current one and mine is two multiplied by the current

02:48.860 --> 02:49.820
one.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.390
And that there would have to be equal to zero.

02:52.850 --> 02:57.710
So if you rearrange this equation bring the negative signs on the other side and you can combine both

02:57.710 --> 03:03.300
of those but you're going to get 12 over here has to be equal to what are we going to get.

03:03.320 --> 03:10.390
That's three multiplied by one so that's really the equation for this lower branch.

03:10.390 --> 03:14.410
So let's repeat now for the center branch again the battery term looks the same.

03:14.410 --> 03:15.490
That's plus 12.

03:15.850 --> 03:20.940
And now I'm going to get a voltage drop across that 3 ohm resistance.

03:21.250 --> 03:28.210
That's minus three multiplied by the current two and that equals to zero again bringing the negative

03:28.210 --> 03:29.520
sign on the other side.

03:29.560 --> 03:34.630
What you get here is 12 equals 2 3 2.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.140
There is a equation too.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.010
And the last one.

03:39.010 --> 03:46.510
Same thing except this time it's minus six multiplied by the current three flowing through it.

03:46.540 --> 03:47.250
OK.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.500
I'll bring the negative sign on the other side.

03:49.510 --> 03:53.130
So we get six i3 All right.

03:53.130 --> 03:56.360
So let's look at our three equations over here.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.300
The box them up here so they just.

03:58.380 --> 03:59.370
Nice and clear.

04:01.160 --> 04:09.060
There one there's another one and there's another one you see they're all equal to 12.

04:09.070 --> 04:14.010
So all of these terms on this side on the right hand side must be equal to each other.

04:14.200 --> 04:20.660
So we must have three times either one equals two three times I two.

04:21.310 --> 04:24.750
Well what can we conclude from this equation.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.010
We can conclude we can cancel out those threes.

04:27.010 --> 04:28.060
They're the same.

04:28.210 --> 04:33.050
So you conclude right away that the current one must be equal to the current Aitu.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.020
That's very important so why would their currents be the same.

04:36.310 --> 04:41.620
Well the currents would be the same because this is due to the third point over here because the total

04:41.620 --> 04:47.470
resistance here right the total resistance here is three ohms the total resistance of the center branch

04:47.470 --> 04:52.870
is also three ohms so we see that the resistance is the same for each branch here which means that the

04:52.870 --> 04:55.440
current must be the same.

04:55.660 --> 04:58.330
So let's have a look now at the other equation.

04:58.330 --> 05:00.940
Third one the third one now we have

05:05.760 --> 05:10.190
six i3 must be equal to.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.750
Let's just compare to the first one.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.410
3.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.610
1.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.960
Well what can we cancel out.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.800
Here we can factor out a factor of three here.

05:18.870 --> 05:21.230
If I do that I'm going to be left with this.

05:21.300 --> 05:26.030
So at the end the relationship I get between the current i 1 and I 3 is this one.

05:26.090 --> 05:35.900
It says that the current i3 are two times the current i3 must be equal to the current one.

05:36.510 --> 05:42.050
So I three is simply I 1 divided by 2.

05:42.630 --> 05:47.940
That's another important expression here that we get.

05:48.060 --> 05:55.110
So it says that the current in this upper branch whatever it is it has to be half of the current in

05:55.170 --> 05:59.790
branch number 1 and actually also half of the current and branch number two.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.450
And the reason is half.

06:01.530 --> 06:04.800
Again this comes down to Point number two right.

06:04.800 --> 06:10.630
You get less current flowing in branches that have a higher resistance.

06:10.640 --> 06:11.590
OK.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.260
Again we're dealing with a parallel circuit.

06:14.280 --> 06:18.310
You must have the voltage drop across each branch equal to the same.

06:18.420 --> 06:24.750
And in this case it must also always be equal to 12 volts because that is the drop of the voltage.

06:24.750 --> 06:31.020
If I go along this bottom branch with the battery OK we could have got these relationships directly

06:31.470 --> 06:36.480
if instead of doing a loop starting at point C and going around if I would have done a loop starting

06:36.480 --> 06:43.350
at point A and imagine going around counter-clockwise I would have gotten to this first equation over

06:43.350 --> 06:44.240
here.

06:44.310 --> 06:45.420
Let's go ahead and do that.

06:45.510 --> 06:46.740
Just as a practice.

06:46.980 --> 06:48.800
So I'm going to go from A to B.

06:49.260 --> 06:51.640
Let's call it D and E.

06:51.960 --> 06:57.040
So what if I would go around this loop over here and do a Kirchoff's voltage law.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.710
So the first two terms I would get.

07:00.270 --> 07:05.820
Well again I get the voltage drop terms right here I get minus one.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.630
That's the voltage multiplied by the current.

07:08.670 --> 07:18.580
I want get a voltage drop across the 2 ohm resistor minus two times I won and now I've decided to go

07:18.580 --> 07:27.070
to Point B and then go through the 3 ohm resistor except in this case when I go through the 3 ohm resistor

07:27.070 --> 07:29.970
I'm going in the opposite direction of the current.

07:29.980 --> 07:33.540
So that means that there has to be a voltage gain given by three times.

07:33.550 --> 07:36.800
I too and now I go back to Point A.

07:36.970 --> 07:39.650
I sum up all the voltages those must be able to zero.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.650
And you see you can group both of those terms together.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.830
You're going to get minus three.

07:46.240 --> 07:50.190
One plus three Aitu.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.890
At the end we end up getting.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.610
And this must be equal to zero.

07:54.610 --> 07:56.010
So look at this equation here.

07:56.050 --> 07:58.730
You could factor out those threes.

07:59.090 --> 08:05.540
You can bring one on the other side and you automatically see that one must be equal to the current.

08:05.640 --> 08:13.170
Two because they have the same resistance and so that's kind of an important point to highlight that

08:13.170 --> 08:15.700
comes out of this Kirchoff's voltage law.
