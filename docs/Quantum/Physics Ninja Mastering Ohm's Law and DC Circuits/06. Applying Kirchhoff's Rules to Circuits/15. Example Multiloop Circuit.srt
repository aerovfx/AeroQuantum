WEBVTT

00:00.330 --> 00:02.280
OK so it's like a full example now.

00:02.310 --> 00:04.410
So here's a nice kind of multi loop circuit.

00:04.410 --> 00:09.120
We've got one two three four five resistors and we've got a couple of questions here.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.980
First is find the potential difference across the five ohm resistor.

00:13.050 --> 00:13.420
OK.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.250
Well that's pretty easy.

00:14.250 --> 00:17.320
That's just really Ohm's law right.

00:17.340 --> 00:23.770
The potential differences across any resistor is the value of the resistance multiplied by the current.

00:23.850 --> 00:26.650
I need to find how much current is flowing through there.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.660
And Question 2 says Find the power dissipated by this forum resistor.

00:31.980 --> 00:32.300
OK.

00:32.310 --> 00:35.540
Well the find the power dissipated again that's a simple equation.

00:36.030 --> 00:39.950
It's simply the value of the resistance multiplied by the current squared.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.990
Oh I need to know the current flowing through this forum resistor.

00:42.990 --> 00:43.380
OK.

00:43.500 --> 00:48.690
So this problem here boils down to we've got to find what the current is flowing through each and every

00:48.690 --> 00:49.970
one of these resistors.

00:50.160 --> 00:55.940
So we're going to do let's start by labeling values of currents everywhere and then we'll see how we

00:55.940 --> 00:58.430
could proceed.

00:58.430 --> 00:58.730
All right.

00:58.730 --> 01:06.140
So down here through the battery I mean to call this oops I call this the current down here and this

01:06.140 --> 01:12.770
section right through this first branch here I'm going to call this the current one I'm going to call

01:12.770 --> 01:16.100
the current going appear to be equal to Aitu.

01:16.650 --> 01:17.840
Oh now look what happens here.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.680
Now there is a junction so part of the current is going to go up here part of the current is going to

01:21.680 --> 01:23.300
go down here.

01:23.810 --> 01:30.230
So when you call the current go into the top three current down here to be equal to I4.

01:31.080 --> 01:31.760
All right.

01:31.790 --> 01:33.520
Now they recombine.

01:33.920 --> 01:38.650
So whatever current I too was going in kind of breaks up but then it recombines over here.

01:38.810 --> 01:44.690
So you should also convince yourself you have a current Aitu flowing in this upper branch here through

01:44.690 --> 01:47.620
the form resistor.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.760
OK so that's what all the currents look like.

01:49.780 --> 01:56.470
The next thing I should do is well this looks like a network that I can simplify using the equivalent

01:56.470 --> 01:58.100
resistances.

01:58.150 --> 02:01.850
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to start by kind of getting rid of this.

02:02.050 --> 02:03.280
That looks kind of complicated.

02:03.280 --> 02:07.570
However these are just two resistors that are in parallel with each other.

02:07.930 --> 02:09.550
So I can simplify this.

02:09.550 --> 02:10.450
All right.

02:10.780 --> 02:12.150
Let's just go ahead and do that up here.

02:12.160 --> 02:14.380
Call this our equivalent one.

02:15.090 --> 02:15.500
OK.

02:15.580 --> 02:20.570
And if there's two of them I can apply my little trick you multiply them divided by the sum.

02:21.550 --> 02:31.000
If you add them up that's a team you could simplify 18 18 six goes three times.

02:31.180 --> 02:34.700
I'm left with four looks like OK.

02:34.720 --> 02:40.120
So this whole thing here I can replace with a 400 resistor what's the next thing I can do.

02:40.390 --> 02:44.420
Well each one of these branches now simply has two resistors.

02:44.440 --> 02:48.420
We've gotten rid of this one and represented with a form resistor but that's fine.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.300
And now look what we have.

02:50.350 --> 02:52.060
So I mean redraw this.

02:52.180 --> 02:53.440
So it's over here.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.220
I'm going to try to make it a little bit smaller just to save on space.

02:56.320 --> 03:00.990
So we have a 12 volt battery and we're going to make it teeny tiny here.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.260
We have well three plus five Remember these are in series with one another.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.770
So that's just an 8 ohm resistor.

03:08.890 --> 03:11.310
So let's just substitute it with one value here.

03:12.490 --> 03:13.320
OK.

03:14.360 --> 03:19.110
And close that branch and this guy here is simply eight

03:21.920 --> 03:24.090
or using a rule for series resistors.

03:24.230 --> 03:30.500
And how about the top or the top I just said everything here in the orange blob is for oh then I have

03:30.500 --> 03:32.680
another for all that's pretty easy.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.920
It's also eight.

03:35.160 --> 03:37.110
That's easy.

03:37.220 --> 03:41.290
This problem is turning out to be pretty wimpy.

03:41.780 --> 03:44.900
OK and we have another 8 ohm resistor right here.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.530
OK so how do we combine both of these 8 ohm resistors.

03:48.530 --> 03:50.810
Well again we can use an equivalent resistance and that's it.

03:50.840 --> 03:52.420
This will be the last step.

03:52.430 --> 03:57.860
So it's really the total now equivalent resistance let's just call it our equivalent if you multiply

03:57.860 --> 04:05.330
them and divided by the sum multiply them divided by the sum you get eight times 8 64 64 divided by

04:05.330 --> 04:08.460
16 is four.

04:08.930 --> 04:13.670
Actually one thing you should notice by now is if the resistors are the same and they're in parallel

04:13.670 --> 04:16.500
with each other you always get half the value.

04:16.730 --> 04:20.680
That's always kind of a consequence of multiplying them and divided by the sum.

04:21.130 --> 04:21.690
OK.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.100
Hopefully you've noticed that.

04:24.230 --> 04:24.490
All right.

04:24.500 --> 04:31.160
So this entire network now is equivalent to one simple four ohm resistor are going to draw one last

04:31.160 --> 04:39.950
time down here just to save on space and just remind ourselves that we have an equivalent for home resistor.

04:41.030 --> 04:46.460
And the reason I like to do the equivalent resistance is it's fine if you're able to do it for that

04:46.460 --> 04:47.440
particular circuit.

04:47.450 --> 04:50.790
It's the easiest way to find the current in this bottom branch.

04:50.930 --> 04:55.830
Right because now we have this kind of very very straightforward little circuit down here.

04:55.850 --> 04:58.870
We know the voltage of the battery is still 12.

04:58.940 --> 05:02.730
So guess what the current ideas are you can automatically find with the current.

05:02.790 --> 05:07.310
As it simply the voltage of the battery divided by the total resistance.

05:07.370 --> 05:10.130
So we have to have three amps.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.790
So there's three amps over here and this bottom section.

05:13.820 --> 05:14.090
All right.

05:14.090 --> 05:16.160
Let me go ahead and kind of clear this out here.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.460
This is not required any more.

05:18.770 --> 05:19.380
All right.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.620
Now let's continue.

05:20.750 --> 05:22.520
Roger we've got to go back to our questions.

05:22.610 --> 05:26.900
Really our goal was to find how much current is flowing through here how much current is flowing through

05:26.900 --> 05:27.950
here.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.440
Well maybe I should have deleted that right away.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.130
Actually let's keep that up there for a second.

05:34.130 --> 05:38.020
Well the reason I want to keep this up here is because look what happens.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.430
Right.

05:39.440 --> 05:44.090
We have two branches here that are 8 ohms.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.630
That's the total resistance of each branch.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.400
And we just calculate the current.

05:48.430 --> 05:55.420
I I said there is three amps flowing through the battery and up here.

05:55.460 --> 06:02.180
And once it gets to this junction over here guess what's going to happen if the resistance is the same

06:02.180 --> 06:04.250
we just saw this on the previous video.

06:04.290 --> 06:04.810
Right.

06:04.940 --> 06:08.960
If the resistance is the same what's going to happen to those three amps.

06:09.470 --> 06:16.730
Well it means that the current is going to be evenly divided whatever current flows through here I wonder.

06:16.960 --> 06:24.940
And whenever current flows through here to it has to be they have to be the same because the total resistance

06:24.940 --> 06:27.940
is the same in each one of those branches.

06:28.240 --> 06:35.230
So we have to have that the current one equals to the current Aitu so that automatically means we know

06:35.230 --> 06:37.620
the value because we have three going in.

06:38.200 --> 06:44.960
And if I one has to be equal to Aitu Well guess what if you apply the junction rule here you have three

06:44.960 --> 06:49.530
going in and that must be equal to one plus two.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.570
But those are the same.

06:51.770 --> 06:55.220
So this must be equal to two times I want.

06:55.310 --> 07:03.180
So one has to be equal to three over to her 1.5 and that must be equal to the current Aitu.

07:04.010 --> 07:04.480
OK.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.560
So that's kind of an important relationship.

07:06.860 --> 07:11.270
So we're getting pretty good now at kind of finding currency I think.

07:11.300 --> 07:15.860
All right now that we know that really the currents through and now look at we know the current everywhere

07:15.860 --> 07:24.810
in this this first branch to 1.5 guess what we know also the current up here and we don't know the current

07:24.810 --> 07:28.640
through the six and the 12 but do we really need that for this question.

07:28.650 --> 07:33.990
All we're asking for is what is the power dissipated by this forum resistance to know the power dissipated

07:33.990 --> 07:35.470
by that resistance.

07:35.550 --> 07:40.720
All we need to know is the current flowing through it and that has to be Â£1.5.

07:40.740 --> 07:41.050
All right.

07:41.070 --> 07:43.280
So the last part.

07:43.530 --> 07:44.850
Let's go ahead and calculate.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.080
So this will be question a question B.

07:48.120 --> 07:56.730
So for question a the voltage between this point and this point to call it point 1 and point to that

07:56.730 --> 07:58.180
voltage difference.

07:58.180 --> 08:03.870
And again it's just given by Ohm's law and call a delta V or just call it V if you want against the

08:03.870 --> 08:08.240
value of the resistance are multiplied by the current flowing through it.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.610
We just said it was three over two.

08:11.520 --> 08:11.860
OK.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.900
So we get 15 divided by two.

08:14.040 --> 08:18.550
We get 7.5 volts.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.050
All right.

08:19.050 --> 08:20.100
How about Part B.

08:20.100 --> 08:26.240
Part B says Find the power dissipated in this forum resistance the power dissipated in the forum.

08:26.400 --> 08:32.520
Resistance is given by the value of the resistance which is four multiplied by the current going through

08:32.520 --> 08:32.600
it.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.140
We said again it's 1.5.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.610
Let's call it three over two.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.780
Easier to do the math for me.

08:37.920 --> 08:40.800
And don't forget the square that you get.

08:40.810 --> 08:42.760
So we get four.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.740
Why don't we get three squared is 9 2 squared is four.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.370
Well that's convenient.

08:48.680 --> 08:56.470
And cancel those out and at the end what you're left with is the power dissipated by that for resistance

08:56.530 --> 09:00.680
is given by nine Watts OK.

09:01.130 --> 09:07.070
So there's kind of a nice problem kind of we use some simplifications we use equivalent resistance to

09:07.070 --> 09:13.310
simplify things and we also use the fact that both of these branches had equal resistances that allowed

09:13.310 --> 09:17.060
us to kind of simplify this math a little bit and get to the answer quickly.
