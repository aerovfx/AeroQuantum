00:00.240 --> 00:00.460
All right.

00:00.480 --> 00:06.300
So let's go ahead and actually solve this current solve for the currents here for this multi loop circuit.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.510
So again the first thing I'm going to do I have already identified the direction what I'm going to do

00:09.510 --> 00:13.190
now is I'm going to replace everything here by one equivalent resistance.

00:13.530 --> 00:19.350
So the first thing I want to do is I'm going to combine our two and our three if you combine our two

00:19.350 --> 00:22.010
and our three they are in parallel with each other.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.660
So we're going to call this our equivalent one

00:27.600 --> 00:29.060
in this case here.

00:29.070 --> 00:34.950
You simply multiply them and divided by the sum I multiply them I get eight divided by the sum which

00:34.950 --> 00:36.580
is six.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.910
So at the end you get for over three.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.390
OK.

00:40.710 --> 00:52.200
And then our equivalent total is call it our equivalent down over here is simply adding R1 Plus my intermediate

00:52.260 --> 00:53.640
are equivalent.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.950
So in this case I get three ohms plus for over three.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.730
Put things on a common denominator.

00:59.730 --> 01:03.920
This is nine over three plus for over three.

01:04.560 --> 01:08.020
Gives me 13 over 3 ohms.

01:08.430 --> 01:09.420
So our equivalent

01:12.100 --> 01:22.350
13 over 3 Put that in the calculator gives you approximately 4.3.

01:22.350 --> 01:28.120
All right so I have the value now of my equivalent resistance that is plugged into a tenable battery.

01:28.230 --> 01:31.210
You should be able to find what the current is right.

01:31.260 --> 01:37.410
You can write down ohms law for this or you can do a loop rule here if you want to get plus 10 minus

01:39.660 --> 01:45.400
minus the current multiplied by the equivalent resistance that I just found that must be equal to zero.

01:46.020 --> 01:55.770
So the current is simply equal to 10 divided by the equivalent resistance that's 10 divided by 13 over

01:55.770 --> 01:56.820
3.

01:57.390 --> 02:00.700
So gives me 30 over 13.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.830
Put that in the calculator.

02:01.830 --> 02:05.230
I think I got roughly 2.3.

02:05.470 --> 02:07.660
OK 2.3 pairs.

02:07.710 --> 02:11.870
This is the current over here in this section.

02:12.060 --> 02:16.750
Actually the nice thing is not only is that the current flowing through the battery since the battery

02:16.750 --> 02:19.620
is in series with this resistance are one.

02:19.650 --> 02:23.890
It's also the resistance flowing through here.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.840
So we're done that part.

02:26.630 --> 02:33.060
OK the next part now is well what you want to do now is you want to find the current Iowan want Aitu.

02:33.460 --> 02:38.800
So like I said before what you could do is you could write down a junction rule if you wrote down a

02:38.800 --> 02:46.130
junction rule you would find that let's call this equation one you'd find that the current by are 2.3

02:46.210 --> 02:52.680
that we just solve for must be equal to either one plus the current Aitu.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.120
So now we're left with really two unknowns we're left with.

02:56.140 --> 02:59.600
I want an aitu and we have one equation that links them.

02:59.620 --> 03:03.320
So what you require now is at least one other equation.

03:03.550 --> 03:08.910
Know what you can do one easier way of doing this is simply to do a loop.

03:08.910 --> 03:11.620
It doesn't matter which one you choose lets just choose the loop.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.730
That's the most on the left here.

03:13.750 --> 03:21.410
And again I'm going to go around in the in a clockwise direction and start down here.

03:21.470 --> 03:25.920
The first thing I encounter is that battery will be equation too.

03:26.090 --> 03:28.490
So I get plus 10 volts.

03:28.490 --> 03:34.460
Now I'm going to get a voltage drop across the resistance are one the voltage drop is given by three

03:34.460 --> 03:42.480
times the current I and now if I go down this first branch I'm also going to get a voltage drop and

03:42.480 --> 03:50.370
the voltage drop down that branch is given by two times I won two is the value of the resistance and

03:50.370 --> 03:55.670
the value of the current flowing through here I've labeled it I won and then I go back to where I started.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.130
That must be equal to zero.

03:59.040 --> 04:05.100
Now if I look at equation to look at all the unknowns and equation to you know what the current AI is

04:05.110 --> 04:07.430
so you know what the second term is.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.640
So really the only unknown an equation too is the current.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.160
Actually you can go ahead and solve for that.

04:14.790 --> 04:21.820
So one is simply equal to 10 minus three multiplied by 2.3.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.480
And all of that must be divided by two.

04:26.430 --> 04:33.870
So the current one did things correctly I got about 1.5 5.

04:33.880 --> 04:39.080
All right well once you have this you can then substitute this and equation one.

04:39.190 --> 04:43.150
Another thing I could have done is I could have done a another loop.

04:43.160 --> 04:47.730
It doesn't matter which method you choose at the end as long as you get the same answer.

04:48.750 --> 04:52.590
If you choose the outer loop let's just do it just as an example over here.

04:52.710 --> 04:56.430
The equation is going to look very very similar to equation to the first two terms are going to be the

04:56.430 --> 05:03.830
exact same because I'm crossing the exact same elements let's go over here call this equation 3.

05:03.850 --> 05:08.480
So again you're going to get plus 10 minus 3i which I know.

05:09.040 --> 05:18.250
And then the last part is going down here through this forum resistor and I two equals to zero.

05:18.260 --> 05:25.150
This will give me an expression directly for the current Aitu which is 10 minus 3i divided by four this

05:25.150 --> 05:28.270
time so that have divided by two at the end.

05:28.270 --> 05:35.860
This gives you zero point seven seven five approximately.

05:35.920 --> 05:39.450
So here I've got values for the currents.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.990
Here's the current.

05:41.750 --> 05:47.120
And here's the current I'd to so this is one way of solving for the three currents.

05:47.270 --> 05:47.910
OK.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.440
You needed three different equations actually in this case.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.730
We reduced that to only two equations by using the equivalent resistance method here that allowed us

05:56.730 --> 06:02.160
to find for the current AI and a lot of cases you're able to do that if there are multiple batteries

06:02.160 --> 06:07.590
and you're unable to simplify them you'll still be able to use my rules you'll just have to set up three

06:07.590 --> 06:08.940
independent equations.
