WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:02.880
All right I'm a firm believer that practice makes perfect.

00:02.880 --> 00:09.930
So let's go ahead and practice this voltage law again for a couple more loops we draw the loop here

00:09.970 --> 00:11.910
let's draw this one.

00:11.940 --> 00:17.320
Let's maybe go through the 12 ohm resistor and then through the four and then come back down to Point

00:17.380 --> 00:18.700
A.

00:18.730 --> 00:25.360
So let's go ahead and apply the the the different rules so the first thing I'm going to encounter here

00:25.360 --> 00:31.990
if I start at point A and I move around this region over here I'm going to encounter a MF and I go from

00:31.990 --> 00:36.480
a low to a high potential which means I put plus 12 loops.

00:36.580 --> 00:39.050
Try this again plus 12.

00:39.370 --> 00:41.170
And next thing nothing happens.

00:41.170 --> 00:43.410
I'm just going along the wire here.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.530
The next thing I encounter is a 12 ohm resistor.

00:46.950 --> 00:47.440
OK.

00:47.650 --> 00:50.280
And I'm going in the direction of the current.

00:50.410 --> 00:56.690
If you go in the direction of the current you are going from a high potential to a low electrical potential.

00:56.830 --> 01:00.040
So there is a voltage drop across this resistor.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.780
The voltage drop across this resistor is given by Ohm's law.

01:04.090 --> 01:05.170
First of all to drop.

01:05.170 --> 01:11.740
So we represent that with a negative sign and the magnitude of the drop now is 12 multiplied by the

01:11.740 --> 01:12.230
current.

01:12.260 --> 01:15.700
I for Okay great.

01:15.930 --> 01:23.130
And the last case over here the next thing I encounter here is a 4 ohm resistor.

01:23.170 --> 01:27.540
Again I'm going to get a voltage drop because I'm going from a high electrical potential toward a lower

01:27.540 --> 01:28.980
electrical potential.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.780
The magnitude of the voltage drop is four.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.700
That's the value of the resistance multiplied by the current two.

01:37.020 --> 01:40.700
That's the current flowing through this resistance.

01:40.720 --> 01:47.170
Now I'm at this point in the circuit circuit I go all the way back to point a Kirchoff's voltage law

01:47.170 --> 01:53.240
says if I do a complete loop that's equal to zero pretty good.

01:53.270 --> 01:53.580
All right.

01:53.600 --> 01:59.480
Maybe let's try one more case let's highlight maybe what if I do a different loop let's start from a

01:59.480 --> 02:05.490
different point let's start from this junction over here and go around this tiny little loop.

02:05.510 --> 02:08.700
What happens if I go around just this tiny little loop up here.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.890
Well at the plier rules right.

02:11.900 --> 02:15.130
The only thing I'm going to encounter here are resistors.

02:15.830 --> 02:21.710
So the first thing I encounter if I go around in a counter-clockwise fashion the first thing I encounter

02:21.710 --> 02:28.520
is a 12 ohm resistor and I'm going in the direction of the current I4 which means I'm going from a high

02:28.520 --> 02:35.530
to a low electrical potential so that the voltage drop the voltage drop is given by ohms law and the

02:35.570 --> 02:40.850
voltage drop is minus 12 multiplied by 4.

02:40.850 --> 02:46.500
Notice it's the same term is what I had my previous equation.

02:46.550 --> 02:47.570
All right then what do I do.

02:47.580 --> 02:53.390
I'm just going at the top and now I'm going to cross a six ohm resistor and I'm crossing a resistor

02:53.430 --> 02:57.780
but I'm going from a low to a high electrical potential because I'm going in the opposite direction

02:57.780 --> 02:59.180
of the current.

02:59.220 --> 03:05.340
So this means years of voltage gain and that's given by Ohm's law which is six multiplied by the current

03:05.620 --> 03:09.940
three and that there is equal to zero.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.360
So that said See I have two equations here.

03:12.490 --> 03:18.610
They introduce different values of the currents because there is different voltage drops or voltage

03:18.610 --> 03:23.860
gains depending on the direction and depending which resistor that I'm looking at.

03:23.860 --> 03:26.450
But C.M. able to set up a series of equations.

03:26.540 --> 03:33.040
Now the equation one here is equation 2 I can also do another loop which could include other combinations

03:33.040 --> 03:36.360
of resistors and introduce the current I want if I wanted to.

03:36.790 --> 03:42.730
OK so I have different methods now to introduce different values of the currents at the end the goal

03:42.730 --> 03:46.990
is going to be to solve for these currents so they're going to be unknown's in our equations and we're

03:46.990 --> 03:48.840
going to need to solve them.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.230
We'll see how to do that in just a few minutes.
