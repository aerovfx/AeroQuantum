00:00.070 --> 00:06.270
And I want to show you a slightly different interpretation here of cure cause voltage law just kind

00:06.270 --> 00:09.340
of hopefully makes you understand things a little bit better.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.920
So let's just apply the standard definition to the single loop circuit.

00:13.230 --> 00:17.440
So I only have one power supply one battery and two resistors.

00:17.460 --> 00:21.280
So again the first thing we would have to do would pick a loop.

00:21.840 --> 00:26.310
So we are going to pick the loop AB CD and again I'm going to is going to go around in this clockwise

00:26.310 --> 00:31.290
fashion and I'm going to probably guess that the current is going to flow in this direction and that's

00:31.290 --> 00:33.770
going to be the current flowing there.

00:33.780 --> 00:37.260
So here's the voltage law says you add all the potential differences.

00:37.260 --> 00:37.820
Right.

00:37.830 --> 00:45.820
So when I cross a battery I would get plus the EMR or the battery 9 volt.

00:45.830 --> 00:48.070
I don't know what it is but that would be it.

00:48.080 --> 00:53.930
Now when I cross a resistor going from a high to a low electrical potential I get a voltage drop given

00:53.930 --> 01:04.270
by Ohm's law in this case it would be I times are 1 and now I'm going across a resistance are two.

01:04.380 --> 01:10.790
I get a voltage drop again because I'm crossing that resistance in the direction of the current times

01:10.820 --> 01:12.060
are two and that's it.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.930
Then I go back to where I started.

01:15.030 --> 01:17.400
I have to have that equal to zero.

01:17.430 --> 01:23.820
So you've summed all the differences in potential over all the elements and then that equals to zero.

01:24.030 --> 01:28.950
A slightly different approach here which I'll show in two different ways is to actually not look at

01:28.950 --> 01:29.780
the differences.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.420
Right.

01:30.420 --> 01:33.210
Kirchoff's voltage law looks at all the differences.

01:33.210 --> 01:37.980
But what if you would actually just look at the potential not the difference of potential.

01:37.980 --> 01:43.470
So first let's start over here really what the law says is you really have some potential here which

01:43.470 --> 01:44.560
you don't really know what it is.

01:44.580 --> 01:49.440
But at the end it doesn't matter because you come back to the same point again if you remember that

01:49.440 --> 01:54.660
picture I had of the mountain the actual height doesn't really matter because you start at some height

01:54.690 --> 01:56.590
and then you come back to the same point.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.350
So I'll show you what it means in terms of the potentials are really I'm at some potential here.

02:00.600 --> 02:05.650
And then what happens when I cross a battery is that I gain the potential of the battery.

02:05.760 --> 02:11.310
So I wasn't originally at some voltage and then I gain the voltage of the battery and then when I cross

02:11.310 --> 02:11.970
a resistor.

02:11.970 --> 02:13.730
Now I drop in voltage.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.280
In this case because I'm going from high to low.

02:16.530 --> 02:19.140
So now there's a change.

02:19.170 --> 02:24.720
Times are one and then again I'm going to have a drop in electrical potential when I crossed the second

02:24.720 --> 02:25.440
resistor.

02:26.530 --> 02:32.530
I times are two in at the end will really go back to where I started so that there is equal to the potential

02:32.530 --> 02:34.550
where I started.

02:34.570 --> 02:41.440
Now you see what happens here is wherever you started that this potential is where you end and that

02:41.440 --> 02:46.990
term is on both sides of the equation which means it doesn't really matter where you started what the

02:46.990 --> 02:48.830
absolute value of the potential is.

02:48.850 --> 02:55.870
It's only the sums and differences of the Potentials across the elements that matter and that's true.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.510
Whenever you do a complete loop.

02:58.540 --> 03:02.710
In some cases we're not going to want to do complete loops we might want to measure the voltage between

03:02.710 --> 03:04.490
point A and Point C.

03:04.690 --> 03:08.620
So later on we're going to look at examples where we don't do complete loops and see how that changes

03:08.620 --> 03:09.890
the equations.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.090
But for now we're doing complete loops.

03:12.090 --> 03:13.420
Let's look at the same circuit.

03:13.420 --> 03:16.410
Now what I've done is I've drawn the exact same circuit.

03:16.450 --> 03:22.060
However I'll just make it just kind of drawn into one complete line here instead of making a loop out

03:22.060 --> 03:22.660
of it.

03:23.110 --> 03:26.350
But it starts at a point and it terminates at point.

03:26.950 --> 03:31.200
So again the way this would look like while you'd be at some potential I don't really know what it is

03:31.210 --> 03:35.060
but let's just call it a go.

03:35.730 --> 03:41.220
And the way this looks like now as I travel along the wire the potential doesn't change and the potential

03:41.220 --> 03:43.830
doesn't change because the wires are ideal.

03:43.830 --> 03:49.090
That means the potential would remain constant right up until I hit this battery.

03:49.410 --> 03:55.190
And then what happens now there is a potential gain when I cross the battery when I cross the battery

03:55.200 --> 03:58.070
I go up in voltage like this.

03:58.230 --> 04:06.160
And the amount of increase that I have right here this difference this here is equal to the AMFA the

04:06.160 --> 04:08.620
battery the.

04:08.930 --> 04:14.600
So now I'm right here right after I'm right at the positive edge of the battery and now I'm traveling

04:14.600 --> 04:21.810
toward the resistor along a wire the wire has no resistance there is no voltage drop across it.

04:21.810 --> 04:25.940
So I'm at a concert electrical potential.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.910
All right the next thing I do now I encounter a resistance.

04:29.910 --> 04:36.740
So there is now a voltage drop I go from a high electrical potential toward a low electrical potential.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.880
So in this case now there is a voltage drop.

04:39.930 --> 04:45.850
So I go from a high to Wardlow and this amount of drop here.

04:46.200 --> 04:53.750
So again if you kind of check this out this amount of drop here this term here is given by Ohm's law

04:53.750 --> 05:00.770
which is either current multiplied by the value of the resistance or one the next thing you do now is

05:00.770 --> 05:05.560
you just travel along the wire all the way to the next resistance.

05:05.570 --> 05:12.450
Again what I'm going to see now is another voltage drop and the voltage drop this time is given by.

05:12.740 --> 05:13.490
You bet.

05:13.640 --> 05:18.370
Ohms law let's go ahead and do it with the same color over here.

05:18.370 --> 05:23.070
I continue this line and I measure what this drop here is in potential.

05:23.200 --> 05:29.710
It's given two times are two in this case and at the end where am I.

05:29.710 --> 05:36.790
Well I should be exactly where I was at the beginning and I continue now along this wire I met right

05:36.820 --> 05:41.090
after this resistance and then I continue all the way back to Point A.

05:41.410 --> 05:46.960
So I continue all the way back to Point A and I'm always at the same potential over here.

05:46.960 --> 05:53.430
So at the end the difference from when I started to when I finished is zero.

05:53.580 --> 05:59.300
So that's really kind of the best interpretation I think you can get of what the voltage lies.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.430
Think about these batteries as being pumps.

06:04.730 --> 06:08.200
You increase the potential energy of the charge.

06:08.240 --> 06:12.660
Think about these as being slide's you decrease the potential energy.

06:14.590 --> 06:15.860
So there you have it folks.

06:15.850 --> 06:21.730
There's Kirchoff's voltage law applied to a single loop kind of shown you two different ways of looking

06:21.730 --> 06:22.340
at the picture.
