All right the first of Kirchhoff's rules is referred to as the junction rule and engineering textbooks

00:05.730 --> 00:08.560
refer referred as Kirchoff's current law.

00:09.550 --> 00:15.470
So these sometimes often see it as case C-L Kirchoff's current law and there's Kirchhoff right here

00:15.710 --> 00:18.050
and it basically says this at any junction.

00:18.050 --> 00:21.070
If you add up all the currents they must be equal to zero.

00:21.470 --> 00:32.680
So whatever flows in to a junction we call that a positive current and whatever flows out of a junction

00:32.680 --> 00:34.730
we're going to call that a negative current.

00:35.230 --> 00:35.690
OK.

00:35.920 --> 00:43.080
So and while the junction we have to define a junction is any point where you define a point wherever

00:43.090 --> 00:47.830
you have a wire going in and you could have several wires branching out.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.980
So here's the junction for this simple circuit up here.

00:51.130 --> 00:56.860
If you are going to apply Kirchoff's current law to this junction over here again you're adding them

00:56.860 --> 00:58.970
all up and they have to be equal to zero.

00:58.990 --> 01:03.130
And this is the sign convention whatever flows in defining it as positive.

01:03.130 --> 01:06.870
So in this case we have current one flowing into the junction.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.590
So you'd have positive one and you have two and three that flow out of the junction

01:18.190 --> 01:19.870
then you've added up all the currents.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.450
They have to be equal to zero.

01:23.580 --> 01:27.880
Now if you rearrange this does bring the negative currents on the other side.

01:28.170 --> 01:33.640
You simply have one which equals to Aitu plus three.

01:34.410 --> 01:40.790
So this would be Kirchoff's current law applied to that junction up there.

01:42.220 --> 01:47.830
And what you see is this equation here basically another way of rewriting the some of the currents equals

01:47.830 --> 01:54.160
to zero is simply nice simply to say that whatever current flows in this guy right here

01:58.000 --> 02:01.250
must be equal to the total current flowing out

02:07.440 --> 02:11.390
you think about current as a almost like a water analogy.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.390
Right moving charges.

02:12.380 --> 02:14.810
Think about it is water flowing down a river.

02:14.930 --> 02:21.680
If there is a bifurcation somewhere if the river splits the two parts wherever water was flowing in

02:22.070 --> 02:28.480
has to be the same amount of water flowing out through the two different sections over here.

02:28.550 --> 02:43.430
What it means for charges is Kirchoff's current law is basically a statement of conservation of charge.

02:43.490 --> 02:47.480
That's kind of the origin of this current law and it's pretty easy to apply.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.290
So let's look at a couple of examples.

02:49.580 --> 02:54.320
And you can practice applying the current law to find the unknown currents.
