Hi everybody.

00:01.380 --> 00:06.690
So this is Section 5 entitled A plan Kirchhoff's rules to circuits.

00:06.690 --> 00:11.850
So up until now we've learned quite a few things we talked about Ohm's law and looking at the potential

00:11.850 --> 00:15.820
difference across a resistor that has a current flowing through it.

00:15.840 --> 00:19.370
We talked about the differences between resistivity and resistance.

00:19.380 --> 00:26.430
We've looked at ways of simplifying networks of resistors to make circuits look as simple as possible.

00:26.580 --> 00:32.390
What we haven't done however is we haven't really looked at how to solve a complete circuit problem.

00:32.430 --> 00:39.720
And what I mean by that imagine you take this example of a circuit I have here in front of you the tools

00:39.720 --> 00:44.640
I'd given you up until now haven't really allowed you to calculate what is the current flowing through

00:44.730 --> 00:46.680
each and every one of those resistors.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.060
So that's what we're going to learn how to do.

00:48.060 --> 00:53.850
Now the circuit can be either a single loop or multi loop like the one I'm showing you here.

00:54.270 --> 00:59.730
Also what if you were asked to find what what if what if I attach a volt meter between two points in

00:59.730 --> 01:00.680
a circuit.

01:00.750 --> 01:08.170
It could be between points A and B it could be between this point and this point CND.

01:08.370 --> 01:10.340
What would the volt meter read.

01:10.860 --> 01:17.250
What if I tried to measure the current flowing through each in each individual resistor in this network

01:17.250 --> 01:19.310
how can I calculate the current.

01:19.380 --> 01:24.280
And then once I know the current flowing through each resistor I should be then able to calculate what

01:24.280 --> 01:30.010
the power dissipated by that resistor using some of the tools we already learned how to how to use.

01:30.270 --> 01:35.210
So in what follows here we're going to apply certain set of rules.

01:35.310 --> 01:38.670
There are two rules they're called Kirchhoff's rules for circuits.

01:38.910 --> 01:43.140
It's kind of like following dance steps if you want the dance to look good.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.510
You simply have to follow the steps that I'm going to give you.

01:45.510 --> 01:47.340
And they never fail.

01:47.340 --> 01:52.740
The steps are pretty straightforward and I'm going to teach you how to use them and at the end you're

01:52.740 --> 01:57.340
going to look at any circuit like this and you'll be able to analyze it with ease.
