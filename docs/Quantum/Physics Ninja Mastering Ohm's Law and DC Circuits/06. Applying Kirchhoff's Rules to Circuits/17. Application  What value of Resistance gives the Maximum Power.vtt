Have one more application problem here that I want to look at.

00:03.240 --> 00:08.730
So I've got a real battery a real battery consist of an ideal battery with a internal resistance that

00:08.730 --> 00:10.120
is in series with it.

00:10.260 --> 00:14.670
And now I want to ask the question well I want to connect this battery now to some other resistance

00:15.090 --> 00:17.610
and I want to know for which value of this resistance.

00:17.610 --> 00:20.170
Am I going to get the maximum amount of power.

00:21.230 --> 00:24.570
And the power dissipated by this resistance.

00:24.610 --> 00:28.590
So remember the power being dissipated by any resistance.

00:28.590 --> 00:35.280
In this case I'm interested in this upper case are simply going to be the value of the resistance multiplied

00:35.280 --> 00:36.780
by the currents squared.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.190
Now there's actually two terms here to find the maximum power being dissipated.

00:43.190 --> 00:47.710
Well it depends not only on the value of the resistance but it depends on the currents.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.180
You can't just say you want to maximize the current.

00:50.400 --> 00:50.770
OK.

00:50.900 --> 00:54.840
Because this value of the current here also depends on the value.

00:54.860 --> 00:58.380
So let's start maybe by eliminating the value of the current.

00:58.490 --> 01:03.980
Very easy to find for this particular circuit because we only have two resistors.

01:04.040 --> 01:08.800
So again if you do a loop around here starting at point B.

01:08.870 --> 01:17.330
Kirchoff's loop rule gives us e minus the voltage drop across the internal resistance minus the voltage

01:17.330 --> 01:24.810
drop across the resistance that's plugged in over here to the battery and do a complete loop that has

01:24.810 --> 01:26.020
to be equal to zero.

01:26.400 --> 01:33.780
Again at the end you get that the current flowing in the circuit simply looks like this.

01:33.790 --> 01:37.890
All right so now let's go ahead and substitute this in the expression up here.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.310
So we get our

01:43.850 --> 01:47.550
R plus uppercase R and don't forget the square this guy.

01:47.810 --> 01:50.990
Now let me just group the terms together maybe carry out the square.

01:51.230 --> 01:55.040
So the first term here is the term that involves only the resistance values.

01:56.030 --> 02:02.660
This guy hears our Plus our and I have to square it and everything here gets multiply by the earmuffs

02:02.660 --> 02:03.970
squared.

02:04.580 --> 02:04.830
All right.

02:04.850 --> 02:07.570
So there is our value for the power.

02:07.580 --> 02:12.670
Now the question is which value of R will maximize this.

02:13.090 --> 02:15.260
Well let's do some test cases.

02:15.260 --> 02:20.070
What happens if so do Case 1.

02:20.190 --> 02:22.220
What if our equals zero.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.350
What if there is no resistance.

02:24.570 --> 02:26.250
What power do I get here.

02:26.250 --> 02:29.070
Well if you substitute big R equals zero.

02:29.070 --> 02:30.080
Look what you get.

02:30.270 --> 02:34.410
You get zero appear and you get divided by our squares so that will be fine.

02:34.410 --> 02:40.140
So at the end you're going to get that the power dissipated by that resistance R is actually zero.

02:42.440 --> 02:46.380
So that's doesn't look like a maximum value to me.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.550
Let's try another value.

02:47.630 --> 02:52.820
What happens if I make this resistance very very big.

02:52.940 --> 02:58.380
What if I make are tend toward something very very big tend toward infinity.

02:58.490 --> 02:59.770
Where would you get.

03:00.350 --> 03:04.610
Well now you have to take a limit here because look at the term at the bottom.

03:04.610 --> 03:05.830
The term at the bottom.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.580
Forget about little r if Big R is very very big.

03:09.710 --> 03:09.880
Right.

03:09.880 --> 03:15.400
The dominant term here will be the the upper case value of the resistance here and what you're going

03:15.400 --> 03:18.420
to get here is going to be one divided by R.

03:18.930 --> 03:21.840
So let's maybe carry that out.

03:23.810 --> 03:27.700
And in that case if you divide now by something that's very very big.

03:27.710 --> 03:30.080
So the term at the bottom is always going to be bigger.

03:30.080 --> 03:35.660
And then again that means that in this limit over here the power being dissipated by the resistance

03:36.320 --> 03:43.340
is again is going to be zero in the limit that are equal to infinity or tends toward infinity.

03:43.340 --> 03:49.550
So it must mean that there is some value in between zero and infinity where we're actually going to

03:49.550 --> 03:51.440
get some maximum value.

03:52.570 --> 03:58.640
Right you could try any other value and you're going to get a positive number which means that if I

03:58.640 --> 04:04.460
substitute our equals to zero here and let's just say here is basically infinity there's got to be some

04:04.460 --> 04:10.410
point here in between where we're going to get some maximum value of the power

04:13.500 --> 04:20.180
your own plotting power being dissipated by that resistance versus the value of the resistance.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.640
These were the two cases here illustrated by both of these red points.

04:25.460 --> 04:32.270
All right so now let's try to find what is this actual value of our in or you do this someone do a little

04:32.270 --> 04:41.930
bit of calculus but what is this value of are here where do you get that maximum power.

04:42.710 --> 04:47.500
Again if you remember from calculus while we have an expression here what we want to do now to find

04:47.500 --> 04:56.890
the maximum is we're going to differentiate with respect to our ok in order to differentiate this function

04:56.890 --> 04:57.540
here.

04:57.820 --> 05:02.820
Well actually what I will do first is maybe a little bit careful here.

05:02.860 --> 05:06.350
Let me first rewrite it and then I'll take the derivative.

05:06.620 --> 05:08.050
So let's write it down over here.

05:08.130 --> 05:13.120
And I'm just going to write it in a nice easier form to take the derivative because I'm going to use

05:13.120 --> 05:16.330
the product rule for the derivative.

05:16.330 --> 05:21.670
So I'm going to write the function as are going to bring this term at the top.

05:21.670 --> 05:27.440
And if I do that I just have to switch the exponent minus two.

05:27.540 --> 05:33.830
Then all of that gets multiplied by a constant here which is the IMF of the battery.

05:33.860 --> 05:38.280
Now let's take the derivative of this function here with respect to our.

05:38.700 --> 05:43.380
And what we want to do to find the maximum value we want to set that derivative equals to zero.

05:44.130 --> 05:49.570
OK so we have two functions we don't have to worry about this term over here let's just leave it outside.

05:50.090 --> 05:53.570
That's just a constant term not a function of our.

05:53.570 --> 05:55.310
So I'll take the derivative of the first term.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.630
That's simply one.

05:56.910 --> 05:59.750
So that gets multiplied by the second term.

05:59.750 --> 06:03.160
So right away I'm simply going to write it in the denominator.

06:03.190 --> 06:06.850
See the step.

06:07.220 --> 06:15.020
Now I multo I have to take the derivative of the second term and leave the first term the way it is.

06:15.020 --> 06:23.700
So that looks like minus to our in this term here in the bracket the exponent here has to be reduced

06:23.700 --> 06:29.550
by 1 so that becomes r plus R to raise to the power of 3.

06:29.550 --> 06:31.590
So make sure you kind of understand this step here.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.680
That's kind of a critical step.

06:33.690 --> 06:38.880
Now we have two different fractions over here but they're on different they have a different denominator

06:38.880 --> 06:44.120
so in order to simplify this we're going to do is going to put things on a common denominator.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.060
I'm going to leave this constant term there although I could have just gotten rid of it I guess.

06:49.770 --> 06:50.020
All right.

06:50.020 --> 06:56.360
And the denominator here that I'm going to use is our Plus our race to the third power.

06:56.430 --> 06:58.480
So that means that this term here remains unchanged.

06:58.530 --> 06:59.550
That's minus to our

07:02.530 --> 07:05.580
and this first term here you simply have to add R plus R.

07:05.590 --> 07:09.010
In order to make it equal OK.

07:09.030 --> 07:11.200
Now if we want to set everything equal to zero.

07:11.370 --> 07:16.370
Well now you can factor out or you can simplify some of the terms rather you can get rid of this.

07:16.490 --> 07:20.670
You can get rid of the bottom term and here you can simplify this right.

07:20.670 --> 07:26.070
This is our Plus our minus to our must be equal to zero.

07:26.700 --> 07:31.850
So that means that the R minus r must be equal to zero.

07:31.890 --> 07:38.850
And at the end the last result we get is that the resistance is simply equal to the internal resistance

07:39.330 --> 07:41.820
of the battery.

07:41.820 --> 07:46.870
That is the value that is going to give us a maximum.

07:46.980 --> 07:49.340
So let's clear that up a little bit.

07:49.800 --> 07:56.610
Means when are here equal to the internal resistance you're going to get a maximum power and go ahead

07:56.610 --> 08:01.420
and substitute that back into our expression to find what the actual maximum is.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.900
But that's kind of an interesting result.

08:04.620 --> 08:11.920
Later on when you talk about AC circuits they they call this impedance matching.

08:12.750 --> 08:17.680
If you can impedance match you're going to get the maximum power delivered to the load.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.210
OK.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.940
But it's the same thing that happens here with DC circuits.

08:21.960 --> 08:26.180
You want to get the maximum power being delivered to this resistance.

08:26.250 --> 08:31.980
You set the resistance equal to the internal resistance of the battery and that's how you're going to

08:31.980 --> 08:37.570
get the maximum power delivered to this back to this load or to this resistance.
