WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:05.730
OK what I want to do now is look at the simple case here and this is an application sometimes referred

00:05.730 --> 00:10.820
to as a voltage divider and all we have here are two resistors that are in series with each other.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.810
Very very simple circuit to solve for.

00:13.900 --> 00:14.200
Right.

00:14.220 --> 00:21.120
If you have an M.F. of 10 volts you'd have to have a voltage drop across both of those equal to 10 volts.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.990
That's what the Kirchhoff's loop rule would tell us.

00:25.020 --> 00:31.590
However what if we had another piece of circuitry we had another circuit down over here somewhere but

00:31.590 --> 00:37.800
we weren't able to use 10 volts in order to drive it because that would be supplying too much power.

00:38.070 --> 00:40.800
What you can do actually is you can use a voltage divider.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.850
Let me show you what the principle is so let's first begin by solving this.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.740
Now this circuit over here.

00:47.440 --> 00:47.750
OK.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.820
So first thing we need to do is find how much current Do we have.

00:50.820 --> 00:55.280
So the amount of current that we have again the total resistance.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.640
Our equivalent for this case is simply 10 ohms.

00:59.720 --> 01:06.050
So if the voltage of the battery is given by 10 volts you know that the current that you're going to

01:06.050 --> 01:12.250
get has to be very straightforward.

01:12.290 --> 01:24.020
Now what if you go ahead and let's set some points over here point a point B and point C.

01:24.260 --> 01:31.120
Now the voltage difference between points and point B is not going to be the same as the voltage difference

01:31.120 --> 01:39.940
between Point B and point see if you wanted to find the voltage difference across any resistance.

01:39.940 --> 01:42.260
Well it's very easy you just apply Ohm's law.

01:42.910 --> 01:50.710
So the voltage difference across the resistance are one is given by the resistance are one multiplied

01:50.710 --> 01:52.290
by the current going through it.

01:52.390 --> 01:57.310
We just call it the current I mean rather than substituting this right away elegies I'm going to get

01:57.310 --> 02:03.540
a general formula here for the voltage divider equations and then we'll have a look at it.

02:04.080 --> 02:12.130
Now the next thing I can do is the voltage across the resistance are two is the resistance are two multiplied

02:12.130 --> 02:14.230
by the current.

02:14.230 --> 02:22.280
Now remember where the current comes from the current basically came from our DMF divided by the equivalent

02:22.280 --> 02:30.180
resistance and for this case the equivalent resistance was simply our one plus our two actually you

02:30.180 --> 02:36.690
could see that you can multiply or you can substitute in the current directly into these voltage differences

02:36.780 --> 02:38.160
across each resistor.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.760
And let's see what we get.

02:40.320 --> 02:44.920
So the voltage difference across the resistance are one.

02:45.210 --> 02:53.730
Again it's going to be R1 divided by the total resistance of that circuit are one plus R2 and that gets

02:53.730 --> 03:01.500
multiplied by the IMF of the battery and the voltage difference across the resistance are two ends up

03:01.500 --> 03:05.820
being are two multiplied by the current and the current.

03:05.820 --> 03:09.980
I'm just going to use this expression here rather than the one amp for these numerical values it's 1

03:09.990 --> 03:12.810
amp but let's just get a general expression.

03:13.140 --> 03:22.850
Again you get something like this are one plus are two and this gets multiplied by again the EMI.

03:23.030 --> 03:29.930
So the nice thing about this is you see that the voltage difference across the resistance are one.

03:30.050 --> 03:35.960
Right both of them end up being less and you could see that if you add them up plus the voltage difference

03:35.960 --> 03:39.350
across R2 you have to get BMF of the battery.

03:39.350 --> 03:44.000
Right and that's what you would get because you would get R1 R1 plus R2

03:46.810 --> 03:57.340
multiplied by the IMF Plus the resistance are to divided by our one plus are two multiplied by the EMAC

03:57.370 --> 04:03.790
again combined both of those terms you get are one plus or two in the numerator and that ends up canceling

04:03.790 --> 04:10.060
out our one plus or two in the denominator and multiplied by the EMR.

04:11.090 --> 04:12.060
You can cancel those out.

04:12.060 --> 04:14.300
Those are simply equal to 1.

04:14.320 --> 04:19.080
So you see that the voltage drop across both of those has to be equal to the voltage gain across the

04:19.080 --> 04:21.330
MF for any numbers that you choose.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.110
All right.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.980
So let's go back to our example over here.

04:26.010 --> 04:31.770
So looking at these expressions you can see there that the voltage drop across the forum resistance

04:32.340 --> 04:34.250
is simply going to be four volts.

04:34.380 --> 04:34.820
Right.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.710
So that means actually if you kind of branch this out.

04:39.360 --> 04:45.520
What if I decided to use the voltage difference to drive another circuit.

04:45.620 --> 04:50.950
This might be another circuit altogether that's just represented by this black box over here.

04:51.180 --> 04:54.010
A white box.

04:54.450 --> 04:59.670
So this voltage difference across here is four volts although you didn't have a four volt battery.

04:59.670 --> 05:04.950
You can still use combinations of resistors like this to generate you know if you had a whole different

05:05.220 --> 05:12.150
series of values of resistance at your disposal you can set up a circuit and then you effectively use

05:12.150 --> 05:15.510
a lower voltage to drive a different part of a circuit.

05:15.690 --> 05:21.360
If I wanted to drive a circuit with a 6 volt battery but I didn't have one again I could set something

05:21.360 --> 05:23.360
up like this.

05:23.580 --> 05:29.040
The voltage difference across the six ohm resistance is six volts and you can test that out for yourself.

05:29.090 --> 05:35.080
Right we get a resistance that is 6 ohms and we get a current That's one end.

05:35.100 --> 05:39.000
So we get six volts across this guy over here.

05:39.000 --> 05:48.530
So again you could branch this off and I know that I can now use this to maybe run another circuit or

05:48.530 --> 05:53.980
drive current through motor Magin the motor doesn't want you to have 10 volts.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.600
Power supply would be too much.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.400
It would produce too much current in that motor.

05:58.730 --> 06:02.750
You might want to reduce it and you can do it using a voltage divider application like this.
