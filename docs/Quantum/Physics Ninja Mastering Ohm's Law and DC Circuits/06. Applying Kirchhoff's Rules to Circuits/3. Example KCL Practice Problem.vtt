00:00.610 --> 00:05.050
All right here's an example of let us practice the junction rule and again the junction rule says whatever

00:05.050 --> 00:10.880
flows into a junction and the current has to be the same current flowing out of the junction.

00:11.500 --> 00:15.640
So let's begin by identifying all the various junctions here and the goal here is to determine what

00:15.640 --> 00:20.820
this current AI is all the way over here and this lower right hand branch.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.350
So we've got different junctions.

00:22.370 --> 00:32.130
There's one one call that a label this one be see D and E.

00:32.610 --> 00:37.350
And what we're going to do is we're going to apply the junction rule to each one of those.

00:37.350 --> 00:42.080
Now the reason you can't just immediately go to junction E and write down my junction rule.

00:42.330 --> 00:47.030
Well basically what you're going to be left with are two unknowns and only one equation is actually

00:47.020 --> 00:51.720
where we're going to do is we're just going to work over here from Junction and work our way down all

00:51.720 --> 00:52.880
the way to junction E..

00:54.360 --> 00:56.160
OK so let's practice.

00:56.160 --> 01:00.540
So for junction a how do we apply Kirchoff's current law.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.580
So again what flows into the junction.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.850
Well let's look at it there's two currents flowing in.

01:05.850 --> 01:13.680
So that automatically tells us that whatever current is is at junction a must be flowing out because

01:13.680 --> 01:18.150
you can have three currents all flowing into a junction.

01:18.260 --> 01:22.470
You wouldn't be able to conserve the charge if that was the case.

01:22.540 --> 01:26.620
So let's go ahead and find whatever the current this is again.

01:26.620 --> 01:33.790
Kirchhoff's current law says current flowing in there is a 1 amp from the top flowing in two amps from

01:33.790 --> 01:35.660
the left hand side flowing in.

01:36.010 --> 01:42.530
That must be equal to the current flowing out which must be equal to 3 amps.

01:42.670 --> 01:49.150
So this current over here must be 3 amps junction B is very very similar.

01:49.250 --> 01:58.930
We have two currents flowing in it automatically tells us that the third current must be flowing out.

01:58.940 --> 02:04.340
Let's go ahead and calculate that one square junction B again what's flowing in we just saw there was

02:04.340 --> 02:06.910
3 amps flowing in from the top.

02:07.070 --> 02:13.860
We have 5 amps flowing in from the left hand side that must be what's flowing out of junction B which

02:13.860 --> 02:16.810
is 8 amps.

02:16.850 --> 02:17.160
All right.

02:17.160 --> 02:26.300
Put that on the diagram so you have eight amps along this entire branch of the circuit.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.310
All right let me look at junction and see what's going on.

02:28.310 --> 02:30.450
Junction sees a little bit different.

02:30.530 --> 02:35.430
You're told that there's two amps flowing in from the left hand side or from the right hand side.

02:35.780 --> 02:41.510
And while I look at there's also three amps everywhere and this branch right here although they've only

02:41.510 --> 02:43.660
indicated the value of the current up here.

02:43.820 --> 02:46.060
It's also the same current right here.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.370
This is three.

02:49.450 --> 02:50.550
So let's have a look.

02:50.740 --> 02:56.480
So which direction should the current in this branch over here be directed.

02:56.740 --> 03:01.840
Well if you have two going in you probably know that you probably are going to need another current

03:01.840 --> 03:07.360
flowing in if you have three going out.

03:07.530 --> 03:10.790
Let's call this the current.

03:10.990 --> 03:20.340
I see if you apply the junction rule to junction c you're going to find that you have to plus the current

03:20.480 --> 03:23.900
icy must be equal to 3.

03:24.060 --> 03:28.760
So the current I see must be equal to 1.

03:28.980 --> 03:32.580
Put that one on the diagram and that makes sense right.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.660
You got two plus one gives me three.

03:35.660 --> 03:35.940
All right.

03:35.950 --> 03:41.310
And now that we have this information we can now solve what's going on at Junction D.

03:41.700 --> 03:50.460
If we have 8 going in and you have one going toward the top automatically you should be able to see

03:50.460 --> 03:58.410
that this current And this branch right here has to be flowing down and if I call this just the current

03:58.500 --> 04:05.280
I let's apply the junction rule over here at Junction D which you find is whatever current flowing in

04:05.280 --> 04:06.660
is 8 amps.

04:06.810 --> 04:09.630
This must be equal to the current flowing out.

04:09.660 --> 04:14.870
This must be one plus the current I which is what I was trying to solve for.

04:15.020 --> 04:15.750
So the current.

04:15.750 --> 04:21.290
I must be equal to 70 amps and we know the direction that's clear.

04:24.230 --> 04:30.240
We can actually also find what's going on over here in this branch to the right of junction.

04:30.950 --> 04:37.780
We know we have seven going in and we're told that there is six amps going down.

04:38.030 --> 04:42.070
So that tells us right away that we have to have.

04:42.500 --> 04:43.850
I'm not even going to write down the law.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.200
Now you could just write it down just by inspection.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.920
You have to have one amp going this way.

04:49.100 --> 04:56.950
This way we have seven going in the total current leaving the junction also has to be 70 amps OK.

04:57.220 --> 05:02.440
So here is kind of a nice simple example of applying the junction rule several times define the direction

05:02.440 --> 05:03.040
of the current.
