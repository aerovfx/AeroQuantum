00:00.510 --> 00:02.490
OK so here's another a single loop circuit.

00:02.490 --> 00:06.170
However this time I've included a second MF source.

00:06.240 --> 00:10.100
However if you look at it so it's same as the first and we are a tenable battery here.

00:10.110 --> 00:13.530
Now I have a five year old battery however look at the polarity.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.610
It's kind of opposite of the first one.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.800
So I now want to go ahead and I have two questions.

00:20.820 --> 00:26.100
First one find the current standard question and next one let's have a look at the energy in this circuit

00:26.100 --> 00:29.910
and are the power being supplied and dissipated.

00:29.910 --> 00:34.960
So let's start with the first one again we can apply the loop rule starting at point A.

00:35.260 --> 00:38.280
I always start here it doesn't matter you can start wherever you want.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.810
It makes no difference.

00:39.810 --> 00:46.070
OK so the first thing I encounter Now again the loop rule always implies a direction of the current.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.190
So what we're going to do is we're going to pick a direction of the current.

00:49.380 --> 00:53.460
Since this battery is stronger than now on I'm going to assume that the current is going to go like

00:53.460 --> 00:56.760
this.

00:56.960 --> 01:04.100
So first thing I cross now is the battery and I go from the lower to the higher electrical potential.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.580
Therefore I get plus 10.

01:07.870 --> 01:11.450
Now I cross your resistance in the direction of the current.

01:11.450 --> 01:17.030
I get a voltage drop given by ohms law which is three times I.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.300
That's the same.

01:18.400 --> 01:21.040
Next thing I get another voltage drop.

01:21.490 --> 01:26.740
And now what happens now when I cross a battery going from the positive terminal toward the negative

01:26.740 --> 01:29.650
terminal I get a voltage drop also.

01:29.700 --> 01:30.220
Right.

01:30.310 --> 01:38.160
I go toward a lower electrical potential and that mine is the IMF or the battery or minus 5 volts and

01:38.220 --> 01:39.810
that they I go back to where I start.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.190
That equals to zero.

01:42.190 --> 01:48.700
So you see in this case now you get ten minus five which gives me five minus five I.

01:49.370 --> 01:55.890
So re-arranges equation you're going to get that the current now simply egal to 1 amp OK.

01:56.600 --> 02:05.170
That's the current It's going to be the same through all the various components that I have over here

02:05.770 --> 02:07.060
and it's 1.0.

02:07.230 --> 02:07.880
Okay.

02:08.200 --> 02:13.960
Same over here same going through their same flow in a peer single loop circuit.

02:13.990 --> 02:17.250
All right next let's find the power being supplied.

02:17.650 --> 02:19.650
Well there's 10 volt battery.

02:19.810 --> 02:30.170
If I look at the power from the MF One again it's the value of the IMF multiplied by the amount of current

02:30.170 --> 02:31.970
flowing through it.

02:31.970 --> 02:34.630
So in this case it's 10 volts.

02:34.670 --> 02:35.430
It is less current.

02:35.430 --> 02:42.560
There's only one at this time so this one is providing 10 watts 10 jewel per second.

02:43.310 --> 02:45.800
How about this other MF.

02:45.990 --> 02:53.730
Number two again if the value of the IMF multiplied by the current this is five times the one that's

02:54.690 --> 03:01.150
5 watts OK now we can look at the power being dissipated in the resistors.

03:01.180 --> 03:02.390
You know the formula now.

03:02.520 --> 03:11.230
So the power being dissipated by the 3 ohm resistor the value of the resistance are one multiplied by

03:11.230 --> 03:17.050
the current squared three multiplied by one squared is me three watts

03:20.480 --> 03:28.460
and the last one the power being dissipated by the two resistor the value of the resistance multiplied

03:28.460 --> 03:34.550
by the current squared again two and one squared is me 2 watts

03:37.140 --> 03:37.470
OK.

03:37.470 --> 03:43.650
Now if you look at the total power being dissipated Well you have to sum both of those.

03:43.720 --> 03:44.610
Right.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.540
That's simply 5 watts.

03:48.020 --> 03:52.860
Five watts is basically energy being dissipated as heat most likely.

03:52.870 --> 03:57.470
And However look at how much energy energy is being supplied.

03:57.470 --> 03:58.720
What happens over here actually.

03:58.730 --> 04:00.360
Both of these terms.

04:01.130 --> 04:05.200
Well actually what happens is you look at this battery over here.

04:05.510 --> 04:07.190
This is our dominant battery over here.

04:07.190 --> 04:09.640
It is supplying 10 watts of power.

04:11.280 --> 04:16.370
Five watts is being dissipated in heat.

04:16.650 --> 04:25.130
The other 5 watts that's being delivered by the strong battery here is being absorbed.

04:25.260 --> 04:33.600
This is being absorbed which means you're basically charging this battery you're increasing its energy

04:33.600 --> 04:34.960
at this particular rate.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.920
Charging want to try that again.

04:41.270 --> 04:45.920
Charging the battery.

04:46.170 --> 04:51.470
OK so whenever you have kind of two power supplies like this in one of them is reverse polarity from

04:51.470 --> 04:52.410
the other one.

04:52.490 --> 04:57.940
It is basically you know if you kind of do this energy balance you're going to find an imbalance here.

04:59.380 --> 05:05.460
And the reason for that is that the second the weaker battery tends to be in a charging phase.

05:05.630 --> 05:12.620
OK it's absorbing energy at a particular rate whereas the dominant one is supplying energy to the entire

05:12.620 --> 05:14.380
circuit.
