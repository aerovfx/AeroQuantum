All right the second law which is required in order for us to analyze circuits again is when a Kirchoff's

00:06.960 --> 00:13.800
rules and in engineering textbooks it's often referred to as Kirchoff's voltage law.

00:13.890 --> 00:19.290
I don't really know why Kirchhoff got all the credit for this but nonetheless this is what has referred

00:19.290 --> 00:22.380
to his known way before Kirchoff.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.320
But that's the way life works sometimes.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.070
I call it the loop rule and a loop rule is stated something like this.

00:30.090 --> 00:37.710
It says the sum of the potential differences across all the elements of any closed circuit loop must

00:37.710 --> 00:38.650
be zero.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.920
All right so those are just words.

00:41.070 --> 00:47.040
Let's have a look at the main parts of this first part it says close the circuit loop.

00:47.400 --> 00:55.060
So we're going to have to form closed circuit loops and then it says the sum of the potential differences.

00:55.110 --> 01:00.090
So when we're going to form closed circuit loops let me give you an example here.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.760
So imagine we start over here at Point A.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.920
Well one loop I can do is I can go like this.

01:05.940 --> 01:11.950
I have to form a closed loop and I can come back to Point A.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.320
This is an example of a closed circuit loop.

01:15.760 --> 01:22.160
And it says now if I do that around a closed circuit loop and if I add the potential differences across

01:22.220 --> 01:27.900
all the elements that I find so in this case one element that I would find would be a battery.

01:28.190 --> 01:33.640
Other elements that I would fine if I do this loop I would find a resistor here and I would find a second

01:33.650 --> 01:34.690
resistor.

01:35.150 --> 01:38.800
So in this case for this loop there would be three elements.

01:38.810 --> 01:45.980
And it says if I add up the differences in potential when I cross these three elements and I come back

01:45.980 --> 01:50.420
to the same point that must be equal to zero.

01:50.420 --> 01:52.940
Now another example of a closed loop for this circuit.

01:52.940 --> 01:59.560
Again if I start at point A and other example of a closed loop would be this one here in green you can

01:59.650 --> 02:00.750
go on the other side.

02:00.810 --> 02:02.840
Once I'm here I have to make a decision.

02:02.970 --> 02:06.700
I could go over here and I can come back to Point A.

02:07.040 --> 02:13.290
There is another example of a closed loop where Kirchoff's voltage law would say if you add up all the

02:13.290 --> 02:19.440
potential differences across the battery across the 12 ohm resistor then across the forum resistor you

02:19.440 --> 02:22.500
come back to point A that must be equal to zero.

02:23.220 --> 02:25.150
Now here's a couple more.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.450
Here's a red loop.

02:26.460 --> 02:27.720
Let's start at a different point.

02:27.720 --> 02:35.310
What if I started at point B an example of a closed loop would be this one here.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.390
Here I can go like I have to make a decision here.

02:37.450 --> 02:42.350
Let's go over to the 6:1 it doesn't matter what you choose as you come back over here.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.950
There is an example of a closed loop here I cross a three arm my cross of five AM I go up to the top

02:48.190 --> 02:53.110
I cross a forum then I cross the six ohm resistor and I come back to where I started.

02:53.230 --> 02:59.980
If I would add all the potential differences across these resistors I would get zero.

03:00.760 --> 03:05.680
What I want you to think about it's almost an analogy on this mountain.

03:05.740 --> 03:15.260
What I want you to think about is the potential V as being kind of equivalent to the height some height

03:15.260 --> 03:16.910
on a mountain.

03:17.060 --> 03:26.040
So imagine here I start over here at Point A Well if I want to do a closed loop that means I'm simply

03:26.040 --> 03:29.070
going to go around a path I'm hiking around.

03:29.070 --> 03:36.840
Some things are going to bring me to a higher potential a higher height other paths are going to take

03:36.840 --> 03:38.640
me towards a lower height.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.410
However if I do a closed loop I walk around the mountain.

03:42.420 --> 03:46.430
I go to the top and I come back to where I started.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.930
I'm going to be at the same potential.

03:48.930 --> 03:55.770
I'm going to be at the same height as where I started if I form a closed loop because and since I haven't

03:55.770 --> 04:01.800
changed my height it means that the overall change of potential has to be zero because I'm at the same

04:01.800 --> 04:02.910
point or I started

04:05.780 --> 04:07.690
now even if I started at point eight.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.580
I chose a completely different path.

04:12.410 --> 04:18.140
It really doesn't matter if I sum all the potential differences all the ups and downs and I come back

04:18.140 --> 04:21.040
to the same point I have to be where I started.

04:21.050 --> 04:25.330
So there is no difference between where I started and where I finished.

04:25.400 --> 04:29.710
So this is what we're going to see when we're going across certain elements when we cross batteries

04:31.580 --> 04:36.650
we're going to be adding potential differences or subtracting them will depend now in which direction

04:36.650 --> 04:38.510
we cross the elements.

04:38.570 --> 04:43.010
So we'll have to look at the different types of elements we have to look at what happens when I cross

04:43.010 --> 04:49.910
a battery and what happens when I cross a resistor for example in that first loop I drew which was this

04:49.910 --> 04:51.100
blue one over here.

04:51.380 --> 04:57.380
Well what is the difference if I decided to go around this loop in a clockwise fashion like this versus

04:57.380 --> 05:02.430
counter-clockwise at the end of the day the physics should be the same.

05:02.510 --> 05:06.320
So we've got to make sure that everything works with Kirchoff's voltage law.

05:06.650 --> 05:10.270
So let's now have a look at what happens now when I cross different elements.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.260
And when I cross them in different directions.
