WEBVTT

00:00.540 --> 00:05.760
All right I'm going to teach you now how to apply Kirchhoff's rules or Kirchoff's voltage law when you

00:05.760 --> 00:08.240
form close loops around a circuit.

00:08.730 --> 00:09.720
So rule number one

00:12.640 --> 00:15.670
pick a loop that makes sense.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.740
So we're going to pick the loop where I started over here in the lower right hand corner and I formed

00:21.740 --> 00:27.360
a clockwise loop that went down here and goes in that direction there.

00:27.890 --> 00:31.910
So now you see when I go around this loop I'm going to encounter a battery then I'm going to count or

00:31.910 --> 00:34.010
two resistors.

00:34.010 --> 00:39.830
So when I encounter batteries or earmuffs there's only two loop tools rather

00:43.710 --> 00:51.960
I'm either going across batteries going from the negative side toward the positive side if I do that.

00:52.410 --> 00:53.540
Here's the rule.

00:53.910 --> 00:59.880
So from going from A to B when I cross a battery going from the negative to the positive it means that

00:59.880 --> 01:04.780
I'm going from a lower electrical potential toward a higher electrical potential.

01:04.830 --> 01:09.130
So the potential difference is has to be a positive number.

01:09.240 --> 01:13.790
So when I apply the loop rule that means I would add the potential of the battery when I'm going here.

01:16.230 --> 01:22.170
If I would cross a battery now going in the opposite direction going from the positive toward the negative

01:22.170 --> 01:29.670
terminal that means there's a voltage drop when I cross this battery and the magnitude of the voltage

01:29.670 --> 01:32.250
drop is given by the IMF of the battery.

01:32.640 --> 01:38.510
And the way I characterize a drop across a battery is by putting a negative sign in the front.

01:39.240 --> 01:43.990
So I would put mine is 12 volts when I apply Kirchoff's voltage law.

01:46.860 --> 01:50.790
Now the other things that we're going to encounter when we do our loops are resistors

01:53.630 --> 01:57.170
in order to apply voltage laws to resistors.

01:57.260 --> 02:00.370
We must first know the direction of the current.

02:00.470 --> 02:03.910
Now in many cases we're not given the direction of the current.

02:03.920 --> 02:08.550
In some cases it's pretty easy to guess what the direction of the current is going to be.

02:08.900 --> 02:11.570
But some cases is not very obvious.

02:11.570 --> 02:16.340
So rule number two pick a direction or the current

02:25.270 --> 02:30.210
You don't have to worry about whether your gas is going to be correct or incorrect.

02:30.420 --> 02:33.120
The voltage law is going to take care of all of that.

02:33.130 --> 02:36.700
The only thing you have to do at the beginning of a problem is just pick a direction and just stick

02:36.700 --> 02:39.240
with it for the rest of the problem.

02:39.280 --> 02:44.520
Now if it's a circuit kind of like this one there is a lot of different currents that you can define.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.940
Each branch can have its own current.

02:47.140 --> 02:51.650
For example this center section here I may have a current like this one.

02:51.700 --> 02:55.490
I'm just going to pick the upper branch up here.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.970
I'm going to call this current over here.

02:56.990 --> 02:57.550
Aitu

03:00.280 --> 03:04.670
is the main branch here the current flowing through the battery is also it could be different.

03:05.110 --> 03:06.390
Let's call this just the current.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.090
I.

03:08.350 --> 03:09.840
And how about over here.

03:10.070 --> 03:14.260
Well I have a current Aitu that's in this upper branch

03:17.040 --> 03:21.690
but it hits a junction over here so part of that current is going to split up part of it's going to

03:21.690 --> 03:23.790
flow through the six ohm resistor.

03:27.120 --> 03:33.060
Let's call this i3 part of that current is going to flow through the 12 armor's is there.

03:34.650 --> 03:38.650
Let's call this I4.

03:38.700 --> 03:43.860
So you see just in this one particular circuit I actually have five different currents that I have to

03:43.860 --> 03:46.360
find.

03:46.460 --> 03:49.060
OK so that's pretty simple right.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.490
Rule number one pick a loop that we're going to do.

03:51.550 --> 03:54.690
Rule number 2 says pick a current direction so we've done that.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.720
OK.

03:56.160 --> 04:00.850
And we've identified all the different currents through the different resistors.

04:00.960 --> 04:06.910
So now we're going to have two rules when we cross resistors and the two rules are given here.

04:06.910 --> 04:13.390
Now remember by picking a current direction positive current always flows from high electrical potential

04:13.630 --> 04:16.120
toward lower electrical potential.

04:16.120 --> 04:20.810
So this side of the five ohm resistor is at a higher electrical potential in this one.

04:21.040 --> 04:27.880
And by picking a current direction flowing from left to right we've automatically decided that this

04:27.880 --> 04:32.670
side is at a higher electrical potential than that one.

04:32.670 --> 04:33.830
All right so now.

04:33.990 --> 04:39.360
Well one we're going to do our loops are either going to go from high to low or we're going to go from

04:39.360 --> 04:44.880
low to high depending whether or not we cross a resistor in the direction of the current or opposite

04:44.880 --> 04:47.250
or the direction of the current.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.940
So there's two rules.

04:49.140 --> 04:53.220
Again let's assume here we're going from point A to Point B.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.720
And I've decided that the current flows from left to right.

04:56.880 --> 05:02.340
So here have decided that this case is at a higher electrical potential than this point.

05:02.340 --> 05:12.230
If I cross 8 a B in the opposite direction again if current flows in this case from right to left than

05:12.240 --> 05:18.580
here I would be going from a low electrical potential toward a higher electrical potential.

05:18.580 --> 05:26.560
Ok so if you take the case here in the top figure if I cross in the direction of the current I'm going

05:26.560 --> 05:34.330
from high to low voltage which means there is a voltage drop and the magnitude of the voltage drop is

05:34.330 --> 05:35.790
given by Ohm's law.

05:36.100 --> 05:40.830
It's the current flowing through the resistance multiplied by the value of the resistance.

05:40.930 --> 05:47.020
The way I identify that it's a voltage drop is by putting a negative sign in the front right here.

05:48.140 --> 05:53.750
So the change in potential when you cross a resistor in the direction of the current is negative.

05:53.770 --> 05:56.560
IIR.

05:56.740 --> 06:04.450
Now if you cross a resistance now going opposite of the current That means you're going from a low electrical

06:04.450 --> 06:08.980
potential toward a higher electrical potential.

06:08.980 --> 06:12.360
Now the change in electrical potential is given by Ohm's law.

06:12.370 --> 06:19.360
That's Are the Eagles the I remember in the way we say there's an increase now going toward a higher

06:19.360 --> 06:23.910
electrical potential is by putting a positive sign there.

06:23.950 --> 06:28.870
So let's go ahead now and just apply our loop rules to a couple of loops Let's start with the first

06:28.870 --> 06:33.210
one then I drew this clockwise loop starting at point A.

06:33.250 --> 06:37.530
Let me call this loop number one.

06:37.650 --> 06:39.310
I'll make it in blue.

06:39.350 --> 06:42.240
OK so I've decided to go in the clockwise direction.

06:42.270 --> 06:44.350
The first thing I encounter is a battery.

06:44.580 --> 06:44.840
OK.

06:44.880 --> 06:47.840
So I have to deal with the IMF rules over here.

06:48.300 --> 06:53.910
I'm going from the low to the high which means it's really Casey over here that applies to me.

06:55.050 --> 07:00.570
If I'm applying Kirchoff's voltage law that means I have to add the potential of the battery here.

07:00.690 --> 07:05.970
There is a potential difference equal to 12 volts when I crossed this battery.

07:06.350 --> 07:14.000
Now when I just traveling along a wire there is no change in electrical potential because these wires

07:14.000 --> 07:15.250
are ideal conductors.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.920
They don't have any resistance.

07:17.990 --> 07:22.870
So now the first thing I'm going to encounter now is a three resistance.

07:22.910 --> 07:30.230
So now it's the rules up here that apply when I cross a three ohm resistance in the direction of the

07:30.230 --> 07:31.400
current.

07:32.240 --> 07:38.610
Well again the left side of the three ohm resistance is that a higher electrical potential than the

07:38.610 --> 07:39.330
lower one.

07:39.510 --> 07:45.900
So when I cross it I'm going toward a lower electrical potential that means there's a voltage drop across

07:45.900 --> 07:47.960
the three ohm resistance.

07:48.270 --> 07:51.760
If there's a voltage drop it means it's negative.

07:51.780 --> 07:58.440
The change is negative and the magnitude of that change now is simply given by Ohm's law which is the

07:58.440 --> 08:01.410
value of the resistance multiplied by the current.

08:01.410 --> 08:03.030
Now you have to be a little bit careful.

08:03.060 --> 08:07.140
It's the current flowing through that particular resistance that matters.

08:08.930 --> 08:13.020
All right now the next thing I'm going to encounter is a 5 ohm resistor.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.780
Again there's a voltage drop.

08:16.780 --> 08:28.420
Mine is five multiplied by the current I one and that equals to zero.

08:28.430 --> 08:34.440
All right what I want to do now is let's do the same loop except what I'm going to do now.

08:35.060 --> 08:39.260
So this was here was going around in a clockwise fashion.

08:39.260 --> 08:48.930
What happens if I do the same loop except what if I go around in a counter-clockwise fashion.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.400
Let's go ahead and do that.

08:51.410 --> 08:55.130
So the first thing I encounter now is a 5 ohm resistance.

08:55.160 --> 09:01.220
However when I cross that resist I'm going in the opposite direction of the current I'm going from a

09:01.220 --> 09:04.610
low electrical potential toward a higher electrical potential.

09:04.610 --> 09:10.090
So when I cross it it means that I'm going toward a higher electrical potential and the potential difference

09:10.090 --> 09:11.690
is given by Ohm's law.

09:13.730 --> 09:19.220
Move toward high means the difference is going to be positive in ohms law tells me the magnitude of

09:19.220 --> 09:22.960
that difference five times I won.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.630
The next thing I encounter is that three ohm resistance.

09:26.630 --> 09:30.020
And again I'm moving toward a higher electrical potential.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.590
So I get plus three.

09:32.810 --> 09:40.170
I one that's the voltage gain across that three ohm resistance when I'm traveling in this direction.

09:41.650 --> 09:48.110
Know the last thing I encounter Now if I'm traveling in a counterclockwise fashion is this 12 volt battery

09:48.470 --> 09:55.980
except now I'm crossing this MF and I'm going from a high toward low if I'm crossing from high to low

09:56.100 --> 10:02.370
electrical potential and moving toward a lower electrical potential and I'm moving 12 volts lower and

10:02.370 --> 10:03.830
that equals to zero.

10:05.270 --> 10:10.300
You notice the difference between both of these equations is simply a negative sign.

10:10.510 --> 10:18.580
If I multiply my equation down here my counter-clockwise equation by negative 1 I'm going to get minus

10:18.580 --> 10:29.300
five I won minus three times I won plus 12 volts equals zero and noticed that's the exact same equation.

10:29.920 --> 10:35.190
So you actually haven't changed any of the physics whether you go around clockwise or counter-clockwise.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.160
The only thing you introduce as an overall negative sign which doesn't matter at the end.
