00:00.120 --> 00:03.690
All right I now want to look at single tube circuits and a little bit more detail.

00:03.720 --> 00:08.250
There's three basic questions you need to be able to answer about single loop circuits you need to be

00:08.250 --> 00:11.580
able to find what is the current flowing in the circuit.

00:11.640 --> 00:16.070
You need to be able to find what is the voltage difference between any two points on this circuit.

00:16.410 --> 00:21.780
What's the voltage difference between points being point a point to see him Point A C and B.

00:21.780 --> 00:22.260
Doesn't matter.

00:22.260 --> 00:26.130
Pick any two points you should be able to tell me what is the voltage difference between both of those

00:26.130 --> 00:31.410
points and the last one you need to be able to tell me what is the power being delivered to the circuit

00:31.740 --> 00:34.890
and what is the power being dissipated so we're going to go through all three of these.

00:34.890 --> 00:37.240
Let's start with the current.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.250
Notice there's a singular right.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.420
There's only a single current everywhere there's only a single branch by conservation of charge whatever

00:45.420 --> 00:52.590
current flows here as to be the same current flowing through the resistance are A-one same current flowing

00:52.590 --> 01:00.390
through resistance are to in order to solve for the current one that you can use is Kirchoff's voltage

01:00.390 --> 01:01.230
law.

01:01.320 --> 01:06.620
We can set up an equation start at a point some all the voltage differences across the different elements

01:06.630 --> 01:08.110
when you do a complete loop.

01:08.490 --> 01:12.420
Again the only difference is whether you choose to go clockwise or counter-clockwise but that that'll

01:12.420 --> 01:14.600
be the same answer or you.

01:14.610 --> 01:19.950
In this case we could also simplify this right we have two resistors that are in series with one another

01:20.340 --> 01:25.500
and you can represent them by an equivalent five ohm resistor and you'll get at the end of the day to

01:25.500 --> 01:26.490
the same answer.

01:26.490 --> 01:28.130
So let's go ahead and show you how to do that.

01:28.410 --> 01:34.470
So first way will use the Kirchoff's voltage law first thing we do is I start at point A and I'm going

01:34.470 --> 01:40.260
to go around clockwise I cross a 10 mile battery I go from the low to the high.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.550
That's it.

01:41.550 --> 01:45.030
Next thing I cross a resistor in the direction of the current.

01:45.270 --> 01:49.380
When you do that you get a voltage drop given by the value of the resistance multiplied by the current

01:49.380 --> 01:50.470
flowing through it.

01:51.910 --> 01:56.170
And then I'm going across a two resistor again to get a voltage drop because I'm crossing it in the

01:56.170 --> 02:03.700
direction of the current So I'm going from a high to a lower voltage and the voltage drop is given by

02:03.700 --> 02:04.280
two times.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.420
I for this case.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.490
Then I go all the way to where I started.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.060
That's it.

02:10.060 --> 02:13.080
So rearrange this you can group all of those terms you get minus five.

02:13.090 --> 02:17.450
I at the end you get I then will simply be equal to ten.

02:17.470 --> 02:21.640
Divided by five you get two amps.

02:21.640 --> 02:25.240
So the current in the circuit here has to be equal to two.

02:25.330 --> 02:29.050
It's the same everywhere.

02:29.090 --> 02:35.470
Now if you would have represented this circuit by an equivalent resistance you could have done that

02:35.850 --> 02:38.140
he would have been the battery tenable battery.

02:38.230 --> 02:42.770
That's the same you would have had one single resistor.

02:43.270 --> 02:45.140
Let's give it a different color here.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.400
What it looks something like that.

02:48.500 --> 02:56.200
And then I just close the circuit the value of the equivalent resistance in this case would have simply

02:56.200 --> 02:59.770
been while you simply add both of these up there in series with each other.

02:59.830 --> 03:02.900
So you would have had a 5 ohm equivalent resistance.

03:03.100 --> 03:09.280
And now what you could do is you could apply the voltage Kirchoff's voltage law to this simple circuit

03:09.400 --> 03:15.460
and when you do that it just looks like Ohm's law right because you get plus 10 for here you get plus

03:15.460 --> 03:19.900
10 and then you get a voltage drop across this resistance.

03:19.910 --> 03:24.340
Voltage drop is given by five multiplied by the current flowing through it.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.620
You go back to where you start.

03:25.630 --> 03:29.240
And yes look you get the exact same equation right.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.840
You get I which equals the two amps at the end of the day.

03:32.890 --> 03:35.500
Pretty straightforward.

03:35.500 --> 03:35.920
All right.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.340
So let me go ahead and kind of clean this up a little bit.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.880
This doesn't really get us too far.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.190
So I'm just going to delete this part.

03:42.190 --> 03:46.270
I just want to show you how you complete that.

03:46.270 --> 03:46.950
All right.

03:47.140 --> 03:48.790
So now we know the current everywhere.

03:48.790 --> 03:53.120
The next thing we want to do is how do you find the voltage differences everywhere.

03:53.560 --> 03:58.060
So the voltage differences that I'm going to be interested in here are what is the potential difference

03:58.060 --> 04:00.290
here between Point B and point a.

04:00.790 --> 04:01.990
You might call that VB.

04:01.990 --> 04:03.780
Mine is vitæ.

04:04.210 --> 04:08.530
How do I get that guy to find the voltage differences between two points.

04:08.650 --> 04:11.890
What you end up doing is you're just not doing a complete loop.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.450
So we're going to start at point A.

04:13.450 --> 04:17.870
So right now we're going to be at some potential and this term again you typically don't include it

04:17.890 --> 04:22.390
when you do a full loop because at the end you end up having the same term on the left hand side and

04:22.390 --> 04:24.840
on the right hand side and then it simply cancels out.

04:25.090 --> 04:31.030
But in this case it's not going to cancel out because we're not doing a complete loop so we're going

04:31.030 --> 04:36.690
to start here at some potential and then we're simply going to get all the way to point B OK.

04:36.780 --> 04:40.080
So the first thing I encounter now is a battery.

04:40.320 --> 04:46.340
And when I cross a battery now I'm going to get a plus 10 volts because I'm increasing in electrical

04:46.340 --> 04:48.350
potential when I get there and that's it.

04:48.350 --> 04:53.510
Then I go all the way to point B so I'm going to be at some potential vib once I get there.

04:54.080 --> 04:56.510
So now you have to do is rearrange this equation.

04:56.510 --> 05:00.210
If I rearrange this equation I get VB.

05:00.230 --> 05:01.510
Mine is vitæ.

05:01.910 --> 05:07.160
So this here is the difference of potential between both of those points that there would be equal to

05:07.160 --> 05:09.280
10 volts.

05:09.330 --> 05:12.810
So that's the potential difference between two points.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.630
Now you can choose any two points.

05:14.630 --> 05:17.620
What if I wanted VC mine is VB.

05:18.660 --> 05:19.580
Let's go ahead and do that.

05:19.590 --> 05:22.710
VC mine is VB.

05:22.710 --> 05:24.680
Which one is that where you start now.

05:24.700 --> 05:28.630
VB that is that some potential.

05:28.820 --> 05:34.190
And now I'm going to go again I'm going to cross this three ohm resistance in the direction of the current

05:34.200 --> 05:36.370
So I know there's a voltage drop.

05:36.710 --> 05:39.420
The magnitude of the voltage drop is given by Ohm's law.

05:39.440 --> 05:47.500
That's three multiplied by 2 6 volts and then that's equal to c.

05:47.550 --> 05:56.780
All right so now you rearrange this equation you see that V C minus VB is equal to minus 6 volts this

05:56.780 --> 06:02.480
equation tells me that point C is 6 volts lower then point B.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.300
All right you can imagine that

06:08.150 --> 06:11.710
voltage B is at 10 volts right.

06:11.740 --> 06:18.930
If voltage B is at 10 volts take an example 10 volts right here.

06:18.940 --> 06:27.990
That means that voltage C would be a negative six plus 10 volts would be at 4 volts.

06:28.030 --> 06:30.170
That's what this equation here would tell me.

06:30.180 --> 06:33.580
There are some six volts lower than point B.

06:33.580 --> 06:39.710
Now let's go ahead and maybe find a difference between Point C and point the SO in that case I'm looking

06:39.710 --> 06:42.080
for what is the voltage difference between VD.

06:42.080 --> 06:50.720
Mine is Visi OK in order to find that one again you started Visi and now I get to travel toward point

06:50.720 --> 06:54.570
V The first thing I have to cross is a two arm resistor.

06:54.950 --> 07:03.040
I get a voltage drop given by two multiplied by two and then that's equal to VD rearrange this equation.

07:03.560 --> 07:08.920
You're going to find a D mine v c is equal to minus four volts.

07:12.140 --> 07:21.810
Again what that equation tells me that the point D is 4 volts lower than points C so VC is for Voltz

07:22.350 --> 07:26.560
that means VD should be at zero volts.

07:26.930 --> 07:29.660
Now you don't have to be consecutive points like this.

07:29.750 --> 07:35.570
I can use the same technique to find what is the voltage difference between point A and Point C in that

07:35.570 --> 07:37.850
case I'd be looking for visi.

07:37.850 --> 07:40.960
Mine is V.A.

07:41.150 --> 07:42.510
Again you start at point A.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.140
So you're at some electrical potential.

07:45.340 --> 07:49.360
And now there's two directions you can go you can either go through the battery and through this resistor

07:49.390 --> 07:50.760
or you can go this way.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.560
Let's first go through point B to head toward Point C.

07:54.670 --> 07:58.120
First thing I encounter is tenable battery.

07:58.150 --> 08:00.910
Next thing I encounter is this three ohm resistor.

08:00.910 --> 08:08.810
I know there's a voltage drop of six volts across there and then that's equal to point C so you rearrange

08:08.810 --> 08:11.210
this equation you see that Visi mine is V.A

08:15.110 --> 08:23.630
simply equal to four volts the potential difference between point and point C is four volts.

08:23.630 --> 08:27.770
You would have gotten the same answer now if you would have went this direction here.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.100
You could check that out for yourself.

08:30.440 --> 08:34.450
OK so last thing we had to figure out now is how you calculate the power.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.930
OK so to calculate the power.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.960
Well let's look at first the power being delivered the power being delivered is power being delivered

08:41.960 --> 08:45.570
by this power supply in this case it's our 10 volt battery.

08:45.700 --> 08:52.580
And in this case the power being delivered to a circuit is simply the MF multiplied by the current flowing

08:52.580 --> 08:55.010
through that battery.

08:55.190 --> 09:00.660
We calculated the current was two amps the value the IMF was 10 volts.

09:00.860 --> 09:05.390
Simple calculation 10 multiplied by 2 gives me 20 watts

09:09.040 --> 09:10.930
20 joules per second.

09:11.650 --> 09:16.260
All right the next cases we want to look at what is the power being dissipated.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.370
What happened in my piece here.

09:19.120 --> 09:21.910
The power being dissipated Well there's two resistors.

09:22.060 --> 09:26.920
So each one of those resistors will dissipate some energy per unit time.

09:26.950 --> 09:31.050
So let's find First the power being dissipated by the 3 ohm resistor.

09:32.290 --> 09:34.840
It's kind of the same equation right.

09:34.840 --> 09:40.880
It's the voltage across that resistor multiplied by the current flowing through that resistor.

09:41.390 --> 09:46.270
And a lot of times we write the equation somewhat differently we use Ohm's law just to maybe eliminate

09:46.270 --> 09:50.060
the voltage and just replace it by the resistance and the current.

09:50.110 --> 09:51.060
So you can do that.

09:51.100 --> 09:56.230
So instead of voltage across that resistor Sometimes you just multiply it by the value of the resistance

09:56.260 --> 09:59.710
are 1 times the current flowing through it.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.720
And then you still have the current that goes into the power equation.

10:03.730 --> 10:12.840
So this here simply ends up being R R R 1 I squared like this each equation gives you the exact same

10:12.840 --> 10:14.060
answer it doesn't matter.

10:14.310 --> 10:17.060
So let's maybe just use this one here at the end.

10:17.730 --> 10:23.070
OK so the power being dissipated in the 3 ohm resistor is the value of the resistance which is three

10:23.820 --> 10:28.350
multiplied by the current and just square that current.

10:28.350 --> 10:31.530
So you get four multiply by three you get 12 watts

10:34.490 --> 10:34.840
OK.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.830
So that's our power being dissipated by this resistor.

10:37.830 --> 10:44.250
And the last one we want to know what is the power being dissipated by the 2 ohm resistor in this case

10:44.250 --> 10:50.970
it's the value of the resistance multiplied again by the current squared the same current through all

10:50.970 --> 10:53.470
the different components since it's a single loop circuit.

10:53.730 --> 10:58.480
So in this case do we get to multiply by two squared.

10:58.950 --> 11:03.960
Oh give me four times two gives me eight watts.

11:04.000 --> 11:09.280
One thing that should be evident to you is that the total power that's being delivered to the circuit

11:10.090 --> 11:13.380
is actually equal to the total power being dissipated.

11:13.420 --> 11:14.080
Right.

11:14.230 --> 11:21.100
Both of these resistors dissipate energy per unit time and they dissipate energy at the same rate as

11:21.100 --> 11:24.160
you put in energy into the system.

11:24.630 --> 11:24.870
Right.

11:24.880 --> 11:30.040
Twelve plus eight gives me 20 which equals to the power being delivered by that battery.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.240
You're always going to find this in circuits.

11:32.590 --> 11:33.440
OK.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.760
So anyway those are the three questions that you really need to have a good handle on for single loops

11:38.760 --> 11:39.790
circuits.

11:39.790 --> 11:42.680
Hopefully this clears up some of the questions you had.
