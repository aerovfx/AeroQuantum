All right I want to look at the previous example again except I wanted to show you what happens now.

00:05.610 --> 00:10.410
If when you set your current directions at the beginning of a problem what happens if you pick the wrong

00:10.410 --> 00:11.640
answer.

00:11.640 --> 00:15.450
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep the current eye the way it was set up like this.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.920
Now keep the current eye to the way it is.

00:17.970 --> 00:23.250
Previously I had the current one flowing down through this resistance are two what I'm going to do now

00:23.250 --> 00:26.200
is I'm going to pick something like this.

00:26.490 --> 00:30.720
Imagine here I had initially set up the current I wanted to be in this direction.

00:31.370 --> 00:31.960
OK.

00:32.190 --> 00:36.510
So we're going to resolve the exact same problem except let's look at what happens at the solution now

00:36.510 --> 00:39.150
and how it changes and what it means.

00:39.150 --> 00:44.670
So even if I switch the current direction I would still get the same equivalent resistance.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.650
This really has nothing to do with the current So I'd still get my 13 divided by three which gives me

00:49.650 --> 00:54.160
a total equivalent resistance for this network of 4.3 ohms.

00:54.420 --> 00:57.480
Given this I would still solve for the current AI.

00:57.540 --> 01:03.620
And that's the current flowing through this bottom branch and I would still get my value equal to 2.3.

01:03.630 --> 01:08.460
And again that would simply be obtain the current Iowas a result of taking the voltage of the battery

01:08.460 --> 01:16.890
10 divided by my equivalent resistance which gives me 10 divided by 13 over three.

01:16.890 --> 01:23.360
So that's 30 over 13 which gave me the 2.3 ohms.

01:23.460 --> 01:27.430
Yeah 2.3 amps rather.

01:27.510 --> 01:31.080
OK so right back to where we were.

01:31.750 --> 01:37.910
Now one thing that would immediately change would be the junction rule if you write the junction Roulet

01:37.960 --> 01:44.620
junction over here the junction rule would change if you have the current one flowing up rather than

01:44.620 --> 01:48.040
flowing down the junction rule would now look like this.

01:48.250 --> 01:55.930
Whatever current flows into the junction it's I plus the current one has to be equal to the current

01:56.020 --> 02:01.840
Aitu right because we have two currents flowing in and we have one current flowing out of the junction

02:02.890 --> 02:04.990
so that one would look a little bit different.

02:05.590 --> 02:06.430
And the other the case.

02:06.440 --> 02:11.670
Now while let's imagine doing our loop rule let's do Kirchhoff's loop rule doing this inner loop.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.160
Let's see what would change.

02:13.570 --> 02:15.900
Well it's called this equation too.

02:15.910 --> 02:17.290
So first thing I encounter.

02:17.380 --> 02:24.760
Well that term doesn't change it's still plus 10 because I cross a MF going from the low to a high electrical

02:24.760 --> 02:25.630
potential.

02:25.960 --> 02:30.080
And now I cross a resistance R1 so I get a voltage drop.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.610
That turn doesn't change.

02:31.810 --> 02:37.590
And that's three multiplied by the current 2.3 and.

02:37.640 --> 02:41.420
OK so now I'm going to go down this branch with the current one.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.530
However look at what happens.

02:42.530 --> 02:48.060
Now I'm crossing this resistor and I'm crossing it opposite the direction of the current.

02:48.510 --> 02:53.630
OK which means I'm going toward a higher electrical potential which means you have to I'm increasing

02:53.630 --> 02:58.020
the electrical potential and I'm going to increase it by Ohm's law.

02:58.970 --> 03:05.870
Right by the voltage difference across this resistor which is two multiplied by the current one equals

03:05.870 --> 03:06.960
to zero.

03:07.500 --> 03:13.150
Well if I look at equation 2 again the only unknown in this equation is the current one.

03:13.280 --> 03:18.180
So I can do a little bit of math in order to isolate that unknown and so forth.

03:18.200 --> 03:22.980
So let's go ahead and do that if I bring this term on the other side I get minus two I 1.

03:23.540 --> 03:26.870
And then the equation you should get for I 1 is this.

03:26.870 --> 03:31.270
So it's 10 minus three two point three.

03:31.310 --> 03:35.820
Then at the end you'd probably have to divide through by negative two.

03:35.830 --> 03:37.750
Now you punched the numbers in your calculator.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.640
The one thing you notice here is that this negative sign appears.

03:40.690 --> 03:48.130
Everything else looks the same except the current I get is minus 1.5 5 amps.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.520
I'm not going to go ahead now and solve the outer one.

03:50.650 --> 03:52.970
We're going to get the same answers what we previously did.

03:53.260 --> 03:55.740
But I want to point this out.

03:56.080 --> 04:03.190
So I won is equal to minus 1.5 5.

04:03.220 --> 04:04.770
Now this is an important result.

04:04.870 --> 04:10.770
And whenever you solve our rules.

04:10.920 --> 04:19.380
The juncture rule in combination with the loop rules and if you solve for the currents and you're consistent

04:19.440 --> 04:24.660
when you cross your elements and you've done all the physics right you're consistent with whatever direction

04:24.660 --> 04:28.530
of the current You picked and you end up getting a negative answer like this.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.890
It simply means that your guess was wrong.

04:32.340 --> 04:38.190
So my initial guess here if I got a negative answer for this value it tells me that oh I should go through

04:38.970 --> 04:41.280
and actually switch the direction.

04:42.030 --> 04:47.170
The correct answer is should be a current flowing down like this and call it.

04:47.190 --> 04:49.240
I won OK.

04:49.420 --> 04:54.670
So that's all these negative signs tell me that my guess my initial guess really

04:58.150 --> 04:58.870
was wrong.

05:00.610 --> 05:05.320
So all you have to do then just go back to your diagram switch the direction and then you'll be fine.
